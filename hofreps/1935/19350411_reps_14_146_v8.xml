          <para>The object of this billis to make it clear that the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory by the Seat of Government Supreme Court Act  1933,  will be exercisable in relation to the Territory of Jervis Bay. </para>
          <para>Section  11  of the principal act provides that the Supreme Court shall, in all matters arising under any law of the territory, and generally, in relation to the territory, have certain specified original and appellate jurisdiction. The expression " the territory " is defined by the act to mean the Territory for the Seat of Government. The latter expression, however, does not, in itself, include the Territory of Jervis Bay, and it is doubtful whether the provisions of any other act are effective to give to the expression a constructionwhich would include the Territory of Jervis Bay. </para>
          <para>The jurisdiction given  to  the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory by the principal act was in substitution for the jurisdiction given to the High Court by sections  30b  and  34a  of the Judiciary Act  1903-1927.  The latter jurisdiction, in its turn, was in substitution for that conferred on the High Court by section  8  of the Seat of Government </para>
          <para class="block">Acceptance Act 1909. The jurisdiction given by the last-mentioned act was also, by virtue of section 4 (3) of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915, exercisable in relation to the Territory of Jervis Bay. </para>
          <para>Neither in sections 30b and 34a of the Judiciary Act, nor in the Seat of Government Supreme Court Act, is there any express provision making those enactments applicable to the Territory of Jervis Bay. It may be that section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1932 operates to make the Seat of Government Supreme Court Act apply to the Territory of Jervis Bay. There is, however, considerable doubt as to whether this is so, and for that reason it is clearly necessary to extend the jurisdiction of the court in express terras. That is all that the bill purports to do. </para>

        <para class="block">Under the Patents Act, power is conferred on the High Court or the Supreme Court of the State in which the Patent Officeis situated to hear appeals and to deal with various matters arising under the act. Under section 30 of the act, however, theSupreme Court only may rectify any entry in the Register of Patents. That is the only case in which the framers of the Patents Act drew any distinction between the powers of the High Court and those of the Supreme Court. Section 4 of the act defines the " Supreme Court " as the Supreme Court of the State in which the Patent Office is situated, or a judge thereof. As the Patents Office is no longer situated in a State, but is now in the Territory for the Seat of Government, the definition of "the Supreme Court " requires amendment. It is proposed that the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory shall have jurisdiction in the various matters arising under the act. Previously, applications could be made to the Supreme Court of the State of Victoria, or the High Court, but now it is proposed that applications may be made to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory at Canberra, or the High Court. As the High Court visits the various capita] cities periodically, applicants may approach the High Court in any capital city. Clause 3 of the bill confers on the High Court power to rectify any entry in the Register of Patents. This amendment will bring section 30 into harmony with the rest of the act. The amendments are merely formal and have been necessitated by the removal of the Patents Office to Canberra. </para>

            <para>.- As this measure has reference to the taking of legal proceedings under the principal act I direct the attention of the Government to a weakness in this regard which I think should be rectified. I understand that after a patent has been granted the patentee, in the event of his patent rights being infringed or his patent copied, may obtain a declaration from the Commissioner of Patents to that effect; but, unfortunately, he is unable, without taking legal action, to obtain any redress against those who commit the  offence.  In the case of a poor man this  is a great hardship. A gentleman named Baxter, interested in the boot manufacturing business at Goulburn, patented several of his inventions but his patents were subsequently infringed both in Australia and overseas. Although he obtained a declaration from the Commissioner of Patents to this effect he was unable to obtain any redress except by incurring the expense of protracted legal proceedings through the Supreme Court and probably through the Privy Council ; and he had not sufficient money to do so. Comparatively poor people cannot possibly face expense of that kind. I ask the Government to consider whether provision cannot be made in the principal act to protect patentees in the case of the infringement of their rights. With the law as it is, patentees who are without substantial means are frequently robbed of their rights by moneyed people, and I think an amendment of the act should be introduced to protect them from such an injustice. </para>

            <para>. - I understand that the amendments of the principal act provided for in this bill are consequent upon the transfer of the central administration of the Patents Department from Melbourne to Canberra, and that it is now proposed that patentees, in certain circumstances, shall be permitted to invoke the aid of the High Court in place of that of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Would it not be possible to allow the Supreme Court of Victoria, and also the Supreme Courts of the other States, for that matter, to deal with these matters in so far as they affect the residents within those States, and so avoid placing upon those who seek the aid of the court the expense of coming to Canberra? I understand that, although the High Court visits the capital cities of the various States from time to time, litigation before it is more expensive than litigation before the lower courts. It would straighten out the difficulties arising in matters of this kind. Rather than restrict the scope of litigants is it not possible to give them the opportunity to test their rights in all the States? </para>

It is admitted that the bill does not  go  to the root of the subject. The honorable member for Werriwa is quite aware of that, as he suggested  that at some  future date a bill should be introduced to remove some of  the  disabilities under  which  patentees and prospective patentees labour. But the honorable member was in error in supposing that  in  any circumstances the Commissioner informs a patentee that his patent  has been  infringed. The Commissioner  does not  do  that. </para>

Honorable members will appreciate the fact that this measure has been introduced for a specific purpose, and is one of judicial administration only.

          <para>The honorable member for West Sydney made certain observations concerning the Supreme Court of Victoria. That court could be approached in the past only because the Patent Office was situated in Victoria. It is more convenient for proceedings  to  be taken where the register is. The Patent Office having been transferred to Canberra, Parliament can hardly empower the Supreme Court in one State to take proceedings without empowering all supreme courts in Australia to do so.

          <para class="block">The section proposed to be inserted in the Copyright Act 1912-1933 by clause 2 of  the bill  provides a remedy in case of groundless threats of legal proceedings by  persons claiming  to be owners of copyright.  In  1909, it was found necessary  to insert section  91a in the Patents Act  dealing with  groundless threats by owners  of patents, and in  1919  a  similar section,  section  100a,  was  inserted in the Trade  Marks Act as  regards groundless threats by registered proprietors of trade marks. The  Royal  'Commission on Performing Right recommended that a section on the lines of 91a of the Patents Act be inserted  in the  Copyright. Act. The matter which gives rise to the present amendment is, however, not the recommendation of the royal commission, but a case which was brought under notice after the last federal, elections. Briefly the facts of the caac  are  these. At the last election, several, candidates stood for a certain seat, including two candidates, whom I shall designate A and B, respectively. Each of these candidates maintained that he, and he alone, represented a particular party. " A " printed " How to Vote " cards showing how electors favoring that party should vote. " B " issued " How  to  Vote " cards for supporters of the same party, but showing a different order of preference. Prior to polling day " A " made application to the Registrar  of  Copyrights for the registration of copyright in his " How to Vote " card. He duly received an acknowledgment of his application. On polling day, persons acting on behalf of "A", accompanied by a police officer, went to the distributors  of  " B's " " How to Vote " cards and told them  that  " A " was the owner of the copyright in the " How to Vote " card for that particular party, and, if they did not cease distributing " B's " cards, action would be taken against them under the copyright law. The threat of proceedings had the desired effect - " B's " agents retired from the field. Representations  were  then made to the Government to institute proceedings against "A" for making groundless threats of legal proceedings, but no action was possible, as the copyright law, unlike the patent and trade marks law, provided no remedy to the injured party in such cases. The present bill has been introduced to provide a remedy in such cases. </para>

            <para>.- I endorse what has been said by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> though I view the matter from a different angle. I have had a good deal to do with copyright, and have received threatening letters from persons who claim to hold the copyright of various publications, but who, when inquiries were made, were found to have no rights whatever. If it is proposed to hold a concert in a town hall anywhere these people make similar claims. The organizers are told that they must not hold their concert without first submitting a programme to the claimants, so that they may see whether or not there is anything on the programme over which they hold copyright. Organizations with which I am connected have challenged these claimants again and again, and we have found that, out of every 100 claims they make, they actually possess rights in regard to not more than five. Every B-class broadcasting station is being robbed to-day by the same interests. When this bill is passed the public will enjoy some measure of protection, because the onus will be on the claimant to prove his claim. </para>

            <para>. -  I doubt whether the bill will provide all the relief it is supposed to, but it is nevertheless desirable that people should be protected against the threats of persons who claim to possess copyrights, but who do not, in fact, possess them. If  a  person  possesses actual copyrights - and I do not think that mere registration of copyright gives it - he will be able to take proceedings against anybody who, he alleges, infringes them. However, he will be forbidden to threaten proceedings unless, at the earliest opportunity, he actually takes them. If he offends against this provision, the person injured by the threat will be able to obtain legal redress by injunction, or, possibly, damages. In the case referred to by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> it is difficult to see how the injured person could have obtained damages, I regard the bill as a step in the right direction, and I commend  the Government for having brought it down. </para>

          <para class="block">Few members of this House, or of the public generally, can feel satisfied with the report of the Royal Commission on Petrol and Oil, which was tabled in this. House recently. I have to confess that,, owing to the size of both the majority and minority reports, I have not been able to study them fully; but, from an. examination of the summaries, it is evident not only that the commission cost the public a great deal of money without having achieved anything worth while, but also that the reports are, in some important respects, open to grave distrust and suspicion. The commission has cost the taxpayers £12,049. </para>

              <para>- That is so. We may take it that the total cost of the commission is not less than £14,000. The  chairman  collected £2,300 in fees, and one of the members, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hancock,</inline> received £2,700. Generally speaking, the recommendations of the commission are meagre and inconclusive, and do not reveal the iniquities which surround the operations of those engaged in the petrol and oil industry in Australia. On one .phase of the report, at least, suspicion rests, namely, that in regard to the evidence given <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> concerning the profits of the major oil companies. On page 24, the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Lamb,</inline> declares in his summary that his two colleagues, Messrs. Gunn and Hancock, prevented him from disclosing that evidence, and he remarks that the value of the report must be, to that extent, impaired. On the 25th February, 1935, his colleagues signed the following direction : - </para>

          <para class="block">Incidentally, we have to thank the former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> for having had that section inserted in the act, despite our strong protests at the time. On this point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> comments -  lt was obvious that it was not the intention of the legislature that all the individual accounts of the companies should be concealed, otherwise the legislature would have said so. </para>
          <para class="block">That statement calls for serious thought on the part of honorable members, and indicates that legislation of this character provided an opportunity - in this case, grasped by Messrs. Gunn and Hancock - to avoid disclosing the exact profits of these companies. They contended that the Attorney-General of  the day then  declared  that  in no case should any of the profits be disclosed ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> claimed  that  if  the  legislature had been of the opinion that no disclosure of profits should be made, it would have definitely said so. When the commission was appointed, the oil-and-petrol question was prominently in the minds of the public, and great interest was being  shown in it by the  primary producers because of the large quantity, of oil and petrol used  by  them on .the farms. This ouse was unanimous as to the necessity for an inquiry, and considered that the terms of reference should be so drawn up that when the report was furnished  the  public would be informed precisely as to the part this combine  was  playing  in  the direction of maintaining the high price of petrol  and  oil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> further stated - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>With regard to profits, it seems to me that the profits are either reasonable or unreasonable. If they are reasonable, there could not be any prejudice to the company as the result of their publication. If they are unreasonable, I cannot see that it would be unfair to publish them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a plain way of putting the  view that  would be expressed by the average person who is interested in this combine. If its profits are reasonable, <inline font-style="italic">why</inline> should we not be put in possession of that information ? Most people realize and accept the view that these companies do not trade for philanthropic purposes - that they expect a reasonable return on their outlay. But  if  their profits are unreasonable, the public is entitled to know all about them. In the following sentence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> virtually sounds .the death-knell of inquiries by royal commissions, and admits the failure of Parliament to grapple with combines. On page  24  of his summary, he Bays - </para>

            <para>I do not think that satisfactory information can be furnished on the matters on which we have to make inquiry and report,  without  disclosing the extent of the total trade, the capital employed and the profits made by these companies which dominate the trade. If these matters be not stated in the report, the value of the report must, in my opinion, be to that extent impaired. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Once again vested interests have been able to dominate the affairs of this country. In effect, these interests nullify the power which the Parliament is alleged to possess. It is represented to the people that their welfare arid interests are safeguarded by the legislation passed from time to time; but this report discloses that the oil interests can exploit the community, and the Parliament is impotent. The instruments set up by the Parliament have apparently been tampered with, and what amounts to' a " white-washing " report of some  200  pages of  150,000  words, costing thousands of pounds, is so much waste paper. Only one recommendation of any note has been made. This is by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb,</inline> who, on page  22  of his summary, suggests that  all  companies acting simply as marketing organizations for overseas companies should be taxed on a percentage of their total receipts. Obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> made that recommendation because he was unable to probe to the bottom, and obtain the correct profits of these companies. The profits remain hidden, cloaked by the interlocking of the Australian organization with overseas groups. </para>
          <para>The reports have camouflaged what this Parliament desired to be brought to the surface. Mention is made here and there of combines. A document known as the "White products policy" is commented upon, and it is stated that at least three companies adhere to it. It is also mentioned that a combine of the companies was formed to devise suitable or expedient action by all. But no measures have been brought before the Parliament for the purpose of bringing these combines to heel. It is  a  waste of money to add to the already extravagant cost of the commission the expense of having the report printed, in view of its utter failure  to submit practical recommendations on which the Parliament could act. Evidently, in the future, Parliament must undertake these inquiries itself; it cannot shirk that duty much longer. </para>
          <para>I notice that, following the publication of the commission's report, the general manager of the Shell Company stated that he refused to accept the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> with reference to the " White products policy ". He declared that these organizations did not adopt the practice alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb.</inline> Only a week ago, I brought under the notice of honorable members the case of a garage proprietor in the Liverpool district, in which the Shell and Vacuum Oil Companies had definitely refused to supply petrol and oil to him. He had installed a pump to enable him to supply the petrol distributed by another company. It was not a case in which the proprietor was setting up in business for the first time, for he had been carrying on operations in that locality for a lengthy period. He merely vacated premises in a back street, and established a bigger garage and repairing plant in a more prominent position. He had been handling the products of the Shell and Vacuum Oil Companies for a number of years. He added other pumps for the purpose of retailing Purr-pull and other brands of petrol, and although he was prepared to pay cash for his supplies, and had installed extra pumps at his own cost, the combine withdrew the ordinary supplies which he had been purchasing for years, and refused to sell him any of its products. In the face of this the manager of the company in Melbourne, in discussing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb's</inline> report, regarding white as against black products, has had the brazen effrontery to declare in the press that he refuses to accept the declaration of the Commissioner, and that he and his company are willing to allow all who are prepared to pay for its products to handle them effectively just as they would handle those of any other company. </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly it is. Yet no definite lead was given by the commission from which action could be taken, and particularly was this so in the case of the majority report. I appeal to the House to consider quite dispassionately the reports that have been made. Despite the terms of reference the majority report gives no lead to the Parliament. Australia has spent at least ?12,000 on this commission only to be informed by these gentlemen that it must continue to be exploited. I think that, regardless of the districts from which we come, we shall all agree that the people whom we represent are being exploited by the major oil companies, and I should like to see a combined effort on the part of the whole Parliament to use every means in its power to grapple with these companies. We should deal with this oil trust in such a way as to afford an object lesson to others who also may be exploiting the public. We have not had an opportunity to get at the others; but once we set out to formulate a definite plan of action we shall find a way to deal with all of them. Not  only must the people of Australia be exploited- according to the majority report - but any effort by individuals to break the grip of the combine has been ruthlessly broken down. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb</inline> reported- </para>

          <para>I have no doubt that the lowering of prices waa done designedly to put a stop to competition from companies which were selling sundry petrols "... Prices were dropped to very low levels to dispose of competition and afterwards prices were raised. </para>
          <para class="block">We are all well aware of these facts. "When the smaller companies with little capital and restricted means of distribution sought  to  compete with the combine the major companies proceeded to cut prices. Distribution of petrol supplies m Australia, with its magnificent distances, is &amp; big problem. The companies in the combine, having worked their way in and perfected a system  of  distribution, lowered prices to such an extent as to break down competition, realizing that, even if they were out  of  pocket by doing so, any loss would soon be made good once they had run their competitors off the market. Having cut them out, they immediately, as the  chairman of  the commission points out, lifted prices. </para>

          <para>I have brought before this House glaring cases  of  restraint of trade and absolute victimization. Those cases should not be allowed to continue, yet the commissioners, in effect, have given their blessing to this despicable business by a recommendation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb,</inline> which means nothing at all, and by silence on the part of his two colleagues. In one instance, at least, the commission amply justifies the statements </para>

          <para>In various sections of the reports, admissions are made that the commissioners have failed to grapple with the matter, and have not reported fully in the terms of reference laid down.  It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment to the motion that the report be printed. </para>
          <para>We should, as a Parliament, say that we do not approve of the report, that we are of the opinion that it does not disclose. as we expected it would do, the ramifications of these companies. The commissioners have not confined themselves within the terms of reference, and we should say that we are not going to allow money to be frittered away on the printing of a useless report. There should be no opposition to my amendment. I hope that the House will unanimously agree to it. I do not suppose that honorable members would be prepared at this moment to consider the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee; but failing that, we should at once send back the report to the men whom we appointed as commissioners to inquire into the whole matters, and remind them of their responsibilities. Parliament should declare in no uncertain way its hostility to the report. The press generally has expressed its views of the majority report in langauge almost similar to that which I have used to-day, and we may be sure that the action which I propose would commend itself to the people generally. I am confident that the public would be behind us in any effort we might make to run this combine to earth. By united action to this end we may secure some satisfaction. </para>

            <para>.- The report of the Petrol Commission, which forms the basis of the  amendment moved by the honorable member for "West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> is, as he has rightly said, a voluminous document, the careful study of which would entail more time than has been available to the Government in recent weeks. The Government has taken what action has been necessary and possible within the limited time at its disposal, and has referred to the appropriate authorities those sections of the report which contain criticisms and adverse views; those dealing with taxation matters have been referred to the Commonwealth .Commissioner of Taxation, those dealing with possible restraint of trade have been referred to the Attorney-General's Department, while numerous other matters. particularly that of country differential in the price of petrol and oils, have been referred to the State governments. Honorable members may rest assured that the whole report will be adequately considered by the Government within the next few months. My principal reason for speaking on this matter is to reply to the statements made by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> with regard to evidence taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> I assure the honorable member that it was within the power of the royal commission to take evidence in whatever manner it pleased, either in private or public; but once having accepted <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> certain evidence, such as that relating to total cost figures and accounts, it had no option but to regard it as confidential if the majority of the commission so decided, and to exclude from its report any figures based on that evidence. I am not, on behalf of the Government, either defending or attacking the oil companies or the royal commission. The royal commission may have had very good reasons for hearing certain evidence in private, but under a section of the Royal Commissions Act it is not permitted to disclose evidence taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> I hold no brief for the oil companies, but I say this, at least, in their defence: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing,</inline> the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation, as every one knows, has certain difficulties in determining rates of tax to be imposed on oil companies in order that they may bear their just share of taxation. The oil companies were asked if they would be agreeable to the whole of the evidence taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> being made available to him - that is, all the figures relating to costs, profits, and accounts. All the companies agreed to this request, and the commissioner is now taking steps to obtain all of that evidence, and when it is obtained he will be in possession of a. great deal more information in regard to the operation of these companies than he has had in the past. Upon that information he will no doubt base his decision as to whether or not to apply a section of the act which enables him to put an arbitrary percentage on the total turnover as a basis for his assessment of tax. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For the reasons which I have given it is not possible for the Government to reply in detail to the remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney. When the report has been fully considered and the Government has received reports from the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Taxation, and the State governments, it will then be able to decide whether or not it is necessary in the public interest to go further in this matter, and whether it is necessary to appoint another royal commission or extend the life of the present one. </para>

            <para>.- On behalf of the Opposition I desire to register an emphatic protest against the methods adopted by the Government in the conduct of the business of this Parliament during the past week, in the hope that in future more courteous consideration will be extended to honorable members on this side of the House. While the Opposition does not comprise the majority of members of this House, it represents a greater number of the people of Australia. The results of the last election disclose that the combined votes ofl candidates representing the United Australia party and the United Country party totalled 1,766,000 as against a total of 1,779,000 votes polled by opposing parties. This clearly shows, as I have said, that honorable members on this side of the House actually represent a greater number of Australian people than do members sitting behind the Government, lt is true, however, that, in this House the United Australia party and the United Country party combined have a majority of members. Any government that callously disregards the rights of the Opposition deserves everything that results from its discourtesy. A  litle  tact, good judgment and consideration for the views of the Opposition result in facilitating the passage of the  business  of Parliament. Within the last two days a Supply Bill, covering the expenditure of over £6,000,000, was bludgeoned through  this  House through the agency of the gag. Despite the fact that there was no organized obstruction by honorable members on this side of the House, the gag was ruthlessly applied and discussion was stifled. In endeavouring to speak to that bill honorable members were merely using their rights; when their rights were denied them they made use of the forms of the House to register their protest. </para>

              <para>- Seven months have elapsed since the election, and now, after only 38 sitting days, the Government proposes that Parliament shall go into recess for about five months. There is no necessity to force honorable members to sit up all night in order to rush legislation through this House. Yesterday after I, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, had been speaking for less than ten minutes on a bill to validate certain duties of . customs, the " gag " was applied. It is true that, later, I had another opportunity to speak, but on that oCcasIon also I was " gagged ". Surely the Acting Leader of the Opposition is entitled to greater courtesy! Like other honorable members, I had suggestions and amendments to place before the committee, but discussion was stifled by the application of the "gag". The Government has only itself to blame for the humiliation to which it was subjected in that the business of the House was taken out of its hands. On behalf of the Opposition, I emphatically protest against the callous disregard to its rights, and 1 warn the Government that if it. again attempts to conduct the business of the House along similar lines, it will find the opposition much stronger. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Government, for consideration during the recess, the desirability of appointing a representative of Western Australia to the Broadcasting Commission when appointments to that body are made about June next. The Perth Chamber of Commerce and other representative bodies in that State urge that that be done. The present five members of the commission are drawn from the eastern and more populous States. In my opinion, the outlying States are entitled to representation on this body. The emoluments of members of the commission are not high : but I am confident that a satisfactory nominee could be found in Western Australia. Commissioners resident in Melbourne and Sydney cannot be expected to have personal knowledge of the conditions which. exist in the far-flung parts of Australia, and, therefore, I urge the appointment of a representative of Western Australia. I submit this recommendation now so that it may be considered before the time arrives to make the appointments. </para>

We refused leave as a protest against the proposed long recess. Australia is passing through the most critical period of its history and we believe that at such a time Parliament should not remain in recess for a lengthy period. Surely the Government does not believe that the members of the Cabinet have a monopoly of the brains of this Parliament. In any case, the views of the electors cannot be adequately represented if Parliament is in recess. Their representatives should be given the opportunity to assist in modelling the future policy of this country. It is not right that such important matters as trade treaties and agreements, which will vitally 'affect the welfare of the people of this country, should be entered into without Parliament having been consulted. </para>

            <para>E. - On the 8th instant the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Donald Cameron)</inline> asked me, without notice, whether I had seen a certain circular relating to the policy of the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the sugar industry. I have read this document, and find that its criticisms of the Government's sugar policy are couched in most intemperate and extravagant language. This is not surprising in connexion with a protected industry, when it is known that the circulars are tha joint production of the Henry George League and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gates,</inline> who signs himself secretary of the Sugar Consumers' Association, and who for years was secretary of the Town and Country Union, another freetrade organization. These organizations are circularizing every municipality in Victoria, and stating that the people are being robbed. This criticism has not impressed the Shepparton Council, the  chairman  of which, who is the secretary of the Shepparton canneries, has stated that the circular is an insult to the council's intelligence. A similar view has been expressed by the Northcote Council. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The statements contain so many exaggerations and mis-statements of fact that they defeat themselves as a criticism. </para>
          <para class="block">The principal fallacy is the statement that the people of Victoria are being robbed of ?2,000,000 per annum, which is equivalent to ?S,000;000 per annum for the Commonwealth. At the recent annual conference of the Australian Institute of Political Science, Professor Giblin, who admittedly is an authority on the subject, stated that the cost to the Commonwealth was ?5,100,000 per annum, and even this amount is based on a theoretical world's parity price, which is the lowest in history, operates in only two overseas countries, and could not apply to Australia, because it is calculated on the cheapest coloured labour rates, and has caused a collapse in the industry in Java itself. </para>
          <para>The last committee of inquiry in 1931, which included representatives of the industry, the Housewives Association, manufacturers and fruit-growers, unanimously supported the extension of the embargo system for a further five years. That system operates for the protection of this industry, which is not subsidized. </para>
          <para>It is noted that the circular of the Sugar Consumers' Association practically confines its references to the recent debate in this House, by quoting speeches delivered by members of the Labour party- of New South Wales. </para>

            <para>E. - The company has said that, if the refining were done free of charge, that would not make a difference of more than one-twelfth of a penny per lb. in the price of sugar. Obviously, such an amount could not be passed on. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In conclusion, I would point out that all that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> did, before leaving for the United Kingdom, was to declare the intention of the Government of the Commonwealth to enter into another sugar agreement with the Queensland Government. That agreement will be submitted to Parliament in due course for its approval or otherwise. This fact has been repeatedly made clear. Those who are opposed to the Government's sugar policy will have an ample opportunity in the next period of the session to state their case. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Harry Chauvel and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, two of the most distinguished leaders of the Australian Imperial Forces? Is the report correct that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White first learned of his exclusion from a press paragraph? </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHDALE</inline>PARKHILL. - Since I have been Minister for Defence the only member of the Council of Defence, apart from the ministerial members, has been <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White. I understand that the members of the first Council of Defence were nominated by the Minister for Defence, but were not referred to by name. In any case, there has been no meeting of the council since 1929. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel, as head of one of the arms of the service, was previously a member of it. He left the council when he retired from the forces. Another member was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash. These are the facts as shown by the records which I have with me. </para>
          <para>When the Council of Defence was reconstructed a few days ago, the proposal was that it should consist of the members whom I have indicated, but that any distinguished officers by whom the  council thought valuable advice and assistance could be given could be co-opted at any time. I have already written to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, inviting him to act on the council in an advisory capacity in accordance with the new constitution. I also thanked him warmly on behalf of the Government for his past services. Unfortunately, the statement handed out to the evening press was published before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> could get my letter. Had I kept the statement back for the morning newspapers, he would have received, simultaneously with the  pres3  announcement, the letter conveying the sentiments of the Government, expressing its great thanks to him, and asking him to act in an advisory capacity on the council whenever his services were required. Nobody has greater admiration than I have for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, and the other leaders of the Australian Imperial Forces. I have already consulted him and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel on matters affecting the Defence Department since I have been in office, and I propose to continue that policy. Ministers will be exceedingly glad to avail themselves of their advice  on every possible occasion. All that we have done is to widen the field from which advice may be obtained. I repeat that the Government appreciates to the fullest extent the assistance that it has had from these distinguished leaders, and proposes to seek their advice whenever possible. </para>

The reply I gave recently to a question asked in this chamber was to the effect that no particular occupations were banned in respect of blind pensioners or blind applicants for the pension, except that pensions were not usually given to Mind applicants who solicited  alms and depended on that practice for a living. I also explained that there were certain occupations which could be carried on in such a way as to amount virtually to soliciting alms, and that this also constituted a bar to the receipt of the pension. Any article whatever, even matches and tea, could be sold in such a way that it would amount, in effect, to the soliciting of alms. I can assure the honorable member that the position is exactly as I have stated it, but if he has received a communication to a contrary effect, I shall be glad to consider it. </para>

              <para>- If the personnel were what it should be, I do not think that that would be the result. The whole of life is evolutionary, and the financial system should progress along evolutionary lines. But the radical thought that has been so prominent in political circles during the last few years has acted as a deterrent to evolution with respect to this particular matter. The increasing strength of this radical thought has placed vested interests so much upon the defensive that they have been utterly stagnant in relation to any endeavour to improve this system, with the result that no progress has been made. I should say that radical proposals have engendered such a defensive habit of mind that there is no hope of evolution through political channels. Initiative has been curbed and does not provide a lead, and influence is exercised only in order to put restraint upon those who would exhibit enterprise. The inert power of resistance of nervous or selfish vested interests, and the mediums of propaganda which they control, have prevented a mandate from being received by those who have sufficient enterprise to act. We should explore every avenue of the system. </para>

          <para>I suggest that we should investigate the question whether our national bank is acting on sufficiently competitive lines. I direct attention to the first Commonwealth Bank Act, passed in 1911, which sets out the purposes to be served by the nation's bank. The intention of the Parliament that founded that institution was that it should carry on the general business of banking; and no later Parliament has expressed a contrary intention. The policy of the Bank Board, however, either with or without the concurrence of the Government, has been to refrain from full and normal competition with the trading banks. Of course, since its establishment the Commonwealth Bank has become a central bank for Australia. Most central banking authorities have thought it desirable that central banks should refrain from entering into active competition with the trading banks which they serve. But that has not always been the case. The Bank of Italy, which is the central bank of that country, trades on a fully competitive basis with the other trading banks which it serves. </para>
          <para>The daily overdraft rates of the Commonwealth Bank, by comparison with those of the trading banks, show that lower interest rates are provided by the bank established by the nation. If that bank were trading in full competition, we should not see that considerable discrepancy in the overdraft rates; the full competition of the Commonwealth Bank would result in lower interest rates all round, by bringing the trading banks into line with the bank of the nation. This Parliament should not set up a bank for the nation which gives certain of our citizens a better service than they are able to secure elsewhere, and restricts that service to a limited number. If the nation is to establish a bank which is to confer certain advantages, they should be offered to all who are entitled to them; they should not be restricted to a fortunate few. The present practice must impair the efficiency of the trading banks by taking from them the pick of the &gt; business. If the Commonwealth Bank traded in a fully competitive manner, we should see no such discrepancy as is observed to-day in the overdraft interest rates that prevail. There should be a comprehensive inquiry into this aspect of the matter, and a recommendation as to whether the Commonwealth Bank should trade in full competition, or refrain from engaging at all in the business of private banking, so that the people may know just where they stand. To-day too many suspect that it deliberately refrains from trading in full competition because of the influence of vested interests. Personally I do not believe that, but only an inquiry by an independent tribunal would clear up that point in the minds of a large section of the public. It might be found to be entirely desirable that the nation's bank should refrain altogether from trading in competition with private banks. </para>
          <para>Regarding the second portion of my motion, I suggest that it may be desirable for the Commonwealth Bank Board to confer with the Treasurer when determining the exchange rate of Australian currency. Professor Brigden in his work on <inline font-style="italic">Purchasing Power and the Pound Australian,</inline> has said this - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The rates of exchange broke away from the control of the banks in January, 1931, and are now compensating the exporters for the unduly low rate in 1930, <inline font-style="italic">pegged m the interests chiefly of governments.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para>Notwithstanding this statement that the trading banks themselves pegged the exchange rate in the interests of governments, we are told that this matter of exchange should not in any respect be regarded as coming within the province of government policy. I believe that the close relationship which the exchange rate has with the prices of our export commodities when sold in Australia, and its influence upon the whole of our economic life, are such that it should bc regarded as coming within the province of government policy. I do not -suggest that it should become a matter for the determination of Parliament. But the Government of the day should through the Treasurer be formally consulted by the Commonwealth Bank Board when it is determining the policy to be followed  in fixing the weekly exchange rate of this nation's currency in relation to sterling. It has been found imprudent to allow the exchange rate to fluctuate from day to day, because of the effects that these variations have on the business of both private persons and governments. Governments necessarily require, for budgetary purposes, to be able to estimate what the effect of the exchange is going to be upon their commitments. Exchange in our country, like that of every other country, is now managed to a certain extent, and I suggest that the Government of the day, through the Treasurer, should formally confer with the Commonwealth Bank when the policy to be observed in managing our exchange rate is under consideration. </para>
          <para>I regret that my time is now almost expired, and that the House is about to adjourn. From what I have said and would have said, if time had permitted, I deduce that the legislature should, after ample inquiry, and when fully informed, decide the banking and currency functions which should be controlled by the nation through its proper authority, and those which might properly be left to private institutions conducting their operations for profit. There is urgent necessity for a comprehensive inquiry by a royal commission to report upon the merits and shortcomings of our existing system. The report should also cover the banking functions which should be performed and controlled by the nation's bank, and should state whether the Government should participate in the determination of the Bank Board's exchange  policy. We need the report of some authority free from political influence as to what functions ought properly to he left to the control of the private banking institutions. The commission should also report upon the- advisability of the Commonwealth Bank either entering into fuller competition with the trading banks or refraining entirely from competition. </para>

          <para>That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that constitutional alterations he provided to permit of the organization of primary producers on an Australian basis, with complete sectional control of internal and external marketing of each primary product, such control to be exercised exclusively by the organized producers of such commodity enabling  them  to speak with one voice and authority in regard to any arrangement which may be deemed by them to be necessary to conserve their interests. </para>

        <para class="block">Among all sections of our pastoralists, our dairymen, our agriculturists and our fruit-growers to-day, the great necessity for some alteration of their conditions in order that they may secure a greater return for their labours is recognized. Unfortunately, in the past, governments, both State and Commonwealth, have found it impossible to deal with their requirements because of constitutional difficulties. The proposal which I have placed before this House in this motion would, if adopted, be of great value to the primary producers of this country, and would afford them a  greater  measure of assistance than could be proposed in any stabilization legislation or relief bill providing millions of pounds for assistance to primary producers. To-day, more than ever before, all nations depend on the success of their primary producers, but successful primary production depends upon the provision of suitable markets. The newspapers of the world  contain  accounts of the tariff walls which all countries are erecting against outside competition. Embargoes on imports are imposed and trade treaties with other nations arranged in  an  attempt to expand their trade. Recent happenings in the Old Country emphasize the importance of its primary industries, and the part they play in the welfare of the community. The primary producers of Australia are unable to secure the advantages which their fellow producers in other countries enjoy, largely because of the limitations imposed on this Parliament by the Constitution. The division  of  power between the States  and  the Commonwealth prevents  the  primary producers from organizing to expand their oversea trade. Under  the  Constitution, as drawn, the States are free to market their products anywhere within Australia whilst the Commonwealth has control  of  the export trade. No authority  is  given sufficient power to enable  it  to organize the marketing of primary products in a general way. The efforts of this Parliament, and of the producers themselves, to obtain that power, have been frustrated by the Constitution. I do not ask for  a  wholesale amendment of the Constitution, or even that the whole of section 51  be  altered. I ask only that section  51 and section 92 be amended sufficiently to enable our primary industries to be organized on an Australian basis. I wish not to injure the Constitution, but rather to widen its scope. Unfortunately, its framers took the constitution of the United States of America, which is the narrowest in the world, as a basis. Canada and other countries are not hampered by the restrictions which the Australian Constitution imposes on the primary producers of this country. Britain is free to grant assistance to its industries, and to negotiate with other powers, as well as with the dominions, in the interests of its own primary producers. Australia is not in that happy position, because of the powers vested in the States. I urge that the primary producers of this country be put on a level with the producers of other countries. I do not underestimate the strength of the forces against the primary producers. Vested interests will oppose any alteration of the Constitution which would interfere with their privileges; but the producers of Australia should be sufficiently powerful to force the State parliaments to pass measures similar to that which, I trust, will be introduced into this Parliament if this motion is agreed to. </para>
        <para>The Constitution provides for its amendment. Those who seek to amend it, as I am doing to-day, are not its enemies, but its best friends, for, until it is altered, dissatisfaction must continue. The producers of this country believed that, under federation, they would have a free hand to market their products; but, instead, the Constitution has given rise to chaotic conditions. In the early days of the federation there was no need to alter the Constitution; but conditions have changed so greatly during the 35 years that have passed since this Parliament began its work that an amendment is urgently necessary. Matters which 3f&gt; years ago were properly the concern of the States are now the concern of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>Of all the primary producers in Australia the dairymen have been most successful in bringing about uniformity of control. That is due largely to the adoption of a co-operative system of working. The producers ' of dairy pro ducts have Commonwealth-wide control to some extent; but that control is not equal to what it would be if they were working under a constitution which gave to them the power sought by this motion. T ask that the primary producers in each industry be given control of their own products. Can better evidence of chaotic conditions be found than those which exist in the wheat-growing industry? Year after year Parliament is asked to vote millions of pounds to keep the wheatgrowers on their farms. Yet their position is -now no better than it was. All that is desired could be obtained by the introduction of a simple bill empowering the primary producers in each industry to deal with their own products. By an alteration of the Constitution in the way that I have suggested the wheat-growers of this country would be able to bring about a home price for wheat, erect silos, and market their products as they liked. There is urgent need to bring each primary industry under one Commonwealthwide control, and to gather data relating to its value and the possibilities of its development. An agricultural bureau controlled by direct representatives of the primary producers would be of great value to our principal exporting industries. The Commonwealth Council of Agriculture, to which the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has often referred recently, will be of no real value to the producers, because it will be under the control of the political leaders of the Commonwealth and the States, and not the producers. The producers must be allowed to control their own destiny if the Commonwealth is to make the progress of which it is capable in agriculture. A slight alteration of section 51 of the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over interstate, intra-state and overseas trade would be of immense value to the whole nation, as well as to the producing interests. Constitutional power of this kind is possessed by the Parliaments of other countries of the world, and it is essential to the welfare of our community that this Parliament shall possess it. Under existing conditions the producers have no control over their products, except in their own State. The present  division of power over trade and commerce has developed a completely unsatisfactory state of affairs. The authorities which possess certain power over trade are not able to exercise it effectively, and the authority which could exercise it effectively, this Parliament, does not possess it. The primary producers of the various States have endeavoured to organize their industries, but have not been able to achieve the success desired because of the limitation of the power of this Parliament. The primary producers of Queensland built up a strong State organization and stabilized marketing within the State, but, unfortunately, the producers of other States were able to rob them of the fruits of their work and frustrate all their efforts to improve the position of their industries. </para>
        <para>I am supported in these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution by the Graziers Association of Queensland, the Council of Agriculture of Queensland, and many other organizations. The Federated Wheat-growers of Australia recently resolved to request that steps be taken to establish an Australian marketing control board; but effective action along that line cannot be taken by the Commonwealth until the Constitution is amended. We know very well that the Australian pork producers, fat lamb oroducers, banana-growers, and citrus-growers, have all, at various times, expressed a desire for an Australia-wide marketing organization, and so have the maize-growers of Queensland. At Murwillumbah recently, the banana-growers came to the conclusion that only an Australiawide organization could ensure effective work being done. For the last seven or eight years the Country party has had a plank on its platform relating to the extension of the constitutional power of this Parliament, and it is time that steps were taken to give effect to it. The Prime Minister did me the courtesy to bring under the notice of the constitutional conference some time ago the very matter that I am now discussing, but, unfortunately, no agreement was reached. State boards of control can exercise considerable power over marketing in their own State, but are helpless to deal with interstate trade. * </para>
        <para>The primary producers of Australia voted in favour of federation because they believed that the power over trade proposed to be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament would allow the nation-wide marketing of products to be developed; but the framers of the Constitution must have realized that the power to be given to the Commonwealth Parliament was strictly limited. I want the House to signify that it agrees with the constitution alteration proposed in my motion. It is only a small alteration, although it would have a wide application. It deals only with a concession to the primary producers who, as generally recognized, have been hit harder than any other section of the community by the economic adversity of recent years. To-day we are granting to the primary producers millions of pounds in the form of grants to assist the wheat industry and under a scheme of debt adjustment. There would be no necessity for the Government to extend such assistance if my motion were agreed to, because the primary producers would then be enabled to finance their own industry. The adjustments which would be made possible under my proposal would enable them to secure greater returns for their produce. This, in turn, would greatly benefit not only the community generally, but also the finances of our governments. I suggest that this House should give its sanction to the passage of legislation for a constitution alteration that would make possible the formation of an Australia-wide organization, which it was originally expected the primary producers would have under the unity proposals put forward when federation was brought about. To-day this Parliament has not the power to permit the formation of such an organization. It can extend its influence overseas but must permit the interests of the primary producers of this country to be subordinated to the demands of mercantile and financial interests which always have their own ends to serve. I ask that the primary producers be given complete control externally and internally over their industries to enable them to bring about price adjustments and marketing arrangements, generally, throughout the whole of Australia. This proposal would.  enable the producers to exercise exclusive control over their respective industries. I claim that a greater benefit could not be conferred upon primary producers, as a whole, than by giving them such control. Undoubtedly the producers arc best able to look after their own interests. Thus we should give them a direct voice in the making of any arrangements which affect their interests such as the organization generally of their industry, finance, the establishment of pools, the erection of silos, matters affecting exports, the chartering of ships for the conveyance of produce overseas, and the opening up of new markets. We should also allow them to arrange trade treaties with other countries for the marketing of their respective commodities, because no government can do this work as effectively as the producers themselves. I have very great pleasure in submitting this motion to the House and hope it will be carried. </para>

          <para>.- The time at my disposal will not permit me to deal with this matter as fully as I would wish. It is a very important matter. The House would require a whole week, probably, to debate properly the motions standing on the notice paper in the names of private members, and it is regrettable that these matters have to be dealt with in the last half-hour of the session. The second motion on the notice-paper, which stands in the name of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> deals with the very important matter of banking and monetary reform.

        <para>The motion now before the House is one that certainly can be supported by members of the Labour party. It proposes an alteration of the Constitution to permit of the organization of primary producers on an Australia-wide basis. In Queensland a Labour government has put into operation a policy along these lines. It has organized primary industries on a State-wide basis, producers being given representation through district councils and commodity boards on a State council of agriculture. Such a scheme to be really effective should be Australian-wide. The Federal Labour party's policy in this respect reads - </para>

        <para class="block">I do not advocate the institution of an inquiry that might be used as the basis of an attack on the banking institutions, nor do I wish to loose a tirade against the monetary and banking systems that obtain to-day. There is, however, a doubt in the minds of an overwhelming majority of the electors of this country as to whether our banking and monetary systems have kept pace with our social evolution and industrial progress. It is necessary that an inquiry should be conducted by the very best brains available, by people who are uninfluenced by any pre-conceived desire to nationalize everything, but yet are  free from any  undue reluctance to interfere  with  institutions which have demonstrated their ability to influence government policy, and to direct the whole course of our economic life. There is not one of us who is not aghast at a condition of affairs, in which production, increased beyond the dreams of our forefathers, exists side by side with dire want, many of our people, even the very people who are producing in such abundance, are ill-fed and ill-clad. Faced with this progressive efficiency of production, ourfirst thought turns to a reduction  of  working hours. But as  that would  have such an adverse effect on the costs of production of our exporting industries we are forced to dismiss it as an immediate solution of our problems. It is wrong that maximum efficiency of production should coincide with minimum purchasing power of our people. Any economic system which prevents us from achieving the greatest measure of industrial progress is detrimental to our social welfare. Many trained thinkers claim that our banking system, as it exists to-day, is either wholly or partly responsible for our present condition. Some believe that the system is fundamentally wrong, while others maintain that it has merely lagged behind our industrial progress. If it is wrong, the sooner we establish the right system, or improve the existing one, the better for us all. If, however, it is proved that the existing banking and financial system is not in any respect responsible for the prevailing wide-spread want and unemployment, that fact should be established, so that we may relieve our banking institutions from the suspicion under which they now rest in the minds of so many people. We want to achieve the very best system possible, and as any banking system must depend for its efficiency on that intangible quantity, public confidence, the sooner the doubts of the people are set at rest the better. This problem cannot be solved by a decision of politicians ; it must be investigated by trained experts in whom every one has confidence, and then we must accept their recommendations. We should not have been justified in our request for the appointment of a royal commis-  sion to investigate this matter had not such a large proportion of the electors indicated a desire for some radical change in our financial and banking system, or at least for an inquiry into that system. Something like 1,800,000 electors at the last federal elections voted for candidates who sponsored a radical alteration of the existing system, while another 500,000 who supported the United Country party voted in favour of its policy for a comprehensive inquiry into it. That is the first reason which I give in support of this request for a royal commission. Secondly, I refer to the many expressions of doubt that have been voiced by persons whom we regard as financial and economic experts, as to whether the system is all that it should be. Those persons include <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Basil</inline> Blackett, a director of the Bank of England and an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer of India, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> McKenna,  chairman  of the Midland Bank, the greatest private banking institution in the British Empire. In addition, men in the commercial field, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Ford, and statesmen of the eminence of Franklin Roosevelt entertain grave doubts regarding the efficiency of the existing system. This is sufficient of itself to justify the request for a complete investigation and overhaul of the system. For a generation, trained thinkers of the calibre of Professor Irving Fisher, of the Tale University, in the United States of America, have striven to impress upon the world the increasing inadequacy of the system. Surely, in the face of this weight of authoritative dissatisfaction, this National Parliament should decide to authorize a thorough investigation! </para>
