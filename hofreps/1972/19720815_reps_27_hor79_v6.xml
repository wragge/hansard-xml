          <para>- It is with very deep regret that I have to inform the House of the death on 7th July of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon, a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, at the age of 86. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon was without doubt one of the truly great Australians of his time.  His  reputation as an outstanding jurist was acknowledged both in Australia and overseas, particularly in Britain and the United States.  His  contributions extended far beyond the legal field. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was born at Hawthorn in Victoria on 28th April 1886 and was educated at Hawthorn College and at the University of Melbourne where he took degrees in Arts and Law. He was called to the Victorian Bar in 1910 and in 1922, at the age of 36, became a Kings Counsel. Within the next 2 years he was twice to appear in London before the Privy Council, an unusual event for Australian lawyers in those days, and nearly 3 decades before he himself was to be appointed a member of that Council. In 1926 he became Acting Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria and in 1929 was appointed a Justice of the High Court. He was Chief Justice of the High Court from 1952 until his retirement in 1964. </para>
        <para>When called upon in times of crisis <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon served with equally great distinction in other spheres. In 1940, at the request of the Menzies Government, he undertook the chairmanship of the Central Wool Committee, which had been set up to administer the wartime handling of the wool clip. During the following 2 years he became  Chairman  of the Australian Shipping Control Board, the Marine Risks Insurance Board, the Commonwealth </para>
        <para class="block">Marine Salvage Board and the Allied Consultative Shipping Council in Australia. In 1942 he was appointed by the Curtin Government as Australian Minister to the United States and remained in that important post until he resumed his seat on the Bench in 1944. In 1950 he was appointed by the United Nations as mediator in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  His  tireless efforts to bring an end to that unhappy conflict were not to succeed but it was widely recognised that he had done as much as any man could possibly have done in those most difficult circumstances. </para>
        <para>In 1963 he was awarded the Order of Merit by  Her  Majesty the Queen - a rare distinction and one bestowed only on the personal initiative of the Sovereign. He also was a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. He held honorary law doctorates from Oxford and Harvard. It is, nonetheless, as an outstanding man of the law that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon will be remembered.  His  immense scholarship, his qualities of mind and his unfailing personal dignity set him out among his fellows wherever he moved. He commanded respect in every field of human endeavour to which his talents were called and he was held in deep affection by all who knew him. Australia has indeed lost a great man. This country is richer for the life of Owen Dixon. We salute his memory and we send our deepest sympathy to his family. </para>

As counsel, as judge, as wartime administrator, as diplomatist and as Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon touched nothing that he did not adorn. Australians must be grateful for his services to his fellow citizens.

          <para>- I would like to associate the Australian Country Party with the condolences expressed and tributes paid by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon; As both gentlemen have said, he was a truly outstanding Australian who won enormous respect both in this country and overseas. He had a long and varied career, reaching its zenith as Chief Justice of Australia. But he was also a great diplomat and as such he was required to show his great knowledge in helping with certain United Nations activities. I note with interest that he was also  chairman  of a committee that dealt with the handling of the Australian wool clip during the Second World War. This was an enormous undertaking but he carried it out with great skill. He was an outstanding and brilliant Australian and we honour him in this House today. </para>

From 1929 until the beginning of 1932 he was Minister for Home Affairs in the .Scullin Government. In 1928 and 1929 he was  Deputy  Leader of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Blakeley</inline> was born in Gilberton in South Australia in 1886 and was educated at the North Broken Hill convent school. He held several important posts in the Australian Workers Union and was its General  President  from 1919 to 1923. Following his defeat in the 1934 election he took an appointment as a Commonwealth arbitration inspector, and for the last 10 years before his retirement in 1952 was a Commonwealth conciliation commissioner. We extend our sympathy to his family in their loss. </para>

        <para class="block">Leader of our Party. As legislator, administrator and arbitrator he served the Australian people for many years and with great devotion and distinction. May I be pardoned a personal reminiscence about him. He was the first Federal Minister whom I met. He built his own house in Canberra in 1929 and lived here until he was defeated as a member of Parliament. I went to Telopea Park school with one of his daughters and one of his sons. I have retained my associations with the family. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Blakeley,</inline> not only by injunction but also by example, helped to make Canberra the beautiful city that it is. He was the first distinguished person who brought to my notice as a school child the fact that it was immoral, and in Canberra illegal, to chop down trees. He helped to make this city a better place in which to live. I believe that members of the Australian Labor Party, members of his old union and members of his old electorate will still remember with admiration and affection his services to them. </para>

          <para>- I would like to associate the Australian Country Party with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Unfortunately 1 cannot speak about the Honourable Arthur Blakeley personally; he was before my time. It is sad that it has to be an occasion like this when we are reminded of the services that other people have made to this Parliament. He was a very important person in this House. He was the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party during a very tense period for this nation. He was a member of this House for 17 years and Minister for Home Affairs during the depression years from 1929 to 1932. That portfolio must have been one of the most onerous of any for a Minister to carry during that time. We honour him for the work he did, and on behalf of my Party I extend sympathy to his family. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister a question. The right honourable gentleman will have noted the exceptionally detailed forecasts of the provisions in tonight's Budget which were given on a television network last Sunday night. While the accuracy of these forecasts naturally cannot be tested until the Treasurer delivers his speech tonight, I ask the Prime Minister whether he can assure the House that he had no discussions with this particular commentator about the Budget. I also ask him whether he has checked with his Ministers on whether they had any discussions with this commentator. </para>

Coming back to the question, the Government has again given consideration to the problem of holding an inquiry into poverty in Australia and we have agreed that such an inquiry will be instituted. Already the Minister for Social Services has prepared draft terms of reference which will be further considered by the Government, and when that has been done we will decide on the person or persons who will carry out the inquiry. </para>

            <para>- On the contrary, I have the full text of what has been said by the Prime Minister of Singapore. He said that he accepts - and rightly accepts - the constitutional position of the Australian Government. He went on to say that if the Australian Labor Party did become the Government, it would have a sovereign right to withdraw troops from Singapore. That is the context in which the statement of the Prime Minister of Singapore has to be accepted. I remind the honourable gentleman of our policy, which is welcomed by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. They welcome our troops there and they have not expressed any intention of withdrawing them. We too, if I can state our position very clearly, are anxious and willing to retain our troops there while they are wanted. As the honourable gentleman would know from the statements I made while I was overseas, in the communique between Tun Razak, the Malaysian Prime Minister, and myself and in statements made while I was in Singapore, our Air Force is welcomed in one place and elements of our fighting Services in another. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also point out to the House that not only must it be recognised that if the Labor Party has its way we would have no capacity to bring a degree of confidence to these countries and to give them an ability to expand their operations in order to have greater development programmes, but it is my belief that if the statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were accepted we would have very little capacity to defend ourselves. </para>

Is it also a fact that in the last  7  months  168  unauthorised stoppages have taken place at this meatworks? Did any member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or any member of the Labor Party move in any way to prevent this anarchic nonsense or were orders taken from the left wing unions that the members of the Australian Labor Party were not to intervene in any way to prevent this stupidity over the last  7  months?

              <para>- The facts are that the Riverstone Meat Co. Pty Ltd has announced the retrenchment of some  700  workers and the closure of sections of its meat operation which is a subsidiary' of the W. Angliss Meat Company. The reason for this is clear and was adverted to by the honourable gentleman - that is, that since January this year there have been  168  stoppages in this plant. Of course, that will have an impact on honourable gentlemen on this side of the House as it should have on honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House. It is a classic example of the extent to which unemployment in the community at the present time is caused by sporadic stoppages of the type which have been mentioned and which have been condoned consistently by members of the Opposition. As the honourable, gentleman mentioned in his question, I recall no statement made by any member pf the Opposition or any member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions , deploring what has been a series of irresponsible stoppages which have led directly to the unemployment of men. The House might well ponder the simple fact that here again is a circumstance in which  700  men have lost jobs and sections of a company have been closed down simply because of the  168  stoppages to which they have been subject during a period of only  6  to  7  months. It is almost inconceivable that this should be the case, but in- fact it is the case and it is a point well worth the attention of honourable gentlemen on the other side. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question by stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Kinsela,  a constituent of mine, captain of the- Australian wrestling team at the Munich Olympic Games and a representative of Australia at  the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games, also the holder of the Queen's Scout Award, the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award, a leader in Rotary Youth and a Vietnam veteran of 1970-71, used his savings as a deposit on a small oar of which he was owner-driver for All Purpose Messengers. John, a part Aborigine, is one of a big family that he helps to support and also has a wife and 9-weeks old baby living with his mother and family, but owing to John's being in Munich his wife, child, mother and younger members of the family are now in straitened circumstances. I ask the Minister for Social Services whether there is any way in which his Department can assist to alleviate their distress. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member was good enough earlier today to bring this matter to my attention. There are no funds at my disposal which could be used for this purpose, but I have no doubt that the Australian people would see that funds were made available. I know that honourable members in this House, including myself, would be only too willing to see that this matter was made good. But I have had today a communication with officials of the Australian Amateur Athletics Association. There is some difficulty about the breaching of Olympic rules and this has to be looked at to see what can be done. I think we can assure the people concerned that something will be done, although we will be careful to stay within the limits imposed by the Olympic Committee. </para>

            <para>- It is true that as a result of the increase in Japanese quotas and the lifting of the import quota in the United States this year there will be con siderable opportunities for Australian meat exporters. I am assured by my Department that there is an adequacy of available facilities but much will depend on the degree to which they can be utilised. Already during this question time my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, has identified one area in which the available facilities are constricted by irresponsible stoppages, activities which of course directly affect the ability of exporters to supply the available market and to satisfy the needs of customers who are willing purchasers. If any similar movement were to spread throughout the meat industry it would be doubtful whether there were sufficient facilities. I am assured that given the availability of facilities and preparedness to work more than one shift per day, however, there is every ability within the availability of existing structures for the expected level of demand to be satisfied. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister for Shipping and Transport aware that 95 per cent of Tasmania's cargo trade is carried by sea, with no road or rail alternatives as on the mainland? Has the Minister power to cancel out, in the public interest, a decision of the Australian National Line to increase freight rates? Is he aware of the recent freight rate rise which has again cast a blow at Tasmania's economy, especially at the tourist trade? Finally, will this Government seriously consider a freight subsidy as was paid in the days when the 'Taroona' operated across the Strait? The position today is much worse than it was then. </para>

            <para>- I am certainly aware of the changes in freight rates that the Australian National Line has effected in the Tasmanian trade. The freight rate increases average 1 per cent across the board. There was no general increase in the freight rate to Tasmania on this occasion. Rather, the Australian National Line sought to rationalise the services to Tasmania in an effort to meet the problems of increasing costs of wages, repairs and maintenance. Despite all its efforts of rationalising to meet increasing costs, the ANL nevertheless has had to make some adjustments to the freight rates. As a result, as I have said, it has increased freight rates on an average by 1 per cent. This increase will raise approximately an extra $200,000 against a possible or estimated loss of $1.8m, the balance of which the ANL is trying to save by the rationalisation programme. The ANL has increased the fares on the passenger service, which is its heavy loser, on the run to Sydney by 10 per cent and on the run to Melbourne by 15 per cent. This will raise an extra $150,000. Certainly, the increased charges are to be regretted, but in the face of the awful increases in costs for wages, repairs, maintenance and general overhauls that the Line has suffered, there was nothing else that it could do. The honourable member raised a question of freight subsidy. This is a proposal that has been looked at from time to time by the Government and has been rejected from time to time. </para>

            <para>- My own Department has not carried out studies of the type suggested by the honourable gentleman but I believe that this certainly would be a worthwhile area of inquiry at present, because if one looks back at the calendar year of 1971 one will see that average weekly earnings during that 12-monih period increased by 12.5 per cent and the consumer price index increased by 4.8 per cent as against a long term productivity growth increase of 2.5 per cent. As the honourable gentleman inferred, or directly stated, one of the inhibiting factors in the labour policies of companies throughout this country certainly is the high cost of labour. This is clear if one reflects on the increase in average weekly earnings to which I have made reference. There is no doubt that this is a factor not of insignificance in relation to the employment policies of employers at present. Equally, as the honourable gentleman has said, the continuing series of stoppages is a major factor which impacts itself upon the whole problem facing the Australian com*munity. which is the confidence of the business community in relation to investment and of consumers in relation to thenspending patterns. As the House will be well aware, during the last year the number of man days lost was 3 million, which was an increase of 28 per cent over that of the previous year. The Australian wage earners during that period lost- </para>

            <para>- The honourable gentleman asks a series of detailed questions. Of course, I will examine the questions which he has posed for the purpose of supplying a written answer. No member of this House would expect any Minister to carry such information with him in order to give an impromptu response to a question without notice. The honourable gentleman is making the allegation or inference, or the direct statement, that this Government is not vigorous in relation to its follow up of defaulters under the National Service Act. The facts simply are these, as I recall them: In the first place, the proportion of those who do not register for national service is approximately 2 per cent. The proportion of those persons in the second area of default, that is those who do not attend for medical examination, is 0.3 per cent or 0.03 per cent', whatever it is, it is still insignificant. The proportion of those in the third area of default, that is those who fail to render service, is 0.2 per cent. These facts indicate quite clearly that there is no substance in any general allegation that the Government is not vigorous in enforcing the requirements of the National Service Act. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable gentleman specifically asked some questions about figures. In 1971-72, 106,833 persons registered for national service. The number of persons registered up to 30th June 1972 - a period of 74 years - was 749,922. Those who failed to register at the appropriate time and therefore were denied the benefit of the ballot in the year 1971-72 numbered 2,306, or 2.2 per cent of the total. Some 723 were prosecuted and convicted for failing to register during that period. </para>

            <para>- I cannot give the honourable gentleman an accurate estimate of the percentage of Aborigines to Europeans who were camped at the 'embassy'. We did have a transitory group of people over the period of the 6 months that they were camped in the 'embassy'. In fact, when one group left another group arrived. They were mostly part Aborigines. On the days of confrontation, certainly the Aborigines and part-Aborigines were in the minority to the Europeans who were involved in the confrontation. </para>

            <para>- Because this matter could be sub judice the honourable member will forgive me for answering the question in a different way from which it was put to me. The honourable member will recall writing to me, I think in June, pointing out that certain auction sales which purported to be auction sales of customs goods were taking place, whereas in fact the sales were not of goods that had been confiscated by my Department. We have conducted extensive inquiries and have discovered that there has been some confusion, either deliberately or accidentally caused, not only in Victoria but in other States, by use of the word 'custom' in the advertising matter and, in some cases, by salesmen wearing uniforms that bordered perilously close to those uniforms used by customs officers some years ago. The matter has been referred, in certain specific cases, to the Crown Law authorities and other action is being taken to make the public aware of this matter. I might say that when such sales of confiscated customs goods are made they are advertised by the Collector of Customs in each State and the sales are conducted through reputable, well recognised auctioneers only. I thank the honourable gentleman for bringing the matter to my attention. </para>

In nearly all cases, as I understand it, they are related to the particular requirements of a course of treatment. Quite apart from that there does exist, under the Act, authority for the Commonwealth Director of Health in the State concerned, on application by the patient's medical practitioner, to authorise a larger quantity than that laid down, namely, 3 months supply. But it is up to the doctor whether he applies; because he might feel it necessary, in the patient's interest for the patient to come back and see him so that he can check on the patient's condition in a shorter period than 3 months. I will convey the honourable gentleman's <inline font-style="italic">question to</inline> my colleague and ask him to supply the honourable member with a detailed reply. </para>

            <para>- Honourable members will remember that there was a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers on the matter of a warning on cigarette packets. I was informed that some of the States could not see their way clear to include a warning on cigarette packets until 1st May next year. Having made inquiries, I understand that 2 States - Western Australia and Victoria - will require the warning to appear on packages as from 1st January. Under that circumstance I believe that the proclamation relating to advertising on radio and television should apply from the same date. It will apply for the whole of Australia, So, there will be an element of conflict in some States as between the warning given on packages and that given on radio and television. </para>

            <para>- It is very easy for honourable members to make assertions such as the honourable member has made relating to delays. I am sure that the majority of the Australian public appreciate that great technical requirements are involved in the establishment or furtherance of television in any part of Australia. A good deal of the equipment must come from overseas and, if there is delay in delivery of that equipment, there is delay in completion of the installation. I assure the honourable member, as I assure those members of the public who do not have television and wish to have it at an earlier time than it is expected to be provided, that every endeavour is made by the authorities responsible to meet target dates; but this is not possible in all cases, for reasons beyond the control of those who have the responsibility. </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that colour television will be possible as from 1st March 1975. It is .not . expected by the Government - or, I think, by most members of the House - that every station will have colour television as. from 1st March 1975. That statement applies to the national service, as well as to. the . commercial service. The commercial stations are protected to a degree by the ownership provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act and it is not anticipated -that any. other protection will be required for them. I think most of us appreciate that some stations will find no difficulty in financing the establishment, of colour television, whereas others may have difficulty. I think it will be understood that there will be delay in the case of some stations, but I . will be surprised if there are many stations which are not able to arrange the necessary finance to achieve the introduction of colour television by a date not long after 1st March 1975.

            <para>- During the recent oil strike in this country fuel was cut off to the community, some tens of thousands were thrown out of work and the jobs of hundreds of thousands were put in jeopardy because a small group of trade unionists in this country was prepared, against the interests of the great majority of the wage earners of Australia, to refuse to accept the interim decision which had been handed down by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore and to down tools at the expense of their fellow unionists and at the expense of the country. The honourable gentleman asked me what action was taken by the Government. As honourable gentlemen on this side are very well aware, the Prime Minister, in a very firm statement, foreshadowed that this House would be called together if the strike were not solved within a period of 5 working days. That initiative was then followed by the initiative taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Short of the Federated Ironworkers Association, and finally the initiative taken by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore. These were the significant developments which led to the solution of that dispute. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not know what the honourable gentleman means by 'other parties'. If he refers to the official Opposition in this chamber, the House will be well aware that the Opposition took no concrete or constructive approach In seeking to solve this dispute, except to say that the parties ought to continue talking. There were no suggestions from the Leader of the Opposition that the men ought to return to work and negotiate their claims before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Let me say by way of a casual observation what a pathetic comment it is on Opposition members in this chamber that on a day following the release of the employment figures for this country there has -been not one question on unemployment from the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- Taking up the Minister's invitation with pleasure, I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that Western Australia has now had a higher rate of unemployment than any other mainland State for over a. year? Is it also a fact that, unlike most other States, Western Australia's unemployment is concentrated in the metropolitan area where no assistance at all is received from the Commonwealth's only emergency employment measure, the rural unemployment grant? Has the Commonwealth ignored or rejected at least 3 requests from the Western Australian Government for unemployment relief directed specifically to the metropolitan area? If so, why? </para>

            <para>- The honourable gentleman queries the position in relation to unemployment in Western Australia. It is certainly true that it is running at a much higher level than the national, average. It is also true that the Western Australian unemployment figures have been running at a much higher level than the national average for a long period of time. The honourable gentleman concurs; I see him nodding his head. The facts are that in the labour market in that State a deterioration has taken place during the course of the past 2 to 3 years. The factors which have been responsible for that position are simply these: Firstly, there has been the turndown in the number of major developmental projects and this has reduced employment in that area from 10,000 to - as I recall it - approximately 3,000. This has had an effect on associated manufacturing, supplier and engineering firms. Secondly, there has been a turndown in mineral activity because of trading conditions which will be well known to the honourable gentleman as he comes from that State. Also I recall the downturn in primary industry from about 1969. But there are some encouraging factors in </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Western Australia. Firstly, farmers are reporting better seasons. Secondly, there are signs of increased optimism in the building and construction industry. Finally, the gold mining industry is expected to reach this year its highest production level for many years. </para>
          <para>I discussed this matter with the Western Australian Minister for Labour during a recent visit to that State. Naturally, the substance of my conversation with him is a matter for the Minister concerned and is not subject to comment in this House. The problem which faces Western Australia is not new and it is not due to any factors generated by the recent economic circumstances. In making that statement I am thinking of the past few months and the unemployment picture I have painted. The fact remains that the Western Australian Government must go out and sell that State. It must bring into Western Australia new and more broadly diversified industries of a labour intensive nature. Specifically, the answer to any question of special grants is no. </para>

            <para>That this House has no confidence in the Minister for the Interior because of his handling of the affair of the removal of the Aboriginal embassy' from the lawns in front of Parliament House. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In January there was a tent erected on the lawns in front of Parliament House to express the points of view of persons concerned about the position and status of Aborigines in this country. It was actually the second occasion on which such a tent was erected. Honourable members will recall that some 3 or 4 years ago a vigil was organised in front of Parliament House to express concern about the position of Aborigines in this country. As the weather at that time was cold and wet a tent was erected, not to the left of Parliament House - treating 'left' as one's left when one stands - at the front door as occurred on the second occasion - but to the right of it. That tent was erected by Commonwealth police officers themselves. They erected h as a shelter for the demonstrators, and 1 understand that they put braziers in the tent to warm the demonstrators. I think it is obvious that that event of 3 or 4 years ago was what inspired the idea of having a tent on the lawns in front of Parliament House as a way of demonstrating. The first tent was erected by Commonwealth police officers themselves. </para>
          <para>We have the advantage, through a debate in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, of finding out the assessment by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> of the situation. Upon that assessment he apparently acted. He expressed it in a telegram apologising for his inability to attend the opening of the Tennant Creek Sports Club. In explaining why he could not attend that function, he referred to what he regarded as the frightful dangers developing in Canberra. The Minister's telegram read as follows: </para>

            <para>Because elements of left wing unions and radicals threaten to cause violent demonstrations and possible bloodshed in Canberra this weekend, as was demonstrated last Sunday, I am required by the Prime Minister to return to Canberra for consultation and take steps to prevent radical elements from using Aboriginal movements for their own purposes. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This lurid assessment of the situation is apparently the motivation of the Minister's actions. I am at a loss to understand the thinking of a succession of Country Party Ministers for the Interior whom we have had and who have handled the affairs of the Australian Capital Territory. I remember that in August 1966, when the present Leader of the Australian Country Party was Minister for the Interior, there suddenly appeared in the 'Canberra Times' a picture of a new riot squad being trained in Canberra as part of the Canberra police. They had machine guns; they had steel helmets; they had shields; and they had gas masks. After these photographs appeared in the 'Canberra Times'. I asked the then Minister for the Interior why, in what was obviously the most peaceful capital in the Western world, it was necessary to create so fearsome a riot squad. I understand that a good deal of this equipment ultimately left the Australian Capital Territory and perhaps appeared later in Bougainville. It was similar to the equipment which was used during the original Bougainville clash. There seems to me to be a tendency to over-reaction, if not hysteria, on the part of Ministers who handle the affairs of Canberra. </para>
          <para>I return to the present Minister for the Interior and the extraordinary statement that the situation in front of Parliament House involved 'left wing unions and radicals'. Heavens above, the 'Embassy' had been there for about 7 months. I do not know what figures from left wing unions and radicals appeared there, but I would not have thought it would have mattered very much if people from left wing unions and radicals, or for that matter right wing unions, had appeared there. The 'Embassy* was a tolerated demonstration over a period of 7 months. Subsequently a pretence was made to the public in a series of utterances that what had been discovered was that the Commonwealth Government jacked legal power to cope with squatters on public parks. When the case was before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, he pointed out that the Commonwealth had at all times had power oh an application to the court to remove the tent and that the Commissioner of Police and the Minister admitted that the Commonwealth had this power. The Minister did not seek that court procedure to remove the tent - as he wanted to - because there would have been a court case in which public arguments would have been put and reported.

          <para>The reaction of the Minister, apart from the completely unnecessary clashes which took place, has been to bring down a new ordinance - one which is unnecessary, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox pointed out, because of the already existing powers of the Commonwealth, but one in which significant changes in the law were made and made in a particular direction to which all parties represented on the Senate committee which examines regulations and ordinances have always taken exception, namely, the procedure set out in section 8c (1.) which reads:  8c. - (1.) An officer of the Department of the Interior authorised in writing by the Minister may, by instrument in writing under his hand, certify that land described in the instrument or by reference to a plan on or annexed to the instrument is  unleashed  land that - </para>

          <para class="block">The old ordinance denned the city limits of Canberra quite clearly. We now have a situation in which the Minister may empower an officer and that officer by instrument in writing can declare that an area comes within the scope of the regulations. No process of publicity is necessary. It is just this exchange of defined power to one exercised from an instrument in writing which gives force and possible objectionable character to the regulations about which people may not know. The situation will be worse when this procedure fs in force than what existed before the regulations were gazetted. The regulations were gazetted and they transformed the state of the law. Erroneous statements were given out from the Government to justify the promulgation of this ordinance to the effect that the Commonwealth lacked the power to prevent trespass. Therefore, the people occupying the land might have assumed that they had a legal right to be there - since the Government itself suggested there was no law. in 40 minutes after a change in the law people, outside were expected to know the law,; and then the proceedings of ejection took place. This is what led to the clash. </para>

It happens that we have  a  distinguished senator who is  a  member of the Liberal Party of Australia and also an Aborigine.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">We also are disgusted with its action in this issue. We share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner's</inline> opinion. This is the reason why this motion has been moved. The Minister may say that it was necessary to remove the tent. A similar viewpoint has been taken by the rel* vant committee of the Parliament of Western Australia, namely, that the tent in front of the West Australian Parliament House, which is a protest against the conditions of Aboriginal housing in Western Australia, should ultimately be removed. Discussions apparently took place between the Premier of Western Australia and the demonstrators and it was agreed that after the Budget they would remove the tent. Their hopes rested on the Budget providing an adequate amount for Aboriginal housing in Western Australia, which is estimated by the State Government to need $19m although I understand the Commonwealth offering has not been one-ninth of that sum. The demonstration will continue up to the time the Budget was introduced, to emphasise the position of Aboriginal housing. 1 repeat that they agreed to remove the tent after the Budget was introduced. This was the result of sensible conversations and not the bulldozing and unfair method which the Minister used. </para>
          <para>Assurances apparently were given by the Government to the Aboriginal senator that the ordinances would be debated. What transpired was a deliberate evasion of the Parliament and the Minister's counsel was unable to deny the point made by the judge in the court case that existing power was adequate for the Government if they went through the proper judicial process. All these things show that what the Minister wanted to do he wanted to do clandestinely. We can understand this if we accept the hysterical assessment which the Minister made in the telegram he sent concerning the Tennant Creek sporting club. If this is his assessment of the situation, it is extremely dangerous to have a Minister handling these situations who views himself as being confronted by a colossal, lurid left wing plot when he is dealing with a group of Aboriginal demonstrators outside. I do not agree with the utterances of Black Power people. I do not believe in the method adopted by the Minister. Many demonstrators were not associated with Black Power but were Aboriginal or partAboriginal persons genuinely concerned for their people. Not only were there reactions from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> but also damaging reactions abroad. One of the most respected newspapers in the United Kingdom is the 'Guardian', which used to be called the 'Manchester Guardian'. It drew attention to an appeal made to  Her  Majesty the Queen by the people ejected from that tent. That newspaper made the following comment: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The appeal made to the Queen recently by Australia's Aborigines asking her to prevent the Canberra Government  fron  enacting legislation said to be discriminatory, is bound to cause considerable embarrassment to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon's</inline> Government. </para>
            <para>The Aboriginal leaders have asked the Queen to order Australia's Governor-General to reserve the promulgation 'for your Majesty's pleasure' of an ordinance that would empower the Government to remove the Aboriginal 'embassy' which has been encamped on the lawns of the Federal Parliament for S months. </para>
            <para>The embassy- a dozen tan-and-orange tents - was established earlier this year after the rejection of an appeal by Aborigines whose tribal lands were threatened by mining development </para>
            <para>It has achieved remarkable success in focusing Australian opinion on the plight of the Aborigine. </para>
            <para>Initially, the Federal Government tolerated the embassy, but as the issue became more of a thorn - and the protest more effective - it foreshadowed the introduction of an ordinance to clear the tents. </para>
            <para>Australia's racial policies already stick in the throats of Asian nations, and with the SEATO conference opening in Canberra next month the Government apparently felt that the embassy's continued presence (within sight of the conference hall) could bring even worse problems. </para>
            <para>The Aboriginal embassy's letter told the Queen that, if the ordinance is allowed to become law, it is likely to result in a serious abrogation of the rights of all Australians, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, to bring before the Federal Parliament a continuous peaceful protest </para>
            <para>We therefore appeal to your Majesty as Queen and the ultimate source of protection, to direct his  Excellency  the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, that, upon such time as the proposed ordinance is presented to him for promulgation, he reserve the promulgation of it for your Majesty's pleasure.' </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is unfortunate and extremely damaging to Australia that in such temperate and sensible terms, although they may not be constitutionally informed, the denizens of that tent and the organisers of the demonstrations from the tent have put a statement of the utmost dignity correctly diagnosing the Government's motives before the people of Britain. </para>
          <para>I disliked the appearance of those tents outside. They were described by somebody as visual pollution. I take the point of view that they constituted visual pollution. The sight of the tents on what was a beautiful stretch seemed to me completely to spoil the view of Canberra. I travelled 21,000 miles with a select committee inquiring into Aboriginal voting rights, but that place was a palace compared to what I saw as a member of that committee and the conditions under which Aborigines live in the south-west of Western Australia, around Gnowangerup and elsewhere where the weather is extremely cold, or generally speaking, throughout the Northern Territory. I would say it was even superior to the transitional dwellings, usually made out of aluminium and entirely inappropriate to the climate where they are erected, which are built for Aborigines in the rest of Australia. So I say to myself: 'Much as I disliked the place being out there, it put before us constantly the position of the Aboriginal people, especially in relation to their accommodation'. </para>
          <para>One of the most distinguished Aborigines in the country, one of the most highly educated - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Roberts - many years before he was an employee of the Commonwealth spoke about the conditions of the Aborigines. He said: 'You live like princes; we live like dogs in the dust'.. He was not referring to people who lived with the dignity of nomadic and tribal life and who do not particularly need the shelters in the form required by Europeans. He was referring to people whose aspirations are towards standards of living similar to those of Europeans. It is easy to deride these people. Some of them, not all  by  any means, use the jargon of New. York negro Black Power. They talk  about Caucasians  meaning white people. They are apparently unaware that Aborigines themselves are  Caucasians.  All these  logical  things we can point out. But outside this Parliament was a protest of the heart, which was by no means ineffective ia speaking to the conscience of Australia in the persons of thousands of tourists -and others who visit this city. </para>
          <para>If we have any sensitivity at all, we should take the trouble to see the conditions of Aborigines to remind us of the problem with which we ought to be deal. ing motivated by the utmost generosity. All through this situation we had firstly a Liberal Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable W. C. Wentworth, and now  we have  the Minister  for  the Environment Aborigines and the Arts,  the </para>
          <para class="block">Honourable Peter Howson co existing with a Country Party Minister in charge of the land and in charge of practical events. When any of these Aboriginal evictions or denials of right take place the Liberal Minister who is supposedly the defender of the Aborigines does, like the House of Lords in Gilbert and Sullivan, nothing in particular and does it very . well. There seemed to be no ministerial concern from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We heard of no ministerial protection being given or no concern being expressed. The regulations were gazetted and. the duty to conduct an unnecessary clash was imposed upon the police of Canberra and upon the people who were in the tents. This proceeded from the extraordinary, assessment of a situation of great danger which was made by the Minister for the Interior and for knowledge of which we are indebted to the Northern Territory Legislative Council which gave publicity to his telegram. </para>

              <para>- I will tell the honourable member what happened at Sharpeville. On 26th March 1960 at Sharpeville -in South Africa there was a direct confrontation between black Africans and police,- leaving 67 people dead and 168 injured. It was against that background that I felt I had to return to Canberra to talk to people to ensure that we did not have the violence that was predicted by some people. I have read that the main thrust of the attack that has been upon me as the responsible Minister is related to the propriety of gazetting the amended Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance while Parliament was in recess. I remind the House that the Ordinance was made under the provisions of section 12 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act. The Ordinance was designed by the Government to prohibit camping on unleashed land in the city area of Canberra unless such land had been declared a camping area by the Minister for the Interior or unless a permit had been granted in relation to one of the special purposes identified in the Ordinance. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The honourable member for Fremantle quoted what one of our learned judges in Canberra has said but the legal advice that was available to the Government indicated that in order to protect unleashed Commonwealth lands from camping, whether it be on median strips, nature strips or areas around Parliament House, the Ordinance itself would have to be amended. So acting on that advice the Government amended the Ordinance. The legislation does not restrict the traditional rights of freedom of speech or assembly or the rights of people to protest. This form of legislation gives powers similar to that which relates to the control of camping on what might be described as municipal land and is common throughout Australia. As honourable members wm recall, the so-called embassy was established on 26th January 1972, and legal advice given to the Government was that existing law did not satisfactorily cover the situation and that it was desirable to have specific provisions. In February 1972, hi answer to a question from the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> atom the campers, I indicated that the people concerned were Aborigines demonstrating in a peaceful way for a cause in which they believed. But I said that for the future we would have to look at the Ordinance to ensure that the Parliament House lawns were reserved for their proper use and were not to be a place on which persons could camp indefinitely. The fundamental fact remains that the Government was faced with the situation in which any protest group or minority group, whether they be fascists, Croatians, unionists, pensioners, wool growers, wheat growers - you name it - could camp with impunity on the lawns outside this building or on unleashed land in the city area of the national capital, Canberra. How could a responsible Government tolerate such a situation when a defect in the law had been exposed. </para>
          <para>It is not a question of the Government taking action against the Aborigines; it is a question of the Government facing up to its responsibilities of preserving public places in Canberra for public use. Surely no group should have the right to pitch tents indiscriminately and to proclaim a cause for a lengthy period, thereby impeding the access of people to public areas. It was to give effect to that basic principle that the amendments to the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance were drafted. It was not an easy exercise, because it was necessary to balance adequately the right of individuals against that of the public interest. On 11th May 1972 I stated to this House that the Government intended to bring in an Ordinance. I made it clear that the Ordinance would make it generally an offence for persons to camp on unleashed land in the city area and would empower authorities to remove their possessions if they did not comply within a reasonable time with a direction to remove them. In my statement I stressed that the law would apply to the areas around Parliament House. An identical statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> in the Senate and it is important to recall that not one member of the Opposition either in this House or in the Senate took the opportunity to challenge the Government's intention or decision in this matter. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry if I spoil the honourable member's story. I remind the House that I was not under any obligation to make such a statement, although in the circumstances of this case I felt it was necessary to give every member of the Parliament a chance to voice his view before the Ordinance was made. At that time the camp bad been in existence for some 3 months during which time it had deteriorated significantly. Soon after the Parliament had been informed of the Government's intentions I had the first of a number of discussions with representatives of the campers, the then spokesmen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Newfong, in particular. I spoke with other Aboriginal leaders, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joe</inline> MacGinness and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chicka</inline> Dixon of the Federal Council of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I also had discussions with the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and the honourable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cross)</inline> about the removal of the embassy. During all these discussions I made it clear that the Government was firm in its intention to legislate to prevent people from pitching tents at will in the city area. In the course of these discussions we canvassed the possibility of a national representative group of Aborigines obtaining a more permanent and dignified presence in Canberra. I held firmly to the view that the continued presence of scruffy tents outside Parliament House was not serving either the interests of the Aboriginal people or the Parliament in a dignified way. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>In accordance with practice, the amending ordinance was referred to the Australian Capital Advisory Council on 13th June, that is, about 5 weeks before the removal of the embassy. The member for the Australian Capital Territory was given a copy of the Ordinance on 1st June and I am told that he lost it but subsequently obtained another. The Ordinance was made in the normal way but before it became law a senior officer of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force visited the campers on 17th July. They were informed that the law would be introduced shortly and that it would require them to remove themselves and their tents from the lawns. The campers were provided with a copy of the proposed Ordinance and an explantion of its effect. The officer concerned gained the clear impression that they would comply with the law when it was introduced. </para>
          <para>Indeed, on 18th July in the 'Canberra News', it was reported: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Staff at the Aboriginal 'Embassy' say that they will co-operate with the Australian Capital Territory police and move their camp on the lawns opposite Parliament House without violence. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the same report the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory was reported as saying that it was imperative in the interests of decency that no action be taken against the embassy on the lawns of Parliament House until the Parliament was in session. Perhaps this was the catalyst which caused the change of attitude. Indeed, in the 'Canberra News' a camp spokesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ambrose</inline> Brown, said that they would not resist the police and members would maintain operations from an office in Canberra. </para>
          <para>The ordinance was gazetted on 20th July 1972 and was publicly available at 10.30 a.m. on that date. Shortly after, the ACT police informed the campers that the law had been made and requested the campers to remove their tents from the lawns. It was at this point that there was a dramatic change of attitude. For the first time, the campers indicated to the police that they would not move voluntarily. It is significant that, whereas normally the so-called 'embassy' has been staffed by only one or two persons, on the date on which the Ordinance was gazetted the police were confronted by forty or more people in an organised demonstration. The police requested the demonstrators, comprising part Aborigines and Europeans, to permit them to remove the remaining tent. They were warned that if they did not do so they would be obstructing the police in the execution of their duty. The demonstrators made it clear that they had no intention of moving, and accordingly the police removed the tent. The Police Commis- sioner informed me that the resistance by the demonstrators was more excessive than at any previous demonstration in the ACT. </para>
          <para>In an effort to avoid further confrontation and violence, officers of my Department, including the Police Commissioner, met with representatives of the demonstrators on Sunday morning, 23rd July. An offer was made to assist the accommodation problems of those campers involved in legal proceedings to test the validity of the Ordinance. This offer was not taken up. While these discussions were in progress it was learned that a further demonstration had already commenced and that a body of demonstrators was marching from the Australian National University to Parliament House. On their arrival at Parliament House the demonstrators attempted to erect a tent in the area previously occupied by the campers. The police advised them that any attempt to re-erect the tent would be in contravention of the existing law. This advice was ignored and they elected the tent. The police dismantled the tent after the demonstrators had ignored the repeated police requests. </para>
          <para>We then move on to a further demonstration on 30th July. It was reported that plans were being made for a much larger demonstration on 30th July. Arrangements were made for busloads of demonstrators to converge on Canberra from many parts of Australia. Militant left wing unions, including the New South Wales branch of the Builders Labourers Union were planning to become involved. Indeed, it was reported that the so-called 'front line troops' of the Builders Labourers Union - thugs and bikies - were also planning to participate, lt was against this background that on 26th July I met with representatives of the demonstrators and discussed with them a more dignified permanent presence in the national capital for some truly representative Aboriginal group. (Extension of time granted.) I would like to thank the honourable member for Fremantle for his courtesy in moving for an extension of time. However, I made it clear that, in the terms of the law, the tents could not be erected outside Parliament House on unleashed land in the city area. Further conferences took place on 28th July between officers of my Department and representatives of the demonstrators then in Canberra. </para>
          <para class="block">An endeavour was made to persuade the demonstrators to call off the movement of interstate professional demonstrators to Canberra. It was agreed that the Commonwealth would bring 9 leaders nominated by the Aborigines to Canberra to discuss the matter with the Ministers. </para>
          <para>On 29th July my colleagues, the Minister for Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> and the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the  Chairman  of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Coombs)</inline> and officers of my Department met with Aboriginal leaders in Canberra. The discussions lasted 2 hours. While the discussions were taking place the demonstrators were converging on Canberra from a number of centres throughout Australia. For the record, I am pleased to say that, in spite of attempts by radical groups to pressure Aborigines from my own home town of Moree, they refused to be associated with the activities of those who were hell-bent on creating further violence outside Parliament House. </para>
          <para>On Sunday, 30th July, there was a large demonstration outside Parliament House involving 2,000 demonstrators. Every effort was made to avoid serious risk of violence and injury, and although the police were in strength on this occasion they made no effort to interfere with or to prevent what was recognised as the temporary erection of a tent on the lawns as a symbolic gesture. At the invitation and with the cooperation of the demonstrators the tent was removed in the afternoon. Although all the seeds of violence were present on that Sunday afternoon, the police behaved in an exemplary fashion while under considerable pressure. The majority of the Aboriginal leaders sought to restrain, and in fact succeeded in restraining, the more radical elements. Indeed, I would like to quote from a letter I have received from the Australian Capita] Territory Council of Civil Liberties. The Secretary wrote: </para>

            <para>While the opinions of my council and your colleagues in the Government may differ widely as to the desirability and conduct of demonstrations of the type that took place last Sunday, I am sure that we will all agree that the events of last Sunday went a long way to strengthening the democratic processes which we are all proud of in Australia. </para>

        <para class="block">As Minister for the Interior executing a Government decision, I am confident that I do not deserve to be the object of a motion of censure in this House. I repeat that the Government decided to amend the Ordinance to prevent people from camping at will on unleashed Gommonealth land in the city area. Notice was given to this effect in this Parliament on 11th May. No Opposition member chose to debate the issue on that day. I repeatedly stated that the Government was firm in its intention. I had numerous discussions with the Aborigines concerned. I stressed that they had had a fair go. They had been there for over 6 months and they had made their point. They were not bringing dignity to the Parliament or to themselves in continuing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> camp in the way they were. The camp had degenerated into a squabbling, untidy and insanitary spectacle. I sought to find a more dignified presence for the Aborigines in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
        <para>I believe that the whole situation surrounding this affair has been influenced by the political objectives of certain sections of the Australian Labor Party. I do not underestimate their involvement in what must surely be one of the most mischievous plots of our time. The Government has a great sympathy with the problems of the Aboriginal people but we have to remember what the campers were demanding. For the purposes of the record what the campers were demanding was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on 7lh February 1972, as follows: </para>

          <para>Full State rights for the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership.

Compensation of an initial payment of $6 billion for all other land throughout Australia and a percentage of the gross national product each year. </para>

        <para class="block">In a debate in this House on 23rd February 1972 I asked the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> what was the Labor Party policy in relation to the recognition of traditional land rights outside reserves. I asked whether the Labor Party believed that compensation should be paid to Aborigines who claim traditional land outside reserves. As far as I know there has been no reply. In exercising my responsibility as the Minister for the Interior in this Government 1 regret that violence did occur and that injuries were sustained. I regret that outside stirrers succeeded in their endeavours, but I make no apologies for the efforts I made to administer the law and to prevent the violence which occurred on Sunday, 30th July 1972. </para>

            <para>- Towards the end of the speech made by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> we heard the true opposition or argument from the Government as to why the Aboriginal embassy was there. It had nothing to do with tents or with people camping on Commonwealth Crown Land, The real opposition from the Government, the real thing that offended it, the real thing it could not stomach, was the reminder out there by those 2 flags, the sign 'Aboriginal Embassy' in a symbolic form, and the tents, that these people claim land rights - something that was taken from them many years ago. That is a political thing, and towards the end of his speech the Minister reiterated it and came back to it; it was the point on which he wanted to finish. He said that the Aborigines were there for political reasons; that they were there not just to live in a tent but to make a political point; and that they were exercising a right to assemble. This statement came right out of the Minister's mouth. There are a number of reasons why this House should not have confidence in the Minister for the Interior. It is quite a pity that there are almost no Liberals present in the chamber. </para>

              <para>- Yes, have a look at those 2 or 3 - with one notable exception. At the moment the Government benches consist almost entirely of members of the Australian Country Party. Where are the Liberals who espouse Liberal principles? Unfortunately 15 minutes is not a long enough time in which to cover all the points. The Minister said that the Aboriginal embassy came there on Australia Day. Rather he omitted to say that, but it was Australia Day. The Aborigines made it clear that they hoped to stay there until Parliament began sitting in order to make their point - the Minister says it was a political point - concerning a claim for land rights. The Government kept saying: 'We will not tolerate their presence'. Naturally, like any human being, the Aborigines said: We will not be told not to do something which we want to do, which is completely legal and which we are allowed to do'. They said that they would stay on until President Suharto from Indonesia came. Again, they were on the verge of going and again the Government came along and said: 'You will go'. It was at that time that the Press began to play it up. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Because the Minister for the Interior has made so much of the lack of opposition, as he calls it, from the Labor Party on the 11th May, let me give some examples of the opposition that was made. In March I sent a telegram to the Minister saying that I personally opposed any move to move the Aboriginal embassy and that if the Minister was going across to the embassy I would like to go with him. But I received no answer to or no acknowledgment of the telegram I sent on 6th March this year. Towards the end of March the Labor Party members on the Opposition benches produced to this Parliament 10 or 12 petitions from my constituents - people who live in the Australian Capital Territory - protesting at the reported moves that the Government was making to move the embassy. </para>
          <para>Indeed, I remind the House that on one occasion I took the unusual step of moving that the petition be printed. The motion was debated in this House in one sense - that I gave the reasons why the petition should be printed. It contained the expression of view of the people in Canberra, that the Government was up to something horrible and that it should be criticised for being up to it. I said that the petition should be given the widest possible distribution, that it should get into the books and that the world should know what this Government was up to. No-one on the Government benches spoke against the motion and it was carried unanimously. </para>
          <para>Opposition to what the Government was up to continued. The Minister will recall that on 11th May 1972, when he said that there was no opposition to the Government's move - 1 know he heard it because I saw his face when he read the statement out - I shouted: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. I repeat what I said: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. It was widely reported in the Canberra newspapers on the following day. If that is not opposition to the Minister's point, I do not know what it is. </para>
          <para>The Minister said m his statement that it was the Government's intention to bring in an ordinance which would fill a need in relation to the law in regard to trespass on Commonwealth land in Canberra. I do not really see any reference to Aborigines in that statement. He said finally that adequate public notice would be given of the coming into effect of the ordinance. I ' repeat, he said that adequate public notice would be given of the coming into effect of the Ordinance. What would any Opposition member want to do when told that an ordinance dealing with trespass on land could come in? The statement did not use the words 'Aborigine', 'tent' or any relevant words. ...'. </para>
          <para>I remind the Minister, when it comes to a question of his credibility, that on television he said that when the ordinance came in the Aborigines would be given a couple of weeks - a reasonable time--within which to get off the land. I heard him say it. We moved towards the end of the parliamentary session and the Minister- I ' suppose it could be argued that he -reads ' the Canberra newspapers as he is responsible for the administration of Canberra- ' will remember a Press statement I released which was given some publicity at 'the time. It said that this Government would not introduce any ordinance dealing'' with the removal of the embassy while Parliament remained in session; that it' would not be game to; that it would wait until the parliamentarians went back to Perth, </para>
          <para class="block">Brisbane, Townsville and Darwin - not that Darwin matters much in this context. The statement said that when they went back to the various parts of Australia the Government would sneak this ordinance in like a thief in the night. Is that not exactly what the Government did? </para>
          <para>Let me take the Ministery up to 20th July 1972. Rumours ran around this city that the 'Gazette' coming out on Thursday, 20th July, would contain a gazettal about the ordinance. On Thursday morning, 20th July, 1 had the officers in the legislative research section of this Parliament - very capable people - trying to tell me for an hour whether that ordinance had been gazetted. They could not find out. Do honourable members know how I found out? I was in my city office at the time and I wanted to come across to Parliament House. I got the information from an inspector of the ACT police force. In the end he said: 'If you want to know what is going on, look out your window*. He thought that I was in my office in Parliament House. When I arrived at the Aboriginal embassy the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> was there. Do honourable members know what I found? The police had dismantled the tents and there were- </para>

              <para>- That was never lost. You need not be taken away by that. Let me tell honourable members what I saw, because the Minister for the Interior had not been near the place. He talks about radical left wing elements. I saw a group of Aborigines and white people linked arm in arm around the remaining tent which carried the flag and the sign 'Aboriginal Embassy'. I recognised some of the people. I recognised the Reverend Jim Udy, a very respectable clergyman in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I recognised the Reverend George Garnsey, another very respected and responsible clergyman from Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I recognised Bruce Kent, another responsible, recognised and well known man in Canberra, linked arm in arm with the Aborigines. I saw no-one who could be called irresponsible or within any mythical conspiratorial nonsense that the Minister goes on with. At that stage the police, under the action and directions of the Minister, were proceeding to whale in. They were sooled on by the Minister, if you like, although he was not game to be there, and were pulling them away. I saw violence. </para>

          <para>This is why this House should have no confidence in the Minister. Until that time that demonstration had been the most successful peaceful symbol of the Aboriginal claim for land rights that one could possibly imagine. The Embassy had been there for 6 months and had attracted tourists. The children of tourists had gone to the Embassy and collected signatures and Aboriginal literature. The Embassy had been a peaceful symbol of the Aboriginals' claim for land rights. What did the Minister and the Government he represents do? He converted that peaceful symbol into a symbol of violence. The Minister has come along here and hypocritically made reference to Sharpeville. He talked about events 4 or 5 days later when there was an explosive situation. The peaceful symbol had been destroyed. I have enormous respect for the Australian Capital Territory police, although no-one has fought the police more than I have in the courts in previous days. But the police had been sooled on to these people by this Minister. </para>

              <para>- Put any other different word to it. There were broken limbs and skin was torn. There was violence. What else does one call it? I have spoken to some of the officers concerned. The police were deliberately disarmed. I will tell honourable members this: On the second time round when the 2,000 people assembled, the Aborigines searched each other - this is a measure of their responsibility - to ensure that there would be no arms of any sort on any of them if anything got out of control. There is a measure of responsibility for you. On that occasion we saw violence in this town that was completely unnecessary - violence that had been created and provoked by this Minister. </para>

          <para>May I give another example? That afternoon I received a message that some of the Aborigines and some of the gentlemen to whom I have already referred had gone to the police station to lend moral support to the people who had been arrested as  a  result of the fracas and who were being released on bail. I went across to the police station. There I saw the real measure of what this Minister has brought about, this transformation of a peaceful symbol into a violent symbol. I saw outside of the door of the police station 20 or 30 constables - not the 300 who had been there before. They were not standing to attention but were standing at ease. Confronting them was a very angry group of people made up of demonstrators as well as the wives and supporters of the demonstrators. There was one very young Aboriginal lady who was hysterical. She claimed that her husband had had his head bashed in, or something like that, by a policeman. These policemen are my constituents as much as are the people who go there to demonstrate. The Minister has brought about this antagonism between them. This is why I get angry. The demonstrators quite naturally were taking out their anger on the police. The people who were speaking to the demonstrators had their backs to the line of police. I refused to do that because I take the view that in this situation the police should know what you have done to them. They should know the dirty, filthy job that the Minister has given them to do. </para>

              <para>- I am not cutting it out. I am trying to tell you what the situation was. The Government nearly had a Sharpeville incident. If the moderate speakers had not poured some oil on these waters and put that fire out there would have been trouble that afternoon and this Minister could have been deliberately and directly held responsible. </para>

          <para>Let me take the story one step further, and I appreciate that my time is limited. Let me move to what happened during the following week. The responsible editor of one of Canberra's newspapers came to me towards the end of the week - about Thursday. He was not looking for a story. He came because of the responsible reports he had heard that an explosive situation was going to arise in Canberra and that the Government was doing nothing about it - it was just washing its hands like Pontius Pilate. </para>
          <para>The Minister will remember these events. I sent him a telegram because all of the reports said that he and his colleague - I suppose that one can call the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> a colleague - were in Darwin or somewhere doing something else probably quite irrelevant, given the situation that had arisen in Canberra. The reports had it that the Minister was trying to bribe off the demonstrators with the offer of Beauchamp House. After all, we remember that the thread running through the Minister's speeches has been that 'perhaps they do not want land rights; perhaps they want a club or something like that in Canberra'; or 'Perhaps if I offer them something they will go away and they will not trouble me with their unpleasant, embarrassing political demands'. So there was talk about Beauchamp House. I had a telegram from the Assistant Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ballard,</inline> on the point. Nothing was done. As the .Minister points out, there was widespread support all over this country for the Aboriginals because of the insult that this Government had laid at the door of the Aboriginal cause. Truckloads of people did come in. There was an explosive situation. </para>
          <para>On the Sunday when the 300-odd police were outside Parliament House every responsible and respected citizen : of Canberra, also was there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jim</inline> Pead of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council was there doing his best to try to talk to the responsible officers in the Department and the police. There was Professor Hal Wootten down from Sydney who was doing his best. I was there, as well as many of the members of the Advisory Council, doing our best. Where was this Minister? He was nowhere to be seen. We had this explosive situation. </para>

              <para>- That could be so. There was anger - terrible anger. But to their credit, the police kept their cool. When the demonstrators arrived marching, there was then a strong element of what I suppose loosely could be called black power people. The clenched fist salute was given and chants for land rights could be heard. This type of activity was not present before this Minister put the police in to move the Embassy away in the way he did. A peaceful demonstration had been converted to a symbol of violence which will now be associated forever with this Government and with the Aborigine's cause. The demonstrators sat down and they were addressed by their own people. </para>

              <para>- I am indebted to the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> The people sat down. Perhaps there were 2,000 of them. Having marched all the way from the Australian National University they heard speeches. Not one word of violence was uttered. The Minister talks about trouble makers and the radicals. I was there and I did not hear or see any of them. The Minister was not there. I say to the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> that they played a guitar and sang songs. They talked about the cause of Aborigines and the cause of land rights. I spoke to the Commissioner of Police who was doing his best because he did not quite know what had happened. I spoke to Hal Wootten, who said - and I am sure that he will not mind me saying so in this context - that all his efforts had left him with a feeling of frustration. He said that he could get no sense out of the Government It was as though they had turned their backs, closed their eyes and said: 'We do not know what is going to happen; we have no way of controlling it; we will just walk away from the thing*. Anyone who was there on that day will confirm what I am saying. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As  the  Minister has said, word was conveyed  to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> the Commissioner of Police, that the demonstrators would march back  to the  Australian National University. They did. He was told that a token force would remain within the tent but that there would  be  no trouble. He was told that the police could remove the tent. The police did. They found 5 or 6 men in the tent with their fingers raised in the Churchill V for Victory sign. Here was your violence. When  the  tent was taken away from around them they held up a symbolic piece of canvas, walked to where the police line was, threw it down and walked away. If that is not self-discipline, I do not know what is. What hypocrisy it was for 'the Minister to suggest in the letter which he wrote to me on 4th August that all of the credit for the absence of violence goes to the Australian Capital Territory police. Full marks to the Australian Capital Territory police. But I say full marks also to those demonstrators and no marks at all for the Minister or for this Government whom he represents. There are many reasons why this House should have no confidence in the Minister. The first is his dishonesty about the strong suggestion in the television programme when he said that he knew that the Ordinance was to be gazetted at a time when the Parliament would not be sitting. I will read the Minister's words to him if he will just listen and not wander away. He will remember that shortly after the violent removal of the tent on 20th July he was interviewed on television and it was put to him: 'Would you rather that this would have happened when the Parliament was sitting?' The Minister had been referring to how he had announced the intention to Parliament on 11th May. I already have put to the House what he said on that day - that adequate public notice would be given. Ten minutes public notice was given. When the Minister was talking to this interviewer about how on 11th May he had made an announcement to the Parliament the questioner asked: 'Would you rather that this would have happened when the Parliament was sitting?' The Minister's answer was: Well, I knew that this was not going to happen and this is why I felt obliged to inform the Parliament of the Government's decision on 11th May'. </para>
          <para>So on 11th May he knew he was going to wait until after the politicians had dispersed before slipping this Ordinance through in the way in which he did. One might ask why he waited. I suggest that it was because he could not face up to it at that stage and he misled the Parliament when he said that adequate notice would be given. </para>
          <para>I have told the House that I could not find out whether the Ordinance had been gazetted on that Thursday morning. The honourable member for Wills could not find out; I could not find out. I got the information from an inspector of police who was not unsympathetic to the cause of the demonstrators. In his interview the Minister said: 'it is interesting to note not one member of the Labor Party, the Opposition, at that time, from either the House of Representatives or the Senate objected to the Government's intention'. What rubbish! I have already referred to the long history of opposition, the petitions that have been presented to the Parliament, the telegrams sent to the Minister, the Press statements dealing with the subject and finally, to my shouting of: 'Shame! You frightened little men'. That is exactly what honourable members opposite are. I hurled those words across the chamber at the Minister. He heard them because he looked at me when he heard them. </para>
          <para>There should be no confidence in the Minister because of the dishonesty, the lack of tolerance and the hypocrisy underlying the whole situation and, finally, because of sheer incompetence. On this point I should like to conclude by reading what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox said in dealing with the challenge made to the legality of this Ordinance. I have a copy of the transcript of the judgment. The learned judge - one would think quite an objective, independent person - at page 24 of the transcript, referring to this way of making laws, particularly laws which affect the lives of people, but laws generally in Canberra, said: </para>
          <para> You would not take long to convince me that section 12- </para>
          <para class="block">That is the section of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act under which this type of legislation is enacted - is an unsatisfactory scheme of legislation. There are plenty of other examples of the same kind of comment from the judge in his judgment. At page 96 of the transcript he said: lt seems to me on the material presently before me that the position was that the Embassy and those constituting the Embassy could lawfully have been required to leave land under the principles of the general law and without the aid of the ordinance. As I see the matter if it in fact had been necessary the responsible authorities could have applied to this court for appropriate orders to achieve their desired results. </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister has spoken about the legal advice he was given. But I remind the Minister that the learned judge said: </para>
          <para>As I understand him, counsel who appears for both the Minister and the Commissioner of Police does not dispute that some such course was available under the general law. </para>
          <para class="block">In saying that the judge was referring to the Minister's own counsel who appeared in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and who said that the embassy could have been removed under the existing law without this Ordinance. I ask the Minister: 'Where is your legal advice now?' Is that not incompetence? For these reasons I support the motion. </para>

            <para>-  It is a pity that the important issues of this debate which were set out by the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> have been obscured by that hysterical outburst we have just witnessed from the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby).</inline> The honourable member threw, across the floor of this House, a number of wild accusations which are completely irrelevant to the main issues which we should be discussing. I intend to deal with only one of them, namely, the accusation that the police of the Australian Capital Territory were sooled on by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> The honourable member should know quite well that the responsibility for administering the law in the Australian Capital Territory lies solely with the police. In this matter . the police were carrying out their duties and any thought that a Minister was sooling on the police I think needs to be scotched right at the start! This is an accusation that the honourable member should retract if he has any decency. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think there are 2 issues that need to be examined. They were raised by the. honourable member for Fremantle. The first concerns the use of the lawns in front of Parliament House and the second is the question of protest by Aboriginal  people  here and in other parts of Australia'. The first involves the responsibility of the Minister for the Interior and is the subject of this no confidence motion.'  AfteV  what we have heard from the Minister for the Interior I think that this House should have every confidence in him for ,the way in which, in a very difficult situation,, he has acted with full integrity and full, probity. He has from me and all members on this side of the House full confidence  in  what he has undertaken, namely, the maintaining of the law in respect of the use of the lawns of Parliament House. </para>
          <para>The other matter to which I think I should direct my attention concerns protests and the needs and aspirations of the Aboriginal people and the aid that this Commonwealth Government should be giving to them at this stage of our history. The honourable member for Fremantle knows full well that he, the hononourable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Luchetti),</inline> many other honourable members and I were present during the survey carried out in 1961 from which we saw that there is this socio-economic dilemma of ethnic minority groups as part of a world-wide phenomenon. It is not something for which any of us can prescribe easy solutions, but what we have clearly stated as a Commonwealth Government is that we have an objective towards which we are moving, namely, to create in Australia a single society while at the same time recognising the disparate history of ethnic, cultural and spiritual characteristics of the Australian community. But we do wish to move towards one single society. That is the aim of the Government and it is towards that aim that I think we should address ourselves. </para>
          <para>One thing that I have been endeavouring to do as Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts is to improve the dialogue between the Government and the Aboriginal people. For too long there have been various solutions and slogans, and so-called representatives of the Aboriginal people, both European and Aboriginal, putting forward their views. However, it has been difficult at any one time to assess what are the real needs of Aboriginal people in Australia at the present time and to determine how we will achieve a degree of integration into the general society in which we live? The needs and the problems are not uniform throughout Australia. The needs of people in the capital cities, the people who have moved out of their old Aboriginal situations into European situations in the cities, are obviously very different from the needs of people still in the tribal areas in the north. So, it has been for this purpose that for the last few months I have been endeavouring to call together a conference of as widely rep resentative groups of Aboriginal people as possible in order to start that dialogue between the Government and the Aborigines. It has not been easy. For some time I asked the Council for Aboriginal Affairs to seek the best available means of calling together that national conference. But we succeeded and last week this conference was held. I think it is known that that conference was free to ask advice, and to receive submissions, from any source it wished to consult. It was open to the Press and its deliberations received wide publicity. I have received from that conference a series of 39 resolutions and I think the House knows that I am in the process of considering them. I hope and believe that that conference is the embryo of a continuing process of dialogue and meaningful discussion between the Government and the Aboriginal people. That is something which has not existed in the past. </para>
          <para>Having stated how I believe we shall be able to understand these needs more closely, I now wish to inform the House of what has taken place while I have been Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. In spite of the slighting remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle, I believe a very great deal has been done over the past few months. </para>

              <para>- Let me deal with my actions as a Minister. As these important matters have been raised let me refer to the important decisions we have made respecting land for Aborigines. Three important moves were announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> on 26th January. The first dealt with the creation of general purpose leases, leases to apply to land on reserves in the Northern Territory, and leases to be granted to Aboriginal communities which have the intention and ability to develop the land on which they are living for economic and social purposes, ensuring, at the same time, that those applications do not interfere with other groups which may be living close to them at that time. The important thing is that there has been no change of policy for those people living on reserves in the </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Northern Territory who wish to continue with the present use that they are making of their land. That new policy was announced for those who wish to make new uses of the land. Many groups already have applied for these leases and I believe, therefore, that this first policy is fulfilling a need felt by the Aboriginal people living on reserves at this time, particularly in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>Secondly, for those people living off reserves, the Government announced its policy of purchasing areas of land, pastoral properties, as they become available for the use of Aboriginal people. It is well known that I am in the process of negotiating for a number of these properties, both in the Northern Territory and in the States. We have appropriated $13m to underwrite this programme over the 5-year period. </para>

The matter with which he has been dealing is one that we on this s&lt;ide of the chamber would welcome as the subject of a general debate, namely, the administration of Aborigines by his Department. However, on the issue that is before us he is particularly wide of the mark. </para>

              <para>- My remarks relate to the purpose of the protests outside the House, the matter which we are discussing, and are directed to the use of land by Aboriginal people. Therefore it is right that the policy of the Government on this matter should be widely disseminated. 1 wish also to deal with Aboriginal sacred sites and sites of special significance because this goes to the heart of the matter. The protests related to the question of land rights and it is that policy that we are debating. Therefore I think the House should be cognisant of it. The Government has said that it shall endeavour as soon as possible to preserve and delineate for all time the use of those special sacred sites for Aboriginal people. This was part of the policy announced on 26th January. I asked the Institute of Aboriginal Studies to convene a gathering in order to find nut best- </para>

              <para>- If land rights is one of the matters that has been the subject of protest by a group of people on the lawns outside Parliament House then it is hi order, and more than in order, for the Government to make clear what progress it has made in delineating and dealing with the subject of land rights for Aboriginal people, particularly as they affect the sacred sites that have been of so much importance during the history of this embassy. We have been dealing with some of the major factors about which there have been protests in the last few months. Having done that, it is right therefore that these policies should be clearly set out in a debate on the subject of confidence in the Minister for the Interior. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Let me make this clear: If there is to be protest about the way in which the Government has been handling the affairs of the Aboriginal people, particularly since the Government took over control and responsibility for the Aboriginal people as a result of the referendum in 1967, then it is right that the House and the Australian people should know how much we have done. In the last year governments in Australia spent $44m of the taxpayers funds on behalf of the 140,000 Aboriginal people in Australia. That has happened since we took over this responsibility in 1968, and before the present financial year the Commonwealth Government had allocated $68m for this purpose. Much of this money has been spent on helping with housing, in providing hostels and in providing employment, particularly rural employment. So much has been done during the past few years. We have gone out of our way to improve the education of the Aboriginal people. Today there are 4,000 scholarships in use by Aborigines throughout Australia. In the Northern Territory alone 75 per cent of eligible Aboriginal children attend pre-schools, 90 per cent attend primary school and 70 per cent attend secondary school. A tremendous amount of development has occurred since the Commonwealth took over these responsibilities. </para><para>In addition there are the capital funds with which we have helped people in private enterprise. Through the provision of grants totalling over $2.25m new enterprises are being carried out for the Aboriginal people. I make it clear that the Government has done a tremendous amount for the Aboriginal people. In spite of the protests I believe that our record is clear and that we have acted responsibly. We. aim to do more but we shall not be able to state a lot more of what we are doing if a lot of these hysterical red herrings are thrown about this House in this way at this time. </para><para>The real issue today is: Has the Minister for the Interior acted responsibly and has he justified the confidence of the House? I believe that not only has he the confidence of this House but also, for what we have been doing in the field of the Aboriginal people, he should receive the plaudits of this House and of the people of Australia. </para></speech>

            <para>- I support the motion of no confidence in the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> for a whole range of reasons which I propose to place before the Parliament, although the time allowed for us is somewhat limited. The Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> introduced the general question of Aboriginal administration. Before getting on to the major subject of debate I would like to say that notwithstanding the fact that some things are being done by the Commonwealth Government, the Australian Labor Party has held all along that what we are doing now can be summed up as being too little; that it is not being done after proper and regular consultation with the Aboriginal people and after considering the priorities that they themselves help to determine, and that it is wrongly motivated. I was interested in the comment made by the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts about the Government's aim to create a single society in Australia. I do not quite know what that means. I suppose it is the logical follow through from a policy of assimilation. While we all recognise that most of the Aboriginal people of Australia will probably choose to be assimilated into our society, as a great number of them have, the Labor Party recognises the right of those Aborigines who choose to stay in their own communities to do so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We look with interest to the 39 resolutions that came out of the conference last week. I was interested to see that the Minister did not quote one of those conference resolutions that actually referred to the Aboriginal embassy. That brings us back to square one. The closing remarks of the Minister for the Interior were that this embassy and various things associated with it had served the political objectives of certain sections of the Labor Party. What was the Aboriginal embassy? The Aboriginal embassy arose out of an initiative of some young people associated with the Aboriginal legal service at Redfern in Sydney. It was an expression of their frustration with the failure of this Government and other governments throughout Australia to acknowledge the legitimate land rights of the Aboriginal people. It is well known that the government in this country has never acknowledged the land rights of the Aborigines in the way in which the land rights of the Red Indians of Canada and the United States of America and the land rights of the indigenous populations of South America and other places were acknowledged by the respective colonial governments. It was an Aboriginal initiative. </para>
          <para>It has been said that the embassy was not a very presentable sight. One has to realise that it was an Aboriginal initiative. It was situated in tents which the Aborigines could afford to buy, to erect and to maintain. It was a modest expression. But the important question is what it meant to the Aboriginal people of Australia. It was a symbol of their fight for land rights. It was a protest against the failure of this Government to understand what land means to the Australian Aborigines. One can go back to the Boyer lectures by Professor Stanner a few years ago. He explained this probably better than any other person has explained it. It was a protest at the failure of the Government to meet these needs. The Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts spoke about the Government's plans. One has to realise the great frustrations that occur when one sees the shemozzle over a situation like that of Everard Park where there was a difference between the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of the Interior as to the actual form of title the land would take. These are the things that frustrate the Aborigines, as they frustrate many people on this side of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>There has been a continued failure of effective consultation. One of the things that emerged out of this confrontation was that Ministers of the Crown really do not understand the wishes, the aims and the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. When Aborigines stand up to fight for something it is immediately suspected that they are being manipulated by other people. That is the suggestion that comes through straightaway. Having a conference from time to time every year or two is a hollow gesture. There needs to be effective consultation at a more local level. There needs to be more staff in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and these people need to be better supported. There is a major failure in the consultative process. I am not attacking the officers of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs who do this. I am speaking from the Aborigines' point of view. They sit down and talk to these people. They know that the liaison officers go back to Canberra and put in a report. Then there are interminable delays brought about by the bureaucracy. Eventually the Aborigines may get something, or they may get nothing. Consider the point of view of members of an Aboriginal committee sitting around a table in some part of Australia. Their hopes are raised. They put up a case. They get very little, and sometimes nothing at all. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the people who were at the conference. The Minister said that there were negotiations with  a  range of people. He mentioned Joe McGinness. He mentioned the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and myself. It is true that we approached the Minister to see whether we could come out with some negotiated settlement or arrangement to give the Aboriginal people a lobby in Canberra. Those negotiations were frustrated when Cabinet decided, instead of allowing this to proceed through some peaceful process of negotiation, to have  a  confrontation. Cabinet, at the request of the Minister for the Interior, made a decision that the Aboriginal embassy would go. How could the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders or any other Aboriginal organisation continue to negotiate under those circumstances? FCAATSI would have been accused by every young militant Aboriginal in Australia of selling out the cause of Aboriginal land rights for the lease of land in Canberra. That is looking at it from the Aboriginal point of view. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the people who were there. A small group of students came. There was a great turnover of people at the Aboriginal embassy. It was a very modest protest but it became a major symbol in the eyes of the Aboriginal people. The very attractive colour photograph on the front page of the last edition of 'Identity', the publication of the Aboriginal Publications Foundation, featured the Aboriginal Embassy as a symbol of the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. The protest was winding down. The Government made the protest a more effective protest by its own precipitate action. Then young Aboriginal people and many young people who were not Aboriginals came to support the Aboriginal Embassy. I had some discussions with a group of young people at the University of Queensland. I went out there for another purpose - to talk about the Budget, as a matter of fact, real or imaginary. Some of these young people said: 'We are going to Canberra. Are you coming?' I explained that I was not going. They said they were going to Canberra to support the Aboriginal cause. I said: 'By all means support the Aboriginal cause, but we do not want violence.' They said: 'We have been making decisions for the Aboriginal people of this country for a long time. We are going down on the basis that the decision on what happens down there will be made by a black caucus. We are going to let the Aboriginal people make their own decisions.' Many young people came from all parts of Australia with that point of view in mind. </para>
          <para>I would like to repudiate the suggestion that anyone on this side of the House had a vested interest in stirring up violence. Not only from the point of view of the Aboriginal people of Australia but also from the aspect of Australia's standing in the eyes of the world, we all had a vested interest in seeing that there was a minimum of violence or no violence at all. I know what the honourable member for Wills and I did in talking to people from Aboriginal organisations in various parts of Australia. There was similar action by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Noone opposed a demonstration in Canberra. No-one opposed a peaceful demonstration. All of us would have supported it but none of us would have supported violence. We are concerned about this situation for a number of reasons. One is the obvious failure, of the Minister for the. Interior and his colleagues to understand the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. The Minister carries the burden of responsibility for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. Other reasons are the obvious, complete failure by the Government to recognise the just claims for land rights and the hollow gestures that have been made. All of this resulted in a confrontation. It is for these reasons that the Labor Party has advanced this censure motion today. </para>

            <para>- The motion before us is that the House has no confidence in the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> because of his handling of the dispute in removing the tent city outside Parliament House. That is the only motion before us. As an honourable member on the other side said, it has nothing to do with land rights and nothing to do with anything other than the Minister's propriety in handling the erection of tents in front of Parliament House. The Minister is attacked on 2 grounds, apparently: Firstly, that he removed those tents and, secondly, the way in which he removed them. I want to examine them separately because 1 believe this to be the fact: Either the lawns in front of Parliament House are a public preserve or they are a preserve on which people can erect tents, park caravans, sleep in sleeping bags and do anything of that kind which they like. They are one or the other. If they are to be areas which are reserved for the public, which the public can walk over and enjoy and on which the public can exercise their rights, then the rights of the public will be infringed if any organisation is allowed to set up tents, to park caravans or in any other way to impede the rights of the public on those reserves. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the instance which is under discussion the rights of the public were definitely infringed on one occasion when some members of the public were moved on from the vicinity of the King George V Memorial by some of the individuals who were camped in the tents outside Parliament House. Clearly if these lawns are to be preserved - I believe they should be, otherwise we will have a tent city in which any organisation can erect a tent and this would be an unsanitary and unhealthy public eyesore and would obstruct the rights of the public - action has to be taken. Either they are public lawns or they are areas on which people can park. If they are to be areas on which people can park, then anybody can erect a tent city whether they are Aborigines or members of the Returned Services League or the Country Women's Association. I believe that the Minister would move any of them on and I believe that he would be right in doing so. 1 am sure that he would move them on even if they were members of the Victorian Farmers Union. He would be entirely right to do so because either no organisation or person is entitled to park and erect tents there or any organisation or person is entitled to park and erect tents there, <inline font-style="italic">lt they were entitled to do</inline> this it would create absolute chaos. I believe th.it on the first count the Minister was entirely right, in protecting the public interest, in removing this tent city not because it was anything to do with Aborigines but because he should have done so no matter whom it had anything to do with. That is all I have to say on the first point of the attack on the Minister. </para>
          <para>Secondly, we are asked to believe that the way in which he carried out this duty was improper. We have heard from him. I do not believe anybody would deny the accuracy or the truth of the statements he used in his speech to the House, saying that every effort was made by him to use reason and common sense in order to ensure that there was no confrontation, as referred to by some speakers on the other side of the House, and that these reasonable approaches failed. It has never been suggested that he did not have the legal right to remove the tents whether he passed the Ordinance to which reference has been made or not. But, having this legal right and having failed in a reasonable and sensible attempt to bring about a compromise removal, he was legally bound, I believe, by his oath of office to enforce the law and to ensure that people were not allowed to park haphazardly in front of Parliament House and erect tent cities there. We can get from his own speech the whole sequence of events. </para>
          <para>The only other point I want to make on this matter is that I do not think I have ever heard a more irresponsible speech in this Parliament than that which was made by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby). His</inline> speech was an example of the most sickening double think, lt would be an irresponsible speech if it came from a layman; it is doubly irresponsible when it comes from a lawyer who has been admitted to the Bar and is required to uphold the law of which he is a servant. We have been told that violence occurred because the police were seeking to carry out their duty and that the fault lay with the police. </para>

              <para>- The suggestion by the honourable member who is interjecting from outside the House - another example of his regard for the law and the rules of the Parliament - as all who listened to him in this House and outside it will know, is that the responsibility was on the police; and he went on to say ...r.-1.., on by the Minister'. That is a shocking accusation against a Minister who was carrying out a law and ensuring that the police carried out a law. It is perfectly right and sensible for the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory to object to that law, but to stand up in this House and to attack the police and the Minister by saying that that was the cause of the violence seems to me to be something which no lawyer could possibly accept. Surely, violence does not occur because a police officer seeks to carry out the law; violence occurs only when a citizen, objecting to the law being carried out, uses violence against the servants of the public who are seeking to carry it out. That is what occurred on this occasion, it is no good speaking about who was there and how respectable they were. The violence occurred because the people concerned resisted the carrying out of the law. Here we have a lawyer - a member of this Parliament - supporting them in their resistance and turning the blame on the police who where carrying out the law which was not only the result of the Ordinance but the result of a law of the land. </para>

The 3 points that I want to reiterate before I sit down are these: Firstly, it was improper for anybody to erect a city of tents in front of Parliament House. Had this been allowed to continue we could have had nothing but a vast sea of tents from all kinds of organisations set up on the lawns in front of Parliament House. </para>

              <para>- It is quite clear, even to one with limited legal intelligence, that if one organisation could set up tents with impunity then any organisation would be able to do it with impunity. The facts should be that none should be able to do it and that none can do it because the law says so. Therefore the Minister was only carrying out his duty. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Secondly, we know that the Minister tried every reasonable means. Then, as he was bound to do, he instructed the police to carry out the law. Violence resulted not from that but from resistance to the law, which resistance is now being aided, abetted, encouraged and supported by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. In all these matters I think that any reliable, responsible person who examines the record will say that the Minister is not liable to any kind of censure and that he ought to be congratulated for carrying out the law without fear and without favour. If there is one criticism that could be made of him it is that he did not act months before and move them off much earlier, but I think that has nothing to do with him and it is not his fault. That rs not a criticism of any kind which should lead us to censure him. </para></speech>

            <para>- I move:  That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">In doing so I present the Budget for 1972- 73. </para>
          <para>Our proposals are geared to achieve social and economic goals of significance to all Australians and particularly families. The briefest portrayal of the Budget is as follows: taxes down; pensions up; and growth decisively strengthened. </para>
          <para>THE ECONOMY</para>
        <para>Over the years the Australian economy has demonstrated a growth capacity of better than 5 per cent in real terms. In 1971-72 growth was 3 per cent. We aim to step up that rate, and the Budget is designed to do so. </para>
        <para>Last year was a difficult one from both a domestic and an international viewpoint. We did well to come out of it with a growth rate of 3 per cent. The ink was hardly dry on last year's Budget before the international monetary crisis jolted world confidence severely. Its consequences for our major trading partners, particularly Japan, dampened expectations and led to capital expenditure cutbacks in the mining and other industries. These uncertainties were reinforced domestically by the continuing upsurge of wage pressures. Costs and prices rose rapidly and there was a marked setback to business confidence. The employment outlook changed quite quickly and consumers became more cautious. </para>
        <para>The impact of these developments on the economy was far from uniform. Public sector outlays grew strongly - up about 13 per cent in current prices. Exports also rose strongly - up 13 per cent. This rise has been reflected in, among other things,, a welcome lift in farm incomes. Another strong growth area has been housing. Last year 146,000 new dwellings were commenced - up 6 per cent. The upward trend quickened in the second half of the year. </para>
      <para>That is one side of the coin. The other is to be seen in the weakness in consumer spending and in business investment. </para>
      <para>For the year, consumer spending at constant prices rose by about 3 per cent. A variety of reasons has been advanced. Personal borrowing for the purchase of consumer durables fell off and savings ran high. A natural consumer resistance to higher prices seems to have played a role. And, although money wages have been rising rapidly, the increasing bite of the progressive personal income tax scale has combined with rising prices to restrict severely growth in the real purchasing power of take-home pay. Single income families, especially those with children, have been particularly hard hit. </para>
      <para>This slackness in consumer spending has been basic to the economy's lack of punch. Our first objective in this Budget, therefore, is to create conditions conducive to stronger consumer spending. </para>
      <para>Business investment, too, has been nagging. In part, this reflects some decline, perhaps inevitable, in expectations in the mining industry. Some tailing away has also occurred in the strong boom that has been running in some sectors of construction although there has been a recent upturn in building approvals. But in manufacturing industry particularly, an important underlying cause has been slack demand. As consumer demand picks up, investment in those areas will pick up also. </para>
      <para>We have, of course, already taken progressive action to steer the economy back to a proper course. Monetary conditions have been made easier and interest rates brought down. Public sector spending was boosted at the Premiers' Conferences in February and June. In April the basic social services and repatriation pensions were increased and the ongoing rate of personal income tax levy was reduced from 5 per cent to 21 per cent. All of these measures are playing their part. But the economy has proved hard to budge from its too-subdued growth path. </para>
      <para>This lagging response is evident in the labour market. At the end of July, 2 per cent of the work-force, after seasonal adjustment, was registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service. This figure compares well with almost any other developed country today. But it is too high for us, and we are determined to reduce it. </para>
      <para>The other great problem with which we have had to contend is the continuing upward pressure on costs and prices. Over the past 3 years the consumer price index rose at an annual average rate of 5 per cent, while earnings rose on average by 10 per cent annually. The wage and price rises during this time have been the highest since the Korean war boom. The resulting heightening of inflationary expectations has been only too evident. This process had to be stopped and reversed. </para>
      <para>I am glad to say that the heightening tendency has been stopped and there are even some signs that a reversal may be in train. These are early days. But certainly, the price indices themselves have slowed somewhat in their upward rush. The consumer price index increased by 7 per cent in the year to the last December quarter. In the year to the June quarter of 1972 the increase, while still far too high at 6.1 per cent, was at least appreciably less. </para>
      <para>It remains to be seen whether this is merely a temporary departure from the earlier trend or a pointer to a new one. Pressures for more frequent and ever-larger increases in money wages remain. While they do, the evils of inflation will persist. </para>
      <para>In many past years, budget policy has been inhibited by balance of payments considerations. That is not so this year. Booming exports and a record level of capital inflow have contributed to a large surplus in the balance of payments. The Government is currently reviewing policies in relation to certain aspects of capital inflow into Australia. </para>
      <para>To summarise: the economy at present is moving in the right direction. A modest abatement of inflationary trends has been achieved. Demand, although patchy, is growing. Confidence generally has improved in recent months. There is, however, some slack in the economy and in the absence of further action it would be some time before it was fully taken up. </para>
        <para>PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES</para>
      <para class="block">In looking at the year ahead the Government has had in mind a number of considerations. </para>
      <para>First, although there is some slack in the economy, it would be irresponsible to provide such a strong budgetary stimulus that a renewed inflationary boom was created. We want to see the rate of growth stepped up considerably. But with liquidity already very high and certain to rise higher, and with prices still rising by around 5 per cent per annum, to go further would be foolhardy. </para>
      <para>Secondly, for some time now public sector spending has run ahead very fast, with private sector spending lagging. There are important needs served by our public expenditures but there are also costs - whether from the viewpoint of the individual taxpayer, who finds taxation more and more a burden, or of the private sector as a whole, which finds its room for growth constrained. </para>
      <para>It is central to our objectives that the needed stimulus to the economy should not be by way of an excessive growth of Commonwealth expenditures. We have sought as much scope as possible for reducing the burden of taxation. That has been our primary aim and I believe we have achieved it. </para>
      <para>Thirdly, in framing our proposals we have selected measures which provide a boost to private sector spending, but also new initiatives with longer-term objectives. </para>
      <para>Finally, we have also been determined to find room for measures having merit on broader grounds of social welfare and equity. </para>
      <para class="block">I come now to our expenditure proposals. </para>
        <para>EXPENDITURE</para>
      <para>The forward estimates of expenditure, the implementation of which I announced last year, have proved helpful. Accordingly, we will continue with the further development and application of the forward estimates procedures. </para>
      <para>A detailed analysis of the expenditure estimates is set out in the accompanying Statements. In total, expenditures are estimated to increase this year by $ 1,045m or 11.6 per cent to $10,078m. This is virtually the same rate of increase as occurred last year. </para>
      <para class="block">Payments to the States </para>
      <para>Payments to the States constitute the largest single element in the Commonwealth's expenditures. Including funds to finance State works and housing programmes, they are estimated to increase by $395m, to $3,449m. </para>
      <para>At the June Premiers' Conference we increased the financial assistance grants by an extra $128m, of which SI 24.5m escalates under the formula. </para>
      <para>Total general revenue assistance, including special grants recommended by the Grants Commission, is estimated at $ 1,692m. Adjusting for the transfer of pay-roll tax, the estimated increase is about $280m. </para>
      <para>State works and housing programmes at $892m, including $248.5m in grants, are $90m greater. This will provide a significant boost to State capital expenditure. </para>
      <para>Specific purpose payments for purposes such as roads, schools and universities are expected to increase by 24 per cent to $775m. </para>
        <para>NATIONAL HIGHWAYS</para>
      <para>We will provide up to $2.5m over 4 years to South Australia for completion of the sealing of the Eyre Highway. This demonstrates our interest in seeing adequate progress in the development pf highways which serve as major interstate links. </para>
      <para>We will develop in consultation with the States a suitable programme for further improvement of the national highway system, to be an integral part of the general arrangements for assistance to the States for roads beyond June 1974 when the present Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation expires. $250,000 is provided this year for investigations and planning to develop such a programme. </para>
          <para>Defence</para>
        <para>There is a requirement to develop defence forces with a greater independent capability so that we may be more selfreliant in protecting our own interests and in dealing with lesser military situations. There is also a requirement to intensify our defence understandings with our neighbours as a contribution to confidence and stability in the region. In addition, there is a need to maintain our understanding with the United States to provide a foundation of Australian security in the contingency of threats or actual attack going beyond Australian capacity to deal with alone. </para>
        <para>Even after allowance for the reduction in National Service, the Defence Vote proposed is SI, 323m - SI 06m more than expenditure last year. Additional Estimates may well be needed for Forces' pay and allowances when the recommendations of the Woodward Committee of Inquiry are received. </para>
        <para>Expenditure proposed for capital equipments is $200m compared with $140m last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Major equipments</inline> to be delivered this year include the initial batch of 6 F111C aircraft and initial deliveries of medium-lift helicopters. Provision has been made for the refitting of HMAS Vendetta and for the RAN hydrographic ship which is due for completion in early 1973. </para>
        <para>New capital equipments will be ordered this year. Chief among these are 3 destroyers, with ancillary helicopters, at a total estimated project cost, in 1972 prices, of $355m. The expenditure will be spread over a decade. Expenditure this year for strategic bases, service accommodation and other defence facilities is $5 7m. $ 1,065m is for non-capital expenditure - up $42m. The increase reflects price and wage increases. </para>
          <para>Assistance to Industry</para>
        <para>Details are given in Statement No. 9. </para>
        <para>Assistance under the export incentive scheme is expected to total S68m  -  up $9m. </para>
        <para>There will be a substantial increase in assistance to the shipbuilding industry. The net amount provided is $3 3. 7m, up $20.3m. </para>
        <para>Payments to rural industries are estimated to total $233m compared with $297m last year, and $2 1 Om in 1970-71. </para>
        <para>The decrease is due largely to the lower requirement expected for wool deficiency payments, now that wool prices have improved. As already announced, the Government has decided to extend the deficiency payments scheme for wool-growers until 30tb June 1973 on 'the same basis as in 1971-72. </para>
        <para>Following the Government-sponsored two year programme of research and commercial trials on pre-sale objective measurement of wool, a further allocation of $700,000 is made for research, implementation and development. Also provided is $27m towards the cost of financing the joint industry-Government wool research and promotion programmes. Other wool marketing assistance includes $4.2m towards the costs involved in handling wool included in the Price Averaging Plan. </para>
        <para>Expenditure under the wheat industry stabilisation scheme in respect of exports from the 1971-72 crop is expected to be $47m. Last year expenditure was $58ra and included payments for both the 1969-70 and 1970-71 crops. </para>
        <para>A new five-year stabilisation plan for the dairy industry commenced on 1st July 1972. Under the plan the level of government assistance is determined each year in the light of the needs and circumstances of the industry. The amount for bounty on butter and cheese in 1972-73 is $28. 5m. </para>
        <para>The Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy Act which is due to expire on 31st October 1972 will be continued until 31st December 1974. Expenditure this year is estimated at $10m. </para>
        <para>S56m, the whole of the balance of the $100m originally intended for expenditure over 4 years, is provided in the estimates this year for the continuation of the rural reconstruction scheme. We have agreed to provide a further SI 5m to finance assistance approved in the latter part of 1972-73 but carried over for payment in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that $4m will be paid to the States under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. </para>
        <para>A fruit growing reconstruction scheme, supplementary to the main rural reconstruction scheme, will be introduced. $4.6m will be provided to assist the removal of surplus trees by growers of canning peaches and pears, and fresh apples and pears, who are in financial difficulties. Expenditure of $2m is expected this year. </para>
        <para>The new scheme will take time to come fully into effect. Meanwhile, the fresh apple and pear industry is facing a particularly unfavourable situation and we will provide special short-term assistance. The maximum quantity of apples and pears which may attract the maximum payment under the stabilisation scheme is to be raised by 500,000 bushels for 1972 exports only. The provision for payments by the Commonwealth in 1972-73 has been increased to $3,150,000. </para>
        <para>Subject to the proviso that all mainland State Governments will implement production controls, we will provide a onceandforall grant of $750,000 to the egg industry to help sustain producer returns while the present large stocks of egg pulp are being cleared. </para>
        <para>The campaign to eradicate bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis will be intensified. </para>
        <para class="block">Subject to agreement with the mainland States to provide funds on a $ for $ basis, the Commonwealth will increase its contributions to $4m - up SI. 6m on last year. Additional expenditures of $360,000 in the Commonwealth Territories will be provided if required this year. </para>
        <para>RURAL LENDING FACILITIES</para>
      <para class="block">After an intensive review of the long term credit facilities available to farmers, the Government has come to the view that there are deficiencies. The Budget provides a sum of $20m to be appropriated for purposes of facilitating the increased availability to farmers of long-term loans. The measures to be adopted have still to be finalised; the intention is to bring down legislation in this session of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Advances for Capital Purposes</para>
        <para>Advances for capital purposes will increase by $29m to $522m. </para>
        <para>There is a reduction in the advance to Qantas. Last year Qantas received $74.2m in overseas loans for aircraft acquisition - this year it is receiving $11. 6m, plus $2 5m additional share capital. </para>
        <para>The Australian National Airlines Commission is to be advanced $ 13.4m for aircraft purchases. The Commission is also being advanced $25m to assist it to introduce new accounting arrangements for superannuation. There is an offsetting receipt of $21m from the Commission. </para>
        <para>The capital of the Australian Industry Development Corporation has been increased by a further $12. 5m to a total of $50m. </para>
        <para>Capital of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation will be increased from $4m to $8m. </para>
        <para>An advance of $288m is provided for the Post Office. After allowance for special factors this is an increase of over 11 per cent. </para>
          <para>Other Capital Works and Services</para>
        <para>Expenditure on other capital works and services is estimated at $264m, slightly less than last year. A number of major new projects will be commenced this year, but expenditure on them in 1972-73 will be relatively small. The major items involved relate to community welfare and municipal service projects, principally in the mainland territories. </para>
        <para>The near completion of projects to extend and up-grade airport runways at both Melbourne and Sydney will result in an estimated $17m less being spent this year on civil aviation works. </para>
        <para>Following an agreement with the South Australian Government we will construct a railway from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The total cost is estimated at $54m at current prices. Expenditure of S3. 4m is expected this year. </para>
        <para>New computing facilities for the Department of Customs and Excise will cost $1.6m this year. </para>
          <para>Departmental Running Expenses</para>
        <para>The rapid increases in wage and salary payments in 1971-72 are reflected in the estimated increase of $62m or about 10 per cent in departmental running expenses. There was an additional public service payday in 1971-72 - the increase this year would otherwise have been larger. </para>
        <para>Rapid increases in departmental running expenses cannot go on unfettered without effects on the resources available to pursue other government policies. Last year I announced a review of existing functions and activities of departments. This review has not yet been completed. Its benefits are expected to emerge in the longer term. </para>
        <para>The rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees have been increased. The lump sum payment for death will be $14,500 and the weekly incapacity rate will be $43 for a single man, $11 for a wife and $5 for each dependant child. The new rates will apply from the date of Royal Assent to the enabling legislation. </para>
        <para>GRANTS TO ORGANISATIONS</para>
      <para class="block">$5. 7m will be provided for the Performing Aru; - an increase of $l.5m. Assistance for Art, Literature, Film and Composition will be $1.7m. $950,000 will be paid to the Australian Film Development Corporation. </para>
      <para>Assistance to the National Fitness movement in the triennium commencing 1st July 1972 will be increased. The yearly operational grant, now $350,000, becomes $500,000. The total capital grant, over the triennium, now $200,000, becomes $300,000. </para>
      <para>The annual grant to the Australian Conservation Foundation will be increased from $50,000 to $150,000. A grant of $20,000 is being made to the Keep Australia Beautiful Council. The Australian ' Council of National Trusts will receive an additional $50,000 a year. The grants to the Surf Life Saving Association and the Royal Life Saving Society will be increased from $34,000 to $50,000 per annum in each case. An annual grant of $5,500 is to be made to the National Council of Women. </para>
        <para>ROAD SAFETY</para>
      <para class="block">In addition to the annual grant to the States of $150,000 for road safety promomotion, the Budget provides $575,000 for direct Commonwealth expenditure on road safety promotion and research, an increase of $175,000. </para>
        <para>ASSISTANCE FOR TOURIST ATTRACTIONS</para>
      <para class="block">An approach has been made to the States seeking their agreement to a programme of development of tourist attractions - such as Australiana and pioneer settlements, the preservation of historic sites and buildings, fauna sanctuaries and the like - considered to have particular appeal to overseas visitors to this country. The Commonwealth will match expenditure by the States $ for $ up to a total Commonwealth expenditure of Sim annually. $250,000 may be needed in 1972-73. </para>
        <para>ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT</para>
      <para class="block">Aggregate expenditure on Aboriginal advancement in 1972-73, including payments from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, is expected to be $53. 2m - up $2 1.9m or 70 per cent. Grants to the States for expenditure by them on housing, health, education and other programmes will increase by 58 per cent to $ 1 4.5m. An amount of $5m will be available in 1972-73 for the acquisition of properties off reserves, and $3.7m is being provided for the Aboriginal Secondary and Study Grants schemes. The Northern Territory Administration expects to spend $24.6m on Aboriginal advancement in 1972-73, an increase of S9m or 58 per cent. </para>
        <para>INDUSTRIAL TRAINING</para>
      <para class="block">Because a skilled work-force plays a critical part in improving productivity, the Government will continue its policy of stimulating industry to improve the quality of training. </para>
      <para>We intend to introduce a cash subsidy scheme to promote the training of apprentices. </para>
      <para>Two new employment training schemes are proposed - one to extend training assistance to persons made redundant and the other to enable persons with a history of unemployment to acquire job skills which are in demand. We shall increase the level of subsidy to employers under the employment training scheme for Aborigines. </para>
      <para>We also propose to further encourage the employment and training of training specialists. </para>
      <para>The total estimated cost of these new initiatives for 1972-73 is $1.9m and, in a full year, $4.7m. </para>
        <para>ASSISTANCE WITH FARES</para>
      <para class="block">The Government has decided that unemployed persons should not be inhibited in seeking employment by the cost of fares, and will be asking the States for their cooperation in developing a viable scheme. </para>
      <para>The estimated cost in 1972-73 is $200,000. </para>
      <para>Details of this and the training proposals will be given by the Minister for Labour and National Service. </para>
        <para>IMMIGRATION</para>
      <para class="block">The steady growth of Australia's population continues to be a major goal of policy. Our economic development and growth as a nation for 25 years has owed very much to our success in attracting migrants. We must continue those active migration policies which have been serving us so well. Accordingly, the Government has decided, on the basis of the economy's likely needs and the availability of suitable settlers, that the immigration programme for 1972-73 should be 140,000. Assisted passages will be provided for 90,000 at a cost of $29.6m. </para>
      <para>Increasing emphasis is to be placed on migrant counselling and selection, and on English language training and migrant wel fare services. Additional expenditure this year is S3. 2m. The Minister for Immigration will give details. </para>
        <para>EXTERNAL AID</para>
      <para class="block">In relative <inline font-style="italic">terms,</inline> Australia's aid performance in respect of both volume and type of aid ranks us among the world leaders. </para>
      <para>As shown in Statement No. 8, the estimates provide for a total of $220m to be spent on official economic aid to developing countries, including $145m for Papua New Guinea. </para>
      <para>Nearly $14m will also be provided for defence aid to certain developing countries in South-East Asia. In addition, we shall continue to assist in the development of Papua New Guinea's defence force. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL WELFARE</para>
      <para>The Budget provides for significant advances in all areas of social welfare - education, housing, health and pensions. </para>
          <para>Education</para>
        <para>The education of all Australians continues to be a particular concern of the Commonwealth. Direct expenditure by the Commonwealth, including payments to the States for education, is expected to reach $426m - up $72m. </para>
        <para>In addition to general financial assistance, specific payments to the States for education are estimated to reach $250m, compared with $206m last year. </para>
        <para>The largest grants, totalling $138m, are for universities and colleges of advanced education. Provision has been made for the new triennial programmes which commence in January 1973. </para>
        <para>Other payments to the States including capital grants for school construction, secondary school science laboratories and libraries, technical colleges and teachers colleges and per capita grants for independent schools are expected to be SI 12m, an increase of $30m. </para>
        <para>The grants to the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education are $42m. Expenditure on schools and technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is estimated at $49m, compared with $3 9m last year. </para>
        <para>From the beginning of 1973 there will be significant increases in the number of Commonwealth tertiary scholarships available, together with an increase in benefits. The number of Open Entrance University Scholarships will be increased by 1,000 to 9,500, the number of Later Year University Scholarships by 1,000 to 5,000 and the number of Advanced Education Scholarships by 2,000 to 6,000 awards. In addition, there will be increases in the living allowances and a substantial relaxation of the means test applicable to those living allowances. Commonwealth Post-graduate Scholars will receive an increase in their stipends from $2,600 to $2,900 per annum. In all, expenditure on tertiary scholarships this year is estimated at $47m - up $9m. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to change the arrangements for Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships. The new scholarships will be tenable during the last 2 years pf secondary schooling, and will be awarded on the present competitive basis. There will be 25,000 new awards each year, compared with 10,000 under the existing scheme. There will be a change in the benefits. Each award will carry a basic allowance of $150 per annum and a further allowance of up to $250 per annum will be available subject to consideration of family income. Holders of the present Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships who are now in the first year of their awards will receive benefits for their final year in 1973 on the existing basis. During 1972-73 payments are estimated at $8.4rs compared with $6.9m last year. </para>
        <para>During the 1973-75 triennium, grants for research projects recommended by the Australian Research Grants Committee will be $20m, up 48 per cent on the present triennium. This year expenditure is estimated at $6m compared with $4.5m last year. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth wishes to join with the States in a programme to promote the study of Asian languages and cultures in Australian schools. The Commonwealth will contribute $1.5m over a 5 year period. Expenditure this year is estimated at $100,000. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Education and Science will make a detailed statement, and present the reports of the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education for the 1973-75 triennium together with our decision on the recommendations. </para>
          <para>Housing</para>
        <para>We propose changes in the Homes Savings Grant Act to keep it attuned to current conditions. The maximum value of a home which may attract a grant will be increased from $17,500 to $22,500. We will also increase the maximum grant from $500 on savings of $1,500 to $750 on savings of $2,250, with an appropriate increase in the limit on annual qualifying savings. These increases will apply to homes bought or built or whose construction commences, on and after tomorrow. The requirements governing the eligibility of savings in credit unions will be substantially relaxed by requiring only one condition, namely, that not less than 20 per cent of its total annual lending i* in housing loans. The cost of these proposals is estimated at $8. 5m this year and $9.8m in a full year. </para>
        <para>An amount of $70m - up $5m - has been provided for advances under the War Service Homes scheme. </para>
          <para>Health</para>
        <para>The Government has reviewed the arrangements for assisting people requiring nursing home care. We propose to introduce new integrated measures to help not only chronically ill patients in nursing homes, but also to assist aged infirm people who can be looked after in a home environment. </para>
        <para>We shall introduce a nursing home insurance benefit for contributors to hospital insurance organisations. Pensioners who have Pensioner Medical Service entitlement cards will also receive this benefit as additional assistance without having to join a hospital fund. </para>
        <para>When added to the existing Commonwealth benefits of $24.50 a week for ordinary care patients and $45.50 a week for intensive care patients, these new benefits will give nursing home patients greater financial protection against the cost of fees. The amount of the new benefit will vary as between the States. The Minister for Health will give details. </para>
        <para>To reduce the demand for nursing home treatment a new domiciliary care benefit will be payable to a person who, in his own home, accepts responsibility for the provision, on a regular and continuing basis, of professional nursing care and supporting services required by an aged relative. The benefit will be available on the basis of medical need in accordance with requirements determined by the Department of Health and will be paid at the rate of $14 a week. As in the case of nursing home benefits, H will not be subject to a means test. </para>
        <para>The National Health Act will be amended to authorise the introduction of the new nursing home benefits and associated arrangements on 1st January 1972. The domiciliary care benefit will commence from 1st March 1973. </para>
        <para>To encourage the availability of professional nursing care in the home, it is proposed to increase, with effect from 1st September 1972, the existing Commonwealth subsidy to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual Commonwealth payment for each nurse who attracts subsidy will be increased from $3,200 to $4,300. For organisations formed after that date, the subsidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $1,600 to $2,150 a year. As at present, the Commonwealth subsidy to any organisation will not exceed that paid to the organisation by a State. The Minister for Health will be making a general statement. </para>
        <para>To encourage the provision of hostel accommodation for the aged we will, as a special arrangement limited to 3 years, grant organisations that are eligible under the Aged Persons Homes Act special assistance. The Commonwealth will meet the cost of 2 hostel beds for every one unsubsidised bed operated by the organisation or one bed for 2 where the accommodation was previously subsidised on a $ for $ basis. A condition will be that the beds are allocated without donation and in accordance with need. These additional hostel beds will be provided up to a cost not exceeding $7,800 per single unit which is the amount presently allowable for maximum subsidy purposes. In addition, a grant of $250 per unit will be made towards the furnishing of these additional hostel units. </para>
        <para>We will also double the present rate of subsidy to eligible organisations providing personal care services for the aged in hostel accommodation. The new rate will be $10 per week for each occupant aged 80 years or more. </para>
        <para>The cost of these measures in the nursing home, home nursing and aged persons homes areas is estimated at $ 16.9m in 1972-73 and $43.9m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Child Care</para>
        <para>To benefit children from low income and other special need families, the Government proposes to introduce legislation as soon as possible to assist in the establishment and running of child care centres operating on a non-profit basis. It is envisaged that these centres will cater for the children of working parents, giving priority of admission to children in special need, such as those from single parent families, and to the children of sick or incapacitated parents. </para>
        <para>We propose subsidies to enable these centres to offer reduced fees for low income families and others in special need. Unmatched capital grants will be made available direct to approved non-profit organisations for the provision and equipping of such centres and staff subsidies will be provided to encourage the employment of certain appropriately qualified staff. The estimated cost of the scheme this year is $5m. </para>
          <para>Social Services</para>
        <para>I will deal first with the position of the more needy. </para>
        <para>AGE, INVALID, WIDOWS AND SERVICE PENSIONS</para>
      <para>Last April the standard rate of pension was increased by $1.00 a week and the rate for a married pensioner couple by $1.50. When introducing these measures I then said I was anticipating what would normally have been part of our budget measures. </para>
      <para>The Government now proposes that the standard rate of age, invalid and repatriation service pension payable to single people and the pension payable to widows with children be increased to $20.00 a week - that is, by a further $1.75. This brings to $4.50, or 29 per cent, the increase in the standard rate pension since March 1971. </para>
      <para>Widows without children will receive an increase of $1.25 a week to a new maximum weekly rate of $17.25. The combined age, invalid or service pension of a married couple who are both pensioners will be increased by $2.50, raising the maximum weekly payment to them to $34.50. </para>
      <para>The Government has given particular attention to relieving hardship. We will extend eligibility for pension, at the married rate, to the wife of an age, invalid or service pensioner, now not qualified herself foi pension. After taking account of the consequential reduction in the husband's pension in such cases from the standard to the married rate, the present position of such married couples will improve by up to $8.25 a week where the wife is now eligible for wife's allowance and up to $16.25 a week in other cases. </para>
      <para>Further, the supplementary assistance to pensioners paying rent, which is payable subject to a separate means test, will be increased from the present maximum rate of $2 to $4 a week. We propose also to extend eligibility for supplementary assistance to married pensioner couples paying rent. </para>
      <para>The rates of long-term sickness benefit will increase by $1.75 a week for adults and by $1 a week for unmarried minors. The maximum rate of supplementary allowance of $2 a week for long-term sickness beneficiaries will also be increased to $4 a week. </para>
      <para>The increases in the rates of social service pensions and repatriation service pensions and in supplementary assistance and the extensions of eligibility will apply, as appropriate, to rehabilitation, sheltered employment and tuberculosis allowances. </para>
        <para>EASING THE MEANS TEST</para>
      <para class="block">lt has been an important and continuing part of the Government's social welfare policy to relax the means test progressively. As a further step in this policy, and as a prelude to more sweeping proposals to which I shall come in a moment, the Government now proposes immediate large increases in the amount of 'free' means which pensioners may enjoy without reduction in pension. </para>
      <para>Under present pension arrangements, where means-as-assessed exceed $10 a week in the case of a single pensioner and $17 a week for married couples, the means test operates to taper off pension entitlements. </para>
      <para class="block">The Government now proposes to increase the limit of free means from $10 to $20 a week in the case of a single pensioner and from $17 to $34.50 a week in the case of a married pensioner couple - that is, to the same levels as the maximum rates of pension in each case. At the proposed rates of pension, therefore, full pension will be payable until the combined pension and meansasassessed exceed double the pension - that is, $40 a week for the single pensioner and $69 a week  for  a married couple. Eligibility for part-pension will now not cease until meansasassessed reach three times the pension - that is. $60 a week for single persons and $103.50 a week  for  married couples. When we consider that average earnings are now about $98 a week and that pension payments are presently non-taxable, these increased eligibility limits must be considered generous. </para>
      <para>In addition to this substantial easing of the means test generally, we propose 2 other related measures. First, we shall increase from $4 to $6 a week the maximum deduction from income for means test purposes for each child of a pensioner. Secondly, the Government has decided to treat superannuation pensions and annuities more favourably for means test purposes than hitherto. </para>
      <para>At present a superannuation, pension or annuity is treated wholly as income under the means test although such receipts usually comprise substantial elements of capital or savings. We propose that a superannuation pension or annuity which is payable for life be converted into a property equivalent and the latter amount be taken into account in the means test with any other property. Such action would be to the pensioner's advantage in the vast majority of cases. But if. in particular cases, this should not prove to be so, the changed treatment will not be applied. </para>
      <para>Not only will many superannuation pensioners and annuitants receive increases in existing social service pensions, but other superannuitants who are now ineligible for a means-tested pension will also qualify for the first time. Further details will be announced when the legislation is introduced. 1 should make it clear that the eligibility conditions for Commonwealth ancillary benefits, such as membership of the Pensioner Medical Service, which are presently available to more than one million pensioners and their dependants, will not be relaxed as a result of the proposed direct easings of the means test for pension eligibility, including the proposed new treatment of superannuation pensions. Ancillary benefits will be available only to those present and future pensioners who qualify for them under the existing means test for ancillary benefits. The same means test will be used to determine eligibility for ancillary benefits for future pensioners. </para>
      <para>Our social service proposals in total will add $1 45.2m to expenditures in 1972-73 and $ 197.1m in a full year. </para>
        <para>ABOLITION OF THE MEANS TEST</para>
      <para class="block">These are our immediate steps in the field of the means test. </para>
      <para>We have decided to abolish the means test within the next 3 years for age pension eligibility for residentially qualified men and women aged 65 years and over. </para>
      <para>The free of means test pension will be subject to income tax. Following past practice, provision will be made to exempt, or partially relieve from taxation persons in the lower income groups receiving the free of means test pension - up to certain specified limits to be determined. </para>
      <para>We have decided to subject the means test free pension to taxation because of cost and equity considerations. In particular, if everyone in receipt of free of means tes: pensions were to receive them free of tax, those with higher incomes would benefit disproportionately by comparison both with pensioners on lower incomes and people less than 65 not entitled to free of means test pensions. </para>
      <para>The introduction of the proposed free of means test age pensions for persons of 65 or more years will not alter the position of people who are now eligible or may become eligible for pensions on a means tested basis, for example, women aged 60 to 64 years, and widows and invalids who are residentially qualified for pension, and ex-servicemen aged 60 to 64 and exservicewomen aged 55 to 64 who have served in a theatre of war. </para>
      <para>Eligibility for supplementary assistance and for Commonwealth ancillary pensioner benefits, such as membership of the Pensioner Medical Service, will be conditional, as now, on satisfaction of the relevant special means test. </para>
      <para>The Government's commitments to introduce free of means test pensions for people aged 65 or over is an historic decision and represents a major social advance. It is one that has, of course, considerable financial and social implications. Because of this, the Government proposes to appoint a Committee of Enquiry to examine and report on these matters and on how this proposal may be responsibly financed with particular reference to national superannuation. </para>
          <para>Repatriation</para>
        <para>The maximum general rate war pension will be increased by $2.00 to $14.00 a week. </para>
        <para>The special rate pension, or its equivalent, will be increased by $3.50 to $48.00 a week. </para>
        <para>The intermediate rate war pension will be increased by $2.75 to $34.00 a week. </para>
        <para>War widows pensions will be increased by $1.75 to $20.00 a week and the domestic allowance will be increased by 50 cents to $8.50 a week. The allowance payable for each child of a war widow will be increased by 35 cents to $7.35 a week. The pension for a child who has lost both parents will be increased by 70 cents to $14.70 a week. </para>
        <para>Other improvements in repatriation allowances relating to requirements for attendants, to amputees and those who have lost an eye, educational allowances, and student children will be announced by the Minister for Repatriation. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided that it will meet the greater part of the cost of nursing home care for chronically ill war widows, special and intermediate rate war pensioners and First World War nurses on the same basis that I have already mentioned for nursing home patients who are enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service. </para>
        <para>The cost of repatriation benefit proposals is estimated to be $14.8m in 1972-73 and $20m in a full year. </para>
        <para>REVENUE AND THE BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
      <para class="block">The proposals I have just outlined result in expenditure in 1972-73 estimated at $10,078m. </para>
      <para>At existing rates of taxation and charges, receipts in 1972-73 are estimated to total $9,882m. This would imply a deficit of some $196m. In terms of the balance of domestic receipts and expenditures it would mean a domestic surplus of $375m. The actual outcome in 1971-72 was a deficit of $187m and a domestic surplus of $387m. </para>
      <para>I have said that the Government this year attaches high priority to reducing taxation. In framing our proposals we have ensured that the tax measures we wished to bring down could be fitted within an economically sound budget. </para>
      <para>A domestic surplus of $375m would, under current economic circumstances, have an undesirably dampening effect upon the economy. Indeed, I go further. In present economic circumstances what is called for is not a domestic surplus at all but a moderate domestic deficit. The degree of such deficit can only be a matter of broad judgment. What is clear is that our tax proposals are right in line with what is required on economic management grounds. f TAXATION PROPOSALS </para>
      <para>I deal first with some minor increases in taxes, charges and duties. </para>
        <para>LIGHT DUES</para>
      <para class="block">To help meet the rising costs of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase light dues - that is, charges to shipping for the use of these facilities - from 22 cents to 25 cents per net registered ton per quarter from 1st October 1972 to yield $750,000 in 1972-73. </para>
        <para>AIR NAVIGATION CHARGES</para>
      <para class="block">The Government is considering a report on the future basis of charging for airports and airway facilities. In the meantime we have decided to increase air navigation charges by an average of 5 per cent from 1st December 1972 to yield $800,000 in 1972-73. </para>
        <para>LIQUEFIED GAS AND PRODUCTS REFINED FROM OIL SHALE</para>
      <para>At present excise is not levied on liquefied petroleum or other gas used in propelling road vehicles. This constitutes a competitive advantage over motor spirit which could substantially undermine the revenue from excise. While the use of liquefied gas in propelling road vehicles may reduce automotive exhaust pollution, its advantages in this respect are limited in extent and will be diminished as emission control standards are implemented. </para>
      <para>A tax on liquefied gas used in propelling road vehicles will be introdaced at a rate of 3 cents a litre, which is about 20 per cent lower than the excise on motor spirit. Details will be given by the Minister for Customs and Excise. The tax will not be levied on liquefied gas used for purposes other than propelling road vehicles. </para>
      <para>The exemption from excise of products refined from oil shale, introduced many years ago when Australia had no local supplies of crude oil, will be removed. </para>
        <para>A.C.T. STAMP DUTY</para>
      <para class="block">Stamp duties were introduced into the Australian Capital Territory to stop the Terrify being used as a tax haven, and to ensure broad comparability of burdens of taxation in the Territory and the States. </para>
      <para>Last January the States increased their rates of duty on the sale and purchase of marketable securities. The Australian Capital Territory duty on such transactions will be increased to the same level. This means increasing from 20 cents to 30 cents per $100 the duty payable by both buyer and seller in transactions in marketable securities through brokers, and the same proportionate increase in the rate of duty payable to buyers in transactions not through brokers. The increased charges will take effect from 1st November 1972. The yield will be $200,000 in 1972-73. </para>
      <para>I now come to our tax concessions. Sales Tax </para>
      <para>The Government has decided to exempt works of art from sates tax regardless of origin or of nationality of the artist. The cost to revenue is expected to be $480,000 in 1972-73 and $600,000 in a full year. </para>
      <para>We did consider whether some part of our major taxation reductions should be in the sales tax field. Such a course has been urged from some quarters as a means of bringing down prices and assisting to arrest inflation. But calculations show that a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent in the rate of sales tax on all goods in the 15 per cent and 27* per cent rate classes would cost over $90m in a full year but would directly reduce the consumer price index by a once only 0.2 per cent even if the cut were passed on in full to the final consumer. </para>
      <para>Our conclusion is that we should, with 2 exceptions, concentrate reductions in the field of personal income tax. First, the 2 exceptions. </para>
      <para class="block">Estate Duty lt is clear that estate duty is now falling too heavily on modest estates. Except for a change which was made in 1970 in respect of primary producers, the exemption limits have remained unchanged since 1963. With rising money values, an increasing number of quite modest estates are becoming dutiable. On other, but still not large estates, heavy amounts of duty are being levied. </para>
      <para>The general statutory exemptions are presently $20,000 where the estate passes wholly to close relatives and $10,000 where it passes wholly to others. For primary producer estates the limits are higher, at $24,000 and $12,000, respectively. </para>
      <para>It is proposed to double all statutory exemptions. Approximately one-half of all estates which would be dutiable under present law will be totally exempted from duty by these proposals. </para>
      <para>The shading-in provisions will have the effect of reducing duty payable on estates with a value up to 5 times the exemption limit- Only 5 per cent of estates which would be dutiable under present law will not experience some reduction in duty. </para>
      <para>The cost to revenue of this proposal, which will apply to the estates of persons whose deaths occur after today, is $3m in 1972-73 and $19m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Gift Duty</para>
        <para>It is also proposed to increase the exemption level for gift duty. At present where the total value of all gifts made by the same donor within the period of 18 months before and 18 months after the time of making the gift does not exceed $4,000, no duty is payable. It is proposed to increase the exemption to $10,000 where a gift is made after today. The cost to revenue is expected to be $400,000 in 1972-73 and $750,000 in a full year. </para>
        <para class="block">Personal Income Taxation SELF EDUCATION </para>
        <para>I mention first a relatively small fiscal matter, but one which we regard as of high importance to personal incentive and careerbuilding. We propose to allow a deduction for income tax purposes of up to $400 for expenditure by a taxpayer on his own education where the expenditure is related to his income-producing activities but is not allowable under the existing law. Details will be given when the legislation is introduced. </para>
        <para>The cost to revenue is estimated to be $200,000 in 1972-73 and $4. 5m in a full year. </para>
        <para>THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX BURDEN</para>
      <para class="block">The Government views with concern the considerable increase in the relative burden of personal income taxation in recent years and the effects which that is having upon our economy and, indeed, our society. In particular, the single income family, the typical suburban family man, is being hit hard. </para>
      <para>We strongly believe that personal income taxation is now too high and that, without action to cut it, the situation will become progressively worse with the passage of time. The interaction of money incomes rising with inflation and the progressive rate scale is imposing heavy and increasing burdens. This year provides an opportunity to reduce these burdens. Accordingly, we have decided to concentrate our tax concessions in the area of personal income tax. Our reasons are: - </para>
      <para>First, the personal income tax burden is becoming more and more severe. The tax bite is being determined, not in accordance with deliberate aims of policy, but by the impact of inflation on a scale basically designed for another level of incomes altogether. </para>
      <para>Secondly, the family man in particular, with all of his other commitments, is finding income taxation looming ever-larger as a problem, and is coming to question the fairness of the burden he bears. </para>
      <para>Thirdly, rising taxation is affecting incentives and encouraging tax avoidance. </para>
      <para>Fourthly, rising taxation adds to pressure for excessive increases in money wages and salaries. We believe our measures will provide grounds for moderation. </para>
      <para>Fifthly, a reduction in personal income tax will put more money directly into the hands of consumers. Their take-home pay and their capacity to spend will be enhanced. There will be a real lift to community and business psychology. That is just what is needed at this time. </para>
        <para>MINIMUM TAXABLE INCOME</para>
      <para class="block">We propose to raise the minimum taxable income for individuals from $417 to $1,041 per annum. The proposal will exempt from tax liability altogether about 600,000 taxpayers - among them part-time employees, including married women and students working in vacations. Although persons earning more than $20 in any week may be subjected to PAYE deductions, any PAYE deductions will be refunded if their annual taxable income is below the new minimum of $1,041. The cost to revenue is $14m in 1972-73 and $18m in a full year. </para>
        <para>DEPENDANTS' ALLOWANCES</para>
      <para class="block">The second proposal is very much the product of what I have said earlier about the especially heavy burdens on the family man. We propose to increase all dependants' allowances by $52. This increase in dependants' allowances will cost $3 8m in 1972-73 and $63m in a full year. </para>
        <para>THE INCOME TAX RATE SCALE</para>
      <para class="block">Last and most importantly, we propose to reduce the rates of personal income tax payable by an average of 10 per cent. In April we reduced personal income tax by 21 per cent; the reduction I now propose is on top of that. </para>
      <para>A flat rate cut based on removing the present 21 per cent levy and the granting of a 71 per cent rebate across the board was a possible course. However, we have decided to take what we regard as the more equitable course of re-structuring the tax scale so as to ensure diminishing percentage reductions as incomes rise. Taxable incomes below about $5,500 per annum - that is, the great bulk of taxpayers - will be subject to reductions in taxation larger than 10 per cent; taxable incomes above $5,500 to lower reductions. For example, persons with a taxable income of $2,000 per annum will receive a 14.2 per cent reduction in taxation; at $4,000 the reduction will be 12.4 per cent; at $6,000, 9.4 per cent; at $10,000, 8.0 per cent; and at $40,000, the new maximum marginal tax rate point, the reduction is down to 6.5 per cent. </para>
      <para>Let me give one example to show what our income tax proposals taken as a whole will mean to the taxpayers. A family man with a wife and 2 children to support who is earning $98.00 a week - roughly the current level of average weekly earnings - at present would pay annual income tax equivalent to $16 a week if he has no other concessional deductions. Under our proposals this will be cut by $2.75 a week or 17 per cent. If he has other concessional deductions, his present tax bill will be cut by a larger percentage than that. </para>
      <para>The cost to revenue of re-structuring the income tax scale as proposed is estimated at $380m in 1972-73 and $480m in a full year. </para>
      <para>Our income tax proposals will be reflected in revised PAYE schedules that will be applied to wages and salaries paid from 1st September 1972. </para>
      <para>In total, the income tax proposals I have outlined will cost $432m in 1972-73 and $565m in a full year. In conjunction with the sales tax, estate duty and gift duty concessions and the minor increases in certain taxes and charges already mentioned, the net cost of all our measures in the revenue field is put at $434m in 1972-73 and $583m in a full year. </para>
        <para>THE OVERALL DEFICIT</para>
      <para class="block">On the basis of these figures and of the expenditure estimates mentioned earlier, we are therefore budgeting for an overall deficit of $630m. </para>
      <para>I said earlier that, in terms of an overall outcome which would be consistent with criteria of sound economic management and a responsible fiscal approach, we should be aiming at not more than a moderate deficit in terms of our domestic receipts and outlays. The estimated domestic deficit is $60ra. That seems to us appropriate in current economic circumstances. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>In this budget we have provided for record increases in social welfare benefits; we have made a long-awaited move in the field of estate duty; and we have slashed personal income taxation. So far as its direct impact on the individual is concerned, I repeat, what the Budget means is - taxes down, pensions up, and particular help to the family man. </para>
      <para>Overall, the Budget will be stimulatory. Our economy, over the years, has demonstrated a capacity for robust growth. The Budget will give the economy the real and psychological boost which is what it now needs to resume a strong growth path. </para>
      <para>Of course, any budget can only be framed on the basis of the Government's best judgment at the time. What the future holds can always be only dimly seen. We shall review economic trends as the year goes on to ensure that the economy moves properly towards its sustainable growth path. </para>
      <para>The Government can lay the groundwork for a year of good growth and prosperity. But we shall have to continue to counter the forces adding to inflationary pressures. The Budget is designed to create demand conditions which can be matched by output. It will not bring about a resurgence of demand inflation in the year ahead. But the battle against inflation stemming from cost pressures will have to continue unabated. The emphasis we have laid upon increasing take-home pay through our tax cuts should assist in that battle by providing grounds for more moderation on the wage-push front, and we hope that will be forthcoming. </para>
      <para>I think it right to inject this cautionary note. But tonight I shall not dwell upon it further. </para>
      <para>This Budget serves the nation's larger purposes. There are, of course, challenges ahead as well as rewards. This is always so. But anyone who looks around this country - especially if he recalls it 20 years ago - will see why we have cause to read the future with confidence. </para>

          <para>The Economic Context</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Budget for  1972-73  has been framed in the context of an economy already picking up from the moderate rate of growth experienced in  1971-72.  Features of the economy presently include an easy labour market and an over-rapid, though moderating, rate of increase in costs and prices. Economic growth is expected to quicken considerably in  1972-73. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">1971-72</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimates of the main components of gross national product and gross national expenditure in  1971-72  are given in detail in the document 'National Income and Expenditure  1971- 72'  presented with the Budget Papers. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In terms of constant prices, the main changes in  1971-72  from  1970-71  shown by the estimates are: -  o  an increase of  3.1  per cent in gross national product, comprising increases of  2.8  per cent in gross non-farm product and  6.1  per cent in gross farm product;  o  an increase of  1 . 1  per cent in gross national expenditure, comprising increases of  3.2  per cent in personal consumption expenditure,  4.6  per cent in gross private fixed investment in housing and  3.2  per cent in public authority expenditures on goods and services, partially offset by a decline of  5.8  per cent in gross private fixed investment other than in housing and a reversal of some  $520  million in the movement in stocks; o strong growth of  9.2  per cent in exports of goods and services and a fall of  2.1  per  cent in imports of goods and services. (In current price terms, there was an excess of exports of goods and services over imports of  $472  million, compared with an excess of imports over exports of  $44  million in  1970-71.) </para>
        <para>Also in  1971-72:-  e there were continued high rates of increase in money wages and in prices, although some moderation, more particularly in prices, became evident in the second half of the year;  o  the labour market eased throughout the year, but the bulk of the rise in the seasonally- adjusted unemployment rate from  1.3  per cent of the estimated work force at June  1971  to  1 .9  per cent at June  1972  occurred in the eight months to February  1972;  o the money supply grew rapidly, at a rate of  10.5  per cent, reflecting the large balance of payments surplus and the easier stance of monetary policy for most of the year. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">1972- 73</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the time the budget was formulated, a recovery in economic growth in  1972-73  would have been expected, but to a lesser extent than the productive potential of the economy would accommodate. With a view to reinforcing the rate of this recovery, the budget provides for increases in expenditures, particularly for social welfare and for allocations to the States, arid for substantial taxation concessions aimed at providing a stimulus to private demand, particularly consumer spending. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Demand generally should therefore grow considerably more strongly in  1972-73  than in  1971-72.  The growth of consumer spending, which has shown some signs of improvement in recent months, is expected- under the influence of policy measures adopted in the budget and earlier - to accelerate. Private fixed investment in dwellings should continue to grow strongly, and the downturn in non-dwelling investment which occurred in  1971-72  is expected to be reversed during the course of  1972-73.  The dis-investment in stocks evident last year is also expected to be reversed this year. Public sector demand, both Commonwealth and State, should continue to run high. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1972-73 gross national product at constant prices seems likely, on present indications and unforeseen major new developments apart, to increase by about 5 per cent. This estimate should be reflected in increases of the order of 2 per cent in employment and 3 per cent in productivity- though the latter figure, in particular, is subject to a broad margin of uncertainty. These estimates relate to year on year comparisons - that is, 1 972-73 on 1 97 1 -72. <inline font-style="italic">During</inline> 1972-73, however, growth in employment, productivity and gross national product at constant prices is expected to be greater than suggested by the foregoing figures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking the year as a whole, some moderation in wage rates and in prices from the rapid increases experienced in 1971-72 might be hoped for. Nevertheless, with wage rates currently still rising strongly, a relatively large increase of 9 per cent in average weekly earnings has been assumed for the purpose of estimating pay-as-you-earn tax collections. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Budget Estimates in National Accounts Terms</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates in national accounts terms are set out in detail in Statement No. 2 where the economic implications of the Budget are also discussed. Further information on the national accounts estimates of Commonwealth budget receipts and outlays, together with information on the transactions of Commonwealth authorities operating outside the budget, is contained in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin which accompanies the budget documents. The following table summarises the main budget aggregates in national accounts form. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="079131197208151_52_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">Notable aspects are: - o An estimated increase of 12.5 percent in budget domestic outlays in 1972 73 compared with ah actual increase of 11 .5 per cent in 1971-72. These figures have been affected by the transfer of pay-roll tax revenues to the States and the associated adjustment of financial assistance grants payable. Approximately adjusted to remove the effects of that transfer, the estimated increases in domestic outlays in 1972-73 and 1971-72 would be 13.5 per cent and 14.8 per cent, respectively. The decline in the rate of increase in domestic outlays between the two years reflects, among other things, the effects of additional public service and pension pay-days in 1971-72 which inflated expenditure in that year. e The Commonwealth's domestic expenditures on goods and services are estimated to increase by 9.4 per cent following an increase of 1 1 .7 per cent last year. This slowing in the rate of increase mainly reflects the occurrence of an additional public service pay-day in 1971-72 and wage and cost increases which occurred in that year. o A small decrease of 0 . 7 per cent in total budget outlays overseas following an increase of 5.6 per cent in 1971-72. Direct expenditures on goods and services overseas are estimated to increase rapidly, largely because of an expected build-up in payments for defence equipment purchased overseas. There is, however, an offsetting reduction in advances to Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission to finance the purchase of aircraft and equipment overseas. o Overall, total outlays are estimated to increase by 1 1 .7 per cent in the current financial year compared with an increase of 1 1 . 1 per cent last year. Adjusted to remove the effects of factors distorting year-to-year comparisons of the figures, the estimated percentage increase in outlays in 1972-73 - 13.5 per cent - is similar to that which occurred last year, that is, 13.1 per cent. o Before taking account of the proposed revenue measures the increase in total receipts in 1972-73 is estimated at 1 1 . 8 per cent. After allowance for the effects of the revenue proposals, which are estimated to reduce taxation collections in 1 972-73 by $436 million, the estimated increase is 6.9 per cent. These figures are affected by the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States from September 1971. Adjusted to remove the effects of this transfer, total receipts are estimated to increase by 8. 1 per cent in 1972-73 compared with an adjusted increase of 1 3 . 0 per cent in the previous year. The substantial reduction in personal tax rates in 1972-73, following as it does a decrease in the rate of levy on personal income tax late in 1971-72, will add substantially to disposable incomes in Australia and should provide a significant stimulus to demand. o Significant increases in social service and other benefits announced in the Budget Speech, taken together with the large taxation concessions announced in the budget, are estimated to result in an excess of outlays in Australia over revenue collected in Australia. The budget domestic deficit for 1972-73 is estimated at $60 million. This compares with a domestic surplus of about $387 million in 1971-72. Thus, in contrast to last year, it is expected that budget domestic outlays and receipts this year will add moderately to liquidity, rather than subtract from it. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Budget Estimates in 'Conventional' Terms</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following table summarises the estimates for 1972-73 and actual expenditures and receipts for 1971-72 in so-called 'conventional' terms. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main elements in the estimated change in expenditures in 1972-73 and the actual change in expenditures in 1971-72 are indicated in the following table: - </para>
        <para class="block">Features of the estimates are: - o The large prospective increase of $395 million in payments to or for the States and works and housing programmes. Of this increase a total of $218 million relates to additional financial assistance grants and increased works and housing programmes agreed at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meetings in June 1972. At these meetings it was also announced that the monthly rate of grants for non metropolitan unemployment relief would be increased. The provision included in the budget for these grants is $45 million greater than expenditure for these purposes in 1971-72. Comparisons with the increase in payments to or for the States in the previous year are affected by the arrangements under which pay-roll tax was transferred to the States. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> The proposed increases of $326 million in expenditure from the National Welfare Fund and $36 million in expenditure on repatriation services. Measures announced in the Budget Speech account for $183 million of these increases, while the full-year effects of increases in benefit rates and other measures announced in the 1971-72 budget and subsequently during that year are estimated to add a further $1 1 1 million to expenditures in 1972-73. The increase in expenditures under these headings would have been larger but for variations in the number of pension and child endowment pay-days between the two years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> An estimated increase of $106 million in expenditures on defence services. The size of the increase is diminished by the occurrence of one less pay-day in 1972-73 than in 1971-72. A large part of the estimated increase relates to purchases of defence equipment and stores. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> The proposed increase of $62 million in departmental running expenses. This compares with an increase of S97 million in 1971-72, about $17 million of which resulted from the occurrence of an additional pay-day in that year. o The estimated decrease of $35 million in Commonwealth payments to industry. Wool deficiency payments are estimated to be $52 million less than in 1971-72, reflecting the improvement in the market for wool. In addition, wheat stabilisation payments will be made in respect of only one year's wheat pool in 1972-73; in 1971-72 payments were made in respect of both the 1969-70 and 1970-71 pools. <inline font-style="italic">o</inline> An estimated increase of $74 million in 'other expenditures', which incorporates a number of the new policy measures and increased provisions announced in the Budget Speech. Examples include increased numbers of Commonwealth scholarships, assistance for child care centres, new and expanded employment training schemes and an increased provision for Aboriginal advancement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Further details of the estimates of expenditure for 1972-73 are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Before taking account of the revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech, and on the basis of an ongoing levy of 2£ per cent on personal income taxation, it is estimated that total Commonwealth receipts would have increased by $1,036 million or 11 .7 per cent in 1972-73. This includes an estimated increase of $992 million or 12.7 per cent in taxation revenues. Comparisons with increases in previous years are affected by the transfer of the pay-roll tax to the States. After taking account of this factor, the increase in total receipts on the basis outlined above would be slightly less than that which occurred in 1971-72. This arises in part from the fact that rates of taxation were increased in the 1971-72 budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The assumed increases in average earnings and employment would be expected to produce  a  substantial increase in pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions under the existing taxation provisions, including the personal income tax levy of 2£ per cent. In addition, pay-as-you-earn refunds are estimated to decrease in 1972-73, one factor being the effect of the variations made to tax instalment schedules in 1970-71 and 1971-72. Net pay-as-you-earn income tax collections are estimated, on this basis, to increase by $751 million or 26 per cent. The recovery in primary producers' incomes in 1971-72, together with increases in other business incomes subject to tax in 1972-73, would also result in a substantial increase in income tax collections from individuals subject to provisional tax. However, company income subject to tax is estimated to have increased only modestly in 1971-72, with the result that collections of income tax from companies in 1972-73 are expected to show only a modest increase over  1971-72  collections. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Continued growth in private sector expenditures, including a higher rate of importing, is .expected to produce increased revenue from indirect taxes. However, the rate of growth in excise duty revenues, in particular, is affected by duty rate increases which were announced last year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proposed revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce receipts by a net $434 million in 1972-73 and $583 million in a full year. These measures and their estimated revenue effects are shown in the following table: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After taking account of the effects of these proposed changes, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to amount to $9,447 million, which is $602 million or 6.8 per cent greater than in 1971-72. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Further details of the estimates of receipts are given in Statement No. 5. <inline font-style="italic">Summing Up</inline></para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The budget is aimed at providing a stimulus sufficient to result in the present slack in the use of labour and other resources being taken up during the course of the year, but not so much as to bring about a re-emergence of excess demand pressures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the budget provides for large increases in outlays on social welfare and in payments to or for the States, overall outlays have been held to much the same rate of increase as last year. The budget is designed, rather, so that the major stimulus to the economy will be imparted through the very substantial reductions in personal income taxation rates. As well as relieving the tax burden, the aim is to stimulate private sector activity without at the same time adding unduly to the rate of growth in public sector expenditure </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overall, the growth in outlays and the taxation concessions announced in the Budget Speech will result in a substantial increase in the budget deficit to about $630 million. Outlays <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> Australia are estimated to exceed receipts <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> Australia by approximately $60 million, thus resulting in a budget <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> deficit for the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated domestic deficit will, in itself, add to private sector liquidity for the year as a whole. The net effects on liquidity of the Commonwealth's transactions will, however, also depend on the Commonwealth's financing transactions during the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The effect on liquidity of the domestic deficit will not be uniform throughout the year, largely because of the seasonality in tax collections. Thus, in the first half of the financial year there will be a large temporary budget deficit which will add substantially to private sector liquidity during that period. During the second half of the year the budget will move into surplus as tax payments are made and this will withdraw liquidity from the economy. It is to be noted, of course, that the liquidity situation will.be affected by factors other than the Commonwealth's transactions, notably by developments in the external sector. The monetary and financial aspects of the budget are more fully discussed in Statement No. 3. </para>

        <para>The Budget Estimates in National Accounts Form </para>
        <para>General</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The influence of the Commonwealth budget upon trends in the economy may usefully be considered as operating through the effects on incomes and expenditures transmitted by changes in particular types of budget outlays and receipts and through the effects of the budget and its financing upon liquidity in the economy. Moreover, the budget may affect private sector expectations about economic prospects. This statement is devoted primarily to an examination of the first of these transmission mechanisms, although some reference is made to the possible effects of the budget upon private sector expectations. Statement No. 3 presents an examination of the implications of domestic budget transactions for Australian monetary conditions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The economic effects of particular classes of outlays and receipts differ significantly from one another. On the outlay side, it is particularly important to distinguish between domestic and overseas outlays. This distinction must be made because the immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments, f1) while domestic outlays have their substantial effects upon domestic economic activity. There is also an important distinction to be made within domestic outlays between expenditures on goods and services, on the one hand, and transfers and advances from the budget, on the other. This further distinction is important because government expenditures on goods and services add directly to demand within the economy, while the impact on demand of transfers and advances depends upon their effects on the spending of the recipients. (2) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As with outlays, differences exist between the various taxes and charges in terms of their economic effects. These differences pertain both to the magnitude of their effects upon real expenditures and prices and to the time lags between implementation and effect. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is a further and fundamental distinction, which is of particular significance on the revenue side, to be made when assessing the effects of budgetary measures. This is the distinction between the revenues which would have been collected with unchanged tax rates and charges, and the estimated collections allowing for any changes in rates and charges contained in the budget. Changes in revenues in the former class result from changes in the economy which affect the bases on which taxes are levied. (3) The latter class, however, also includes the effects on revenues of any changes in rates and charges. Changes in revenue of the first kind, of course, exert an influence upon economic activity. However, only changes in revenue arising from changes in rates and charges can be considered as stemming from the independent influence of policy measures upon the economy and as capable of influencing trends in the economy which would otherwise be expected to emerge. In contrast, the existing tax structure is part of the complex of factors producing presently forseen trends and therefore cannot be seen as capable of offsetting them. By convention then, only changes in revenue of the discretionary type are considered as part of the impact of the budget. (') Such payments do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Payments within Australia may add indirectly to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content. Although il is not possible to make reliable estimates of the import content of Commonwealth expenditure within Australia the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and the next. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth may fluctuate widely between one year and another. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main overseas components are shown separately in Table <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> on page 9 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, entitled 'National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure', being published concurrently with the Budget. (*) It is also important to distinguish, in practice, between different types of transfers and advances, because of the differences which may exist between the ways in which the amounts are spent by the various recipients of these budget outlays. (*) For the most pan, movements which would be expected in gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, fall within this class. Collections of income tax from individuals subject to provisional tax and from companies are also of this type although in these cases past movements are also involved </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The distinction made above is blurred somewhat due to changes in " effective " rates of tax which are themselves the product of changing economic trends. In particular, due to the progressive nature of the income tax scale, as income rises the average, or effective, rate of tax will increase. Similarly, since different classes of goods are subject to different rates of sales and excise taxes, changes in the composition of sales will yield changes in the overall effective rates of sales and excise taxes. While changes of this sort therefore involve changes in effective rates of tax they are, again by convention, classified as arising from economic trends rather than policy measures^1) in order fully to evaluate the influence of budget outlays and receipts upon economic conditions, consideration must be given not only to the <inline font-style="italic">impact</inline> effects of these measures but also to the <inline font-style="italic">subsequent</inline> economic effects which arise because of the complex interrelationships between different sectors of the economy. The latter effects inevitably require some time to develop , to assess them fully requires consideration of the timing of budget transactions and the time lags associated with the subsequent effects which flow from them. The significantly different impact effects of various categories of outlays and receipts have been referred to above, lt is important to point out that the time required for these subsequent changes to have effect also varies between different categories. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Finally, it might be reiterated that the influence of a particular budget upon the economy and the appropriateness of that influence, can only be evaluated by relating the budget in question to the particular economic context to which it applies. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The presentation of budget outlays and receipts in national accounts form facilitates the analysis of the relationship between the budget and the economy as a whole. The following analysis accordingly utilises budget figures expressed in national accounts form. </para>

      <para class="italic">
        <inline font-style="italic">The Effects of Changes in Budget Outlays and Receipts</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The 1972-73 Budget has been formulated in the context of an assessment of economic prospects throughout the following twelve months. The budget, however, is only one of many major influences upon economic developments, and any assessment at this point of economic prospects in 1972-73 must be subject to a degree of uncertainty. Unforeseen developments arising either from domestic or overseas influences may result in the need for corrective policy action at some future date. Flexibility in economic policy is, for these reasons, of obvious importance. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the economic effects in 1972-73 of the expansionary policy measures announced during the course of 1971-72 will be significant, the latest assessment of economic prospects for this financial year suggests that further stimulus to the economy is warranted - particularly in relation to consumption demand. The magnitude of the desirable stimulus - either through increased outlays or in terms of revenue forgone - depends, of course, upon the expected trends in the economy, relative to the likely availability of resources, in the absence of new policy measures. The total cost to the budget of the policy measures required to produce that stimulus will in turn depend upon the particular measures adopted, because, as already discussed, different outlays and receipts have different economic effects. Accordingly, the cost to the budget of imparting a given stimulus to the economy would be somewhat higher if that stimulus were to be produced through increases in transfers and advances or reductions in taxation than if it were sought through increased expenditure on goods and services. (') It might be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective trends in some particular areas of activity which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in practice, bc corrected fully or quickly by fiscal or monetary means. Should average earnings rise by less than assumed in compiling budget estimates, taxation revenue would for that reason tend to be less than estimated and a larger budget deficit would tend to emerge (although the extent of the increase in the budget deficit would not reflect the full extent of the shortfall in receipts, because some components of expenditure - for example, financial assistance grants to the States - could also be lower than estimated if average earnings rose more slowly than assumed). It would not follow, however, that the budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be affected adversely by such a development </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The magnitude of the direct effects of increases in budget domestic outlays or receipts is, of course, only one of a number of factors which must be considered. For example, a stimulus affecting a particular sector rather than a general impetus to aggregate demand, may be required. As noted above, one area which - on present indications - requires stimulus in 1972-73 is consumption demand. Accordingly, increases in transfer payments - particularly increased pensions - and reduced personal income taxation rates, which may be expected to exert much of their economic impact through increased consumption demand, are features of the 1972-73 Budget. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the 1972-73 Budget measures relating to National Welfare Fund and repatriation benefits alone are estimated to add over $183 million to domestic outlays while it is estimated that a net $436 million of revenue will be forgone as a result of the taxation measures announced in the Budget Speech. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The taxation measures proposed in the 1972-73 Budget have been formulated, for the most part, to stimulate private sector spending. This applies particularly to the decisions to increase the minimum taxable income for individuals from $417 to $1,041 per annum, the increase of $52 per annum in the dependants' allowances, and the decision to reduce rates of personal income tax payable by an average of 10 per cent. These and other measures are also intended to benefit the family man and lower and medium income groups. </para>
      <para>Review</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget is the main vehicle for fiscal policies aimed at demand management and is particularly important, therefore, in relation to short run economic objectives. Budgets, of course, have other and wider objectives and, moreover, even in relation to short run economic objectives, cannot be framed in terms of achieving precise targets. The nature of economic phenomena precludes this. None the less, in the present economic context, in which a degree of tinder-utilisation of resources exists, the objective of stimulating demand assumes relatively greater importance than may be the case at other times. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The new measures announced in the Budget Speech will add significantly to the growth of gross national product in 1972-73. Overall, before adjustment for special factors, domestic outlays are estimated to increase by $1,065 million. This increase arises from a variety of sources, including the rising cost of existing programmes. A significant factor contributing to the increase is the cost of measures adopted during 1971-72, including those decisions announced at the Premiers' Conference and Australian Loan Council Meetings in June. The most important source, however, of increased outlays is the new measures announced in the Budget Speech. The new taxation measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce revenue by $436 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The effects of these measures on spending cannot be precisely quantified, not least because the effect they have on expectations and business and community psychology makes mechanical calculation vulnerable to error. However, it is clear that the 1972-73 Budget will both add directly and substantially to spending in the economy, and particularly to consumer spending and will also encourage private sector expectations of an increased rate of growth and employment during 1972-73. In this way, the 1972-73 Budget should contribute to an improvement in private sector confidence. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To summarise: the Budget is quite strongly stimulatory. Although the full effects will not be felt immediately, there will be a significant impetus given to spending, particularly to consumer spending, and the economy should resume a strong growth path during 1972-73. </para>

        <para>General</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The economic impact of the budget is not restricted to the direct influence on expenditure and income discussed in Statement No. 2. The budget can also have significant effects on economic activity through its influence on monetary conditions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The monetary effects of the budget can usefully be divided into two broad components. First, there is the direct impact of budget receipts and outlays on liquidity and the money supply. This can be measured by the budget domestic surplus or deficit - that is, the excess or shortfall of receipts in Australia over outlays in Australia. A domestic surplus, other things being equal, involves a withdrawal from the volume of money of an equivalent amount ; a domestic deficit adds an equivalent amount to the volume of money. The budget's monetary impact, however, is not determined only by the size of the domestic surplus or deficit but also depends importantly on the monetary effects deriving from the Commonwealth's domestic financing transactions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth's financing transactions - together with Reserve Bank open market operations- have a major impact on the volume and composition of financial assets in the economy and may have a significant influence on the cost and availability of funds through direct and indirect effects on interest rates and the value of financial assets. Measurement of the monetary effects of financing transactions must take into account not only the movements in total holdings of Commonwealth securities which may occur over a period but also the types and maturities of those securities and the classes of institutions or persons holding them. In particular, it is important to distinguish between changes in holdings of government securities by the banking system and by the non-bank private sector. An increase in the holdings of Commonwealth securities by the latter group operates to reduce the volume of money while a reduction in these holdings has the opposite effect. An increase in the holdings of the banking system does not in the same way directly affect the volume of money or the total - as distinct from the components - of the L.G.S. assets which constitute the general banking system's liquidity base. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in holdings of government securities by particular groups are not, of course, solely the result of the budget. These changes may be affected by the market operations in government securities of the Reserve Bank and by all of the other factors affecting monetary and liquidity conditions generally. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The stance of monetary policy, especially in regard to official interest rates and controls on the banking system, will have a particularly important influence on monetary and financial conditions. Other important factors influencing such conditions include the private sector's international trading and borrowing; Reserve Bank transactions with the private sector such as Rural Credits Department advances; and the activities of financial intermediaries, particularly the lending activities of the general banking system. All these various influences are significantly inter-related and the effects of the Commonwealth's transactions on monetary conditions cannot be considered in isolation^1) (') A detailed analysis or the monetary effects of the budget is contained in the 'Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin "National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure" August 1967*. </para>
        <para>THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1971-72</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The analysis of the influence of the Commonwealth's budgetary transactions and other factors on monetary conditions can most conveniently be framed in terms of a money formation table'. The following table provides such an analysis for each half of 1971-72 and for the two preceding years. </para>

      </list>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth budget domestic surplus withdrew about $387 million from private sector primary liquidity and the volume of money over the 1971-72 financial year. This was very much less than the $630 million estimated at the time of the budget and was the smallest domestic surplus since 1968-69. The reduction in the size of the domestic surplus from that originally provided for reflected in large part the effects of the various budgetary measures taken during the year which, apart from their direct influence on expenditure and income, also had significant liquidity-increasing effects. These effects were consistent with and reinforced the easier stance adopted for monetary policy during the year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The easier stance of monetary policy was reflected, inter alia, in the significant reductions which occurred during the year in yields on Commonwealth securities. These yield reductions notwithstanding, however, there was a substantial increase of $713 million in the holdings of Commonwealth securities by the non-bank private sector. The strength of this increase appears to have been due in significant part to the generally easy monetary conditions which prevailed for most of the year and which emanated largely from the strong growth in the surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions, as reflected in Reserve Bank holdings of gold and foreign exchange. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The strong growth in overseas reserves, related to both a high rate of private capital inflow and a substantially reduced current account deficit in the balance of payments, was the major factor contributing to the very strong increase of about $1,410 million in private sector primary liquidity during 1971-72. This, together with the reduced Commonwealth budget domestic surplus and the various other factors affecting monetary aggregates resulted in an increase in the volume of money of 10.5 per cent in the year. As shown below this was a substantially larger increase than has been experienced in recent years. </para>

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">While the foregoing summarises the full-year monetary effects of the Commonwealth's budgetary and financing transactions, the seasonality in such transactions means that these effects can vary markedly during the year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">During the first half of 1971-72 Commonwealth budgetary transactions resulted in a domestic deficit of about $1 ,270 million and added substantially to private sector liquidity. At the same time, private capital inflow into Australia, which had run at high levels in the final quarters of 1970-71, continued at a high rate. The strong growth in liquidity reflected itself, in part, in the fast growing money supply but in part, also, in a strong demand for government securities by the non-bank private sector. Overall, financial conditions eased significantly. These easier financial conditions were also facilitated by the easier stance of monetary policy. In October 1971 the banks were informed that there would be no objection to some increase in their level of lending and this was followed in December by a large release from Statutory Reserve Deposits and the removal of all official restraints on bank lending. Yields on government securities had also fallen significantly by the end of December. During the six months to December 1971 the volume of money increased by 7.7 per cent compared with 5.8 per cent in the six months to December 1970. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the second half of 1971-72 the Commonwealth's budgetary transactions resulted in a domestic surplus of about $1,660 million. The effects of this large surplus on liquidity conditions were, however, very substantially offset by a continued high level of private capital inflow and a marked strengthening in the current account of the balance of payments. In addition, further monetary policy action was taken in February. Yields on government securities were again lowered with the objective of ensuring that financial conditions were not a restraining factor on the economy during the period of normal seasonal contraction in liquidity. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the event, the contraction in liquidity towards the end of the year did not cause difficulties in financial markets and 1971-72 closed with the private sector in a relatively liquid situation and with financial intermediaries in a position to significantly expand their lending. During the six months to June 1972 the volume of money increased by 2.6 per cent compared with 1 .0 per cent in the six months to June 1971. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Details of changes in holdings of Commonwealth debt in each hall of 1971-72 and in the two preceding years are shown in the following table. </para>

        <para>PROSPECTS FOR 1972-73</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">There are, as usual, many uncertainties in the way of predicting the course of monetary conditions over the year ahead. This, however, applies particularly in the current situation of international monetary uncertainty. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The budget for 1972-73 as a whole is estimated to produce a domestic deficit of the order of $60 million. This is in contrast to the domestic surpluses of recent budgets and other things being equal, this should facilitate further strong growth in private sector liquidity and the volume of money. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As suggested above, monetary conditions in 1972-73 will also depend importantly on the outcome in respect of private sector international trading and financing and in part on the demand for government securities. An important influence on this latter factor, as well as on other factors influencing monetary conditions, will be the stance adopted for monetary policy during the year. </para>

However, repayments of previous loans raised to finance advances to Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission are estimated at $38 million, $13 million more than new drawings expected in 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A net reduction in Commonwealth indebtedness overseas is expected in 1972-73. A borrowing of 10,000 million yen (approximately $28 million) for general purposes was made in Japan in July 1972, but no other overseas borrowings for general purposes are at present in prospect. Redemptions of maturing loans in London and New York and other commitments on overseas loans are estimated to amount to $84 million in 1972-73. On this basis, the amount to be financed in Australia would be greater than the estimated deficit of $630 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The value of securities due to mature in Australia during 1972-73 held in non-official hands at 30 June 1972 is estimated at $507 million (including Special Bonds $71 million), compared with $722 million (including Special Bonds $53 million) of securities maturing in 1971-72 which were in non-official hands at 30 June 1971. Net loan proceeds and the net change in the Treasury Note issue in Australia cannot, however, be accurately estimated in advance. Nor can the changes that may occur in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the public, on the one hand, and by the banking system, on the other, be predicted accurately. </para>

On the basis of existing legislation, it is estimated that sales tax collections will increase by  $54,1 99,000  or  7 . 9  per cent to  $737,000,000,  following an increase of  $49,642,000  in  1971-72.

The measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to reduce income tax collections from individuals by  $432,200,000  in  1972-73.

For the purpose of estimating pay-as-you-earn collections, an increase of  9.0  per cent has been assumed as the increase in average earnings for  1972-73.  This assumption, which takes account of the rise in average weekly earnings which has already occurred, does not imply that the trend in earnings from this point of time can be forecast with reliability. Nor does its use imply that it is a budget objective. The increase in the average number of employees in  1972-73  in terms of 'male units' is assumed to be  2 . 0  per cent, a little above that experienced in  1971-72. </para>

        <para>SUMMARY</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The budget estimates and outcome for 1971-72, in conventional terms, are summarised in the following table. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The overall budget result was a deficit of $187 million, compared with the original budget estimate of a deficit of $11 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The outcome of the 1971-72 budget was affected to a significant degree by the policy measures adopted by the Government during the year to meet developing economic trends. New policy measures introduced since the budget was tabled in August 1971 are estimated to have added approximately $140 million to Commonwealth expenditures and to have reduced revenues by about $12 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The measures introduced included increased rates of nursing home benefits, increases in the State works and housing programmes, additional revenue grants to the States, additional payments to the States for education purposes and grants to the States for relief of unemployment in non-metropolitan areas. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In February 1972, the monthly rate of expenditure on non-metropolitan unemployment relief grants, which had been introduced in December 1971, was doubled, additional revenue grants and increased grants and advances for the State works and housing programmes were made available, unemployment benefit rates were increased, and the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment was restored. This latter measure did not, of course, affect revenues during 1971-72. In April, age, invalid, widows and certain war and service pension rates were increased and the levy on personal income tax was reduced from S per cent to 2} pet cent, applying effectively for the last quarter of the year. </para>
        <para>EXPENDITURES</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The budget estimates for 1971-72 are compared with actual expenditures for that year in the following table: </para>

            <para>The budget estimate for 1971-72 included $63 million for payments to be financed under credit arrangements with the United States of America; the actual amount financed from this source was $44 million. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
      </quote>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main variations from the budget estimates, including the new policy measures mentioned earlier, were as follows: </para>
          <para>Defence Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditure on defence services was $35 million less than the budget estimate. Service pay and civil salaries were $7 million more than the budget estimate largely due to the implementation of the Kerr Committee recommendations on pay for service officers and because of civil salary and wage determinations made after the budget. Against this there were shortfalls in other areas of expenditure. Actual expenditure on purchase and manufacture of aircraft for the RAN and RAAF fell short of the budget estimate by $15 million due mainly to re-phasing of payments on the F111C aircraft, medium-lift and utility helicopters and to deferment in ordering certain equipment for the RAN HS748 aircraft. Mainly due to lags in deliveries of certain items and non-receipt of bills, expenditure on stores and equipment for the RAN and RAAF was $13 million less than the estimate. Because of the deferment of some projects and lower expenditure than was expected following withdrawal from Vietnam, expenditure on arms, armament and equipment for the Army was $8 million less than the budget estimate. Expenditure on naval construction was $4 million less due to delays encountered on certain projects. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Works and Housing Programmes</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to or for the States and works and housing programmes were a net $124 million greater than the budget estimate. New policy measures were the major factor contributing to this increase. General revenue payments were $70 million greater than the budget estimate and included additional assistance of $32.5 million as a result of decisions announced at the February 1972 Premiers' Conference. Of this latter amount, $17.5 million was in the form of a special advance to New South Wales. In addition, because average wages increased more rapidly than had been anticipated, the operation of the formula under which the financial assistance grants are determined resulted in an increase of $28 million in these grants over the budget estimate. Special grants exceeded the budget estimate by $9 million following the Government's adoption of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's recommendation in March 1972 on Queensland's application for a special grant. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Specific purpose payments of a revenue nature were a net $31 million greater than the budget estimate, mainly as a result of the introduction of the non-metropolitan unemployment relief grants in December 1971. These grants amounted to $27 million in 1971-72. Payments to independent schools were $5 million more than the budget estimate because of the decision announced in December 1971 to increase per capita grants to these schools. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Specific purpose payments of a capital nature were a net $9 million less than the budget estimate. Short-falls in capital payments for education purposes included $3 million for colleges of advanced education, $2 million for teachers colleges and $2 million for technical training. An offset to these, introduced in December 1971, was $7 million capital grants to government schools. Other shortfalls from the budget estimates occurred in the fields of softwood forestry and railway projects. These were $4 million and $3 million respectively below the budget provisions. In addition, although $2 million was provided in the budget for the Gladstone Power Station, no payments were made because of delays in meeting the provisions of the agreement relating to sales of electric power. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the States for works and housing programmes were $32 million greater than estimated in the budget as a result of increased programmes agreed at the Australian Loan Council meeting in February 1972. </para>
          <para>National Welfare Fund</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the National Welfare Fund exceeded the budget estimate by $58 million. Expenditures on age, invalid and widows pensions were $9 million greater largely because of the increases in pension rates and the restoration, in April 1972, of the normal operation of the tapered means test. Payments of unemployment and sickness benefits were $18 million more than estimated because of the increased rates of benefit announced in February 1972 and a larger than anticipated increase in the number of benefit recipients. Child endowment payments fell short of the budget provision by $2 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditures on national health services were $31 million greater than estimated. The largest increase was in payments of nursing home benefits which exceeded the budget estimate by $19 million; this was attributable to increases in rates of benefits in October 1971. Expenditure on medical benefits exceeded the budget estimate by $9 million and pharmaceutical benefits, including benefits to pensioners, were $5 million greater than estimated. The latter arose from a greater than anticipated increase in the utilization of drugs covered by the scheme and increased average costs of drugs prescribed. </para>
          <para>Repatriation Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In total, expenditure on repatriation services was close to the budget estimate. Expenditure on repatriation institutions was $2 million greater than estimated largely because of increased costs arising from wage determinations for staff employed by these institutions. Pensions and allowances paid to ex-servicemen and their dependants were $3 million less than estimated because there were fewer recipients of these payments than had been assumed. Expenditure on other benefits was $1 million less than anticipated. </para>
          <para>Debt Charges</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Debt charges were $9 million less than estimated. Lower discount rates on Treasury Notes issued during the year contributed to the reduction. </para>
          <para>Departmental Running Expenses</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Departmental running expenses were $13 million greater than the budget estimate. Wage and salary payments were $10 million more than estimated principally- because of arbitration and other determinations brought down after the budget was presented. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Territories (excluding Papua New Guinea)</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure in the Territories was $4 million more than the budget estimate. Expenditures in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory were each $2 million more due mainly to increased wage and salary costs. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">External Economic Aid (including Papua New Guinea)</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on external economic aid was $12 million greater than the budget provision. Payments to the International Development Association were $4 million above the estimate reflecting greater calls on Australia in 1971-72 by the Association than were expected when the budget was presented. Emergency relief for Pakistani refugees and rehabilitation and relief payments to Bangladesh amounted to $3 million more than was provided in the budget. Payments in respect of allowances and other benefits for overseas officers of the Papua New Guinea public service were $2 million greater as a consequence of wage increases awarded in Australia and drawings on the Arawa loan by the Papua New Guinea Administration were $2 million more than estimated. Special aid to Indonesia and payments to the Indus Waters Scheme were each $1 million greater than the respective budget provisions. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth Payments to Industry</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In total these payments were $31 million greater than the budget estimate. Wheat stabilization payments exceeded the estimate by $31 million largely because stabilization payments were made in respect of both the 1969-70 and 1970-71 wheat pools. It was originally thought that the 1970-71 pool would not be finalized during 1971-72 and hence no provision for it was included in the budget estimates. Bounty payments on phosphate fertilizers exceeded the budget estimate by $8 million because of the improvement in rural conditions which led to a greater than expected use of phosphate fertilizers. Export incentive rebates were $6 million above the budget estimate because of a greater than expected increase in exports eligible under the scheme. Deficiency payments for wool were $7 million less than the estimate, reflecting the improvement in wool prices in the latter half of 1971-72. The amount of $4 million provided in the budget for advances to the Australian Wool Commission against possible loss on its trading operations in 1971-72 was not required. Expenditure on marginal dairy farm reconstruction was $4 million less than estimated. </para>
          <para>Other Expenditures</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other expenditures were $5 million more than the budget estimate but this was the outcome of a number of offsetting changes. The larger variations included an increase of $6 million in net Commonwealth superannuation payments which resulted from higher entitlements for new superannuitants arising from increased salaries, and from a larger than estimated number of pensioners and higher rates of pension. Increased university fees were largely responsible for expenditure on Commonwealth scholarships exceeding the budget estimate by $2 million. Expenditure on broadcasting and television services was also $2 million above the budget estimate. Expenditure on the assisted migrants' passage scheme was $4 million less than estimated, reflecting the reduced number of assisted immigrants. </para>
          <para>Advances for Capital Purposes</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In total, advances for capital purposes differed only slightly from the budget estimate, being less by a net $3 million, but there were variations in several of the components. The Post Office received an extra $15 million to help sustain its capital programme and because of a shortfall in expected revenue. Advances to Qantas were $12 million less than anticipated because their programme of aircraft purchases was not completed. As provided in the budget an advance of $10 million was paid to the Australian Wool Commission, but following an increase in demand, sales of wool enabled the Commission to repay the advance. Advances for War Service Homes exceeded the budget estimate by $5 million. </para>
          <para>Other Capital Works and Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on other capital works and services was very close to the budget estimate. Outlay on buildings and works for the Department of Civil Aviation was $1 million greater than estimated because of accelerated progress on the Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport runway extensions and the settlement of claims for the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport runway extensions. Expenditure on works for the Department of Health in the Northern Territory exceeded the budget provision by $1 million, due mainly to accelerated progress on the Nhulunbuy hospital. The increase of $1 million in the National Capital Development Commission's vote resulted from the re-assessment of the Commission's requirement for 1971-72 in the light of increased contract payments due to rises in wages and prices. Progress on the Port Augusta- Whyalla railway was not as rapid as expected and there was a shortfall of $2 million in the estimated expenditure on that project. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">The budget estimates for 1971-72 are compared with actual receipts in the following table: </para>
      <para class="block">The main variations from the budget estimates were: </para>
          <para>Customs Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of customs duty fell short of the budget estimate by $65 million because dutiable imports in 1971-72 were substantially less than had been assumed at the time of the budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Excise duty collections were 830 million more than estimated mainly because clearances of motor spirit and tobacco products were greater than assumed </para>
          <para>Sales Tax</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sales tax collections were $12 million less than estimated. This shortfall related mainly to lower than anticipated sales of motor vehicles. Sales of other goods in the IS per cent and <inline font-style="italic">21i</inline> per cent rate classes were also not as great as originally estimated. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Individuals - Pay-as-you-earn</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions were only $2 million short of the budget estimate but there were offsetting variations from the assumed changes in average earnings and average employment. In addition, the reduction in the rates of tax instalment deductions which operated from April 1972 had the effect of reducing P.A.Y.E. collections in May and June 1972. P.A.Y.E. refunds, however, were $31 million less than the budget estimate with the result that the net P.A.Y.E. revenue exceeded the estimate by $30 million. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Individuals - Collections on Assessments</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections on assessments of income tax on individuals exceeded the budget estimate by $76 million because business incomes in 1970-71 (assessed to tax in 1971-72) were larger than estimated and collection rates were greater than had been assumed at the time of the budget. In addition, collections on assessments of prior years were greater than had been estimated. </para>
          <para>Income Tax - Companies</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Company income tax collections fell short of the estimate by $37 million because company incomes in 1970-71 (assessed to tax in 1971-72) were less than estimated. </para>
          <para>Estate Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of estate duty were $11 million less than estimated because the average value of assessments was lower than expected. </para>
          <para>Other Revenue</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were some significant but largely offsetting variations <inline font-style="italic">in the</inline> components of other revenue, resulting in a relatively small net shortfall of $2 million from the budget estimate. Receipts from the defence departments were, in total, $7 million greater than estimated mainly because of higher than expected returns from disposals of stores and also because an amount of about $2 million was received in compensation for an 'Orion' aircraft destroyed in the United States of America in 1968. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Repayments of interest and principal on War Service Homes advances, net of refunds under S.39a(2) of the Act, were $5 million more than estimated because of a higher than anticipated rate of repayment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Miscellaneous revenue from the Australian Capital Territory and receipts of interest and principal repayments under the war service land settlement scheme were each $2 million greater than the budget estimate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts from Reserve Bank profits in 1971-72 fell short of the budget estimate by $17 million, reflecting certain consequences of changes in international currency values during the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net receipts from Commonwealth Railways were $4 million less than estimated because operating costs were higher and revenue was less than expected. </para>

After excluding loan proceeds from advance subscriptions received before 30 June 1971 but including receipts from outstanding instalments and advance subscriptions received up to 30 June 1972, the proceeds from these cash loans totalled $754 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of Special Bonds during the year totalled $139 million. Proceeds of $24 million from State domestic loan raisings brought total cash proceeds from loans raised in Australia to $917 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Of the $890 million of securities (other than Special Bonds) maturing in Australia which were offered for conversion in 1971-72, an amount of 589 million was redeemed. Redemptions of Special Bonds of all series amounted to $92 million. Other redemptions, market repurchases and contractual repayments in Australia amounted to $15 million. Total redemptions and repurchases in Australia were, therefore, $197 million, so that net proceeds of loans raised in Australia in 1971-72 were $720 million. </para>

          <title>STATEMENT No. 7 - COMMONWEALTH BUDGET TRANSACTIONS SINCE 1962-63</title>
          <page.no>108</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The tables shown later in this Statement set out Commonwealth budget receipts and expenditure in both 'conventional' and national accounts form. Comparisons of budget revenues and expenditures between 1971-72 and 1972-73 and between 1971-72 and previous years are affected by the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States as from 1 September 1971. Details of the arrangements relating to the transfer of pay-roll tax are set out in the document Commonwealth Payments to or for the States 1972-73' presented concurrently with the budget. Although the full effects of the pay-roll tax transfer are not readily eliminated from the series, estimates of the impact of the transfer on Commonwealth revenues and expenditures in 1971-72 and 1972-73 have been made and are presented later in this Statement. For the years prior to 1971-72, the figures on Commonwealth budget transactions are broadly consistent, subject to the qualifications outlined in the notes to the tables. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Tables 1 and 2 on pages 116 and 117 show Commonwealth expenditures, receipts and financing transactions in 'conventional' form for each year since 1962-63. This presentation is essentially a rearrangement of the transactions of the three Commonwealth Funds within the Public Account (Consolidated Revenue Fund, Loan Fund and Trust Fund). </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 on pages 118 and 1 19 shows figures in national accounts form for each year since 1962-63. In this form, transfers between different parts of the Commonwealth's accounts are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government and the rest of the economy or overseas. The national accounts figures therefore show government transactions classified into economically significant categories, corresponding with those presented in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth contributes to the growth of public sector outlays both directly through its budget expenditures and indirectly through the operations of its instrumentalities in the non-budget sector. The following table shows details of the average annual rates of growth of the main components of <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth budget outlays,</inline> for the period 1962-63 to 1971-72, compared with the average annual rate of growth in gross national expenditure over the same period. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">These figures show the somewhat faster growth rate of total budget outlays relative to that of gross national expenditure. The transfer of pay-roll tax to the States and the associated reduction in financial assistance grants paid by the Commonwealth has, moreover, had the effect of reducing the average annual growth rates of transfer payments and hence total Commonwealth budget outlays. It is estimated that in the absence of the transfer, total Commonwealth budget outlays would have grown at an annual average rate of 10.7 per cent, whilst the average annual growth rate of transfer payments would have been 11.2 per cent. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Net expenditure on goods and services has clearly been the fastest growing component of total outlay, averaging an annual rate of increase over the decade to 1971-72 of 12 . 7 per cent. This is indicative of a significant increase in the Commonwealth's direct call on resources over the period, and reflects, in turn, the increasing demands made by the community on the Government. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is to be noted in this connexion, however, that a large part of Commonwealth outlay is in the form of transfer payments, such as payments of pensions, subsidies and interest and grants and net advances to other sectors of the economy. In 1971-72, such payments amounted to almost three-quarters of the total Commonwealth outlays. This is an important distinction, since the effect on the economy of these transfers and advances naturally depends on the reactions of the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Growth in the relative size of the public sector as a whole (that is, Commonwealth, State and local government) cannot, of course, be assessed by reference to Commonwealth budget outlay figures alone. Estimates of total public sector outlay as a proportion of gross national expenditure, together with figures for the proportion of gross national expenditure represented by total public sector expenditures on goods and services, are set out in the following table. There is a minor break in the series in 1967-68 arising from the inclusion of expenditures relating to a number of small semi-government authorities. This change tends to inflate slightly the proportions shown for the years following 1967-68. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total public sector outlays as a percentage of gross national expenditure grew from 29.3 per cent in 1962-63 to 33.2 per cent in 1971-72. The major lift in public sector outlays relative to gross national expenditure occurred in the period 1965-66 to 1967-68 reflecting, among other things, expenditures on major defence re-equipment programmes. Since that time, the share of total public sector outlays has remained relatively stable, with the increase in 1971-72 affected in part by the slowdown in private sector expenditures. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Similarly, the <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> demands placed on resources by the public sector have grown unevenly over the period. After the relatively strong growth from 18.8 per cent in 1962-63 to 22 .0 per cent in 1967-68, public sector expenditure on goods and services as a proportion of gross national expenditure has remained relatively stable - fluctuating between 21.4 per cent and 22.5 per cent. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The apparent stability in the relative share of public sector expenditures in gross national expenditure over recent years, however, masks somewhat divergent movements in the major components of public sector expenditures. <inline font-style="italic">Current</inline> expenditure on goods and services, for example, has steadily increased its relative share in gross national expenditure from 10.1 per cent in 1962-63 to 13.5 per cent in 1971-72. By way of contrast, public <inline font-style="italic">capital</inline> expenditures as a proportion of gross national expenditure rose from 8.7 per cent in 1962-63 to reach a peak of 9.7 per cent in 196S-66, but have since declined as a proportion of gross national expenditure to account for 9.0 per cent in 1971-72. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the decade to 1971-72, increasing priority has been given to both current and capital expenditures for the provision of basic community services such as education, public health and welfare and communications. In 1971-72, education accounted for 26.2 per cent of total public sector current expenditures on goods and services, and public health and welfare 14.2 per cent, whilst almost one half of total capital expenditures in 1971-72 was directed to the provision of transport and communication facilities. In the mid 1960s the proportion of total public authority current expenditures devoted to defence increased substantially; however, the rate of growth in these expenditures slowed in the latter part of the decade as major re-equipment programmes were completed. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The allocation of funds to the various social objectives of education, health, and the provision of public utilities may also be examined in terms of the so-called 'conventional' budget classification. Although provision for these objectives is in large part the responsibility of the States, the Commonwealth provides a significant part of the financial resources enabling such provision to be made by the States. The allocation to the States of funds which are spent mainly in areas of prime State responsibility such as the provision of education and health services, the construction and maintenance of roads, and the provision of housing, water supply and sewerage facilities, can be seen by reference to the following table which is in the conventional budget classification. As the following table shows, $1,673 million or almost one third of the total increase of $5,301 million in Commonwealth expenditures over the decade to 1971-72 is attributable to payments to or for the States and works and housing programmes. Some of these funds are provided for specific purposes, but the allocation of the larger part of them rests with the States. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="079131197208151_107_38.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main <inline font-style="italic">absolute</inline> growth in expenditures after payments to or for the States has been in respect of the provision of social service benefits, provided via the National Welfare Fund. Almost one fifth of the total increase in Commonwealth expenditure between 1962-63 and 1971-72 has related to this item. The provision of new and increased social service benefits, including the introduction of the tapered means test, and the extension of existing schemes have all contributed to the growth in National Welfare Fund payments over the period. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence services accounted for a further 14. 8 per cent of the total increase in Commonwealth expenditures over the decade to 1971-72. The major re-equipment programmes of the mid 1960s account for a significant portion of the growth of defence expenditures. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In terms of growth rates, the top-ranking expenditures for the decade were Commonwealth payments to industry (20.9 per cent per annum); expenditure on Commonwealth Territories (16.8 per cent per annum) and departmental running expenses (15.3 per cent per annum). At the lower end of the scale, expenditures on repatriation services have, despite substantial increases in benefit rates, grown at an average rate of only 6.3 per cent per annum, mainly because there has been only a slow increase in the number of beneficiaries. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The growing range of support provided to rural industry has been the main factor accounting for the above average increase of 20.9 per cent per annum in direct Commonwealth payments to industry. The increase of $88 million - an average of 16.8 per cent per annum - in expenditure on Commonwealth Territories largely reflects the cost of servicing the rapid growth of Canberra and Darwin. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the decade to 1971-72 total Commonwealth employment is estimated to have grown at more than double the rate for total civilian employment. This rate of increase in government employment, associated with a rapid growth in wages and salaries, particularly during the latter half of the decade, is reflected in the average annual growth rate of 15.3 per cent in departmental running expenses. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the receipts side, <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> budget receipts in national accounts terms have increased at an annual average rate of 11.5 per cent - rising from 20.5 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1962-63 to 24.8 per cent in 1971-72. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The following table shows the composition of the increase in Commonwealth budget receipts, in national accounts terms, over the period 1962-63 to 1971-72, together with the average annual rates of growth for the individual revenue headings. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="079131197208151_108_39.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In absolute terms, the increase in income tax collections from individuals outranked all other sources of revenue, accounting for about 48 per cent of the increase in total receipts over the decade to 1971-72. By far the larger part of the increase was in respect of net pay-as-you-earn income tax from wage and salary earners, reflecting the operation of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in wage and salary incomes. The average annual rate of growth in net receipts from this source was no less than 17.4 per cent compared with an average annual growth rate for total receipts of 11.5 per cent. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from company income taxes also increased more rapidly than total receipts, having an average annual rate of growth of 12.4 per cent over the period and accounting for 17.9 per cent of the total increase in receipts. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">By way of contrast, indirect tax revenues increased at an average annual rate of 8.4 per cent over the decade and accounted for 23.4 per cent of the total increase in revenues. To some extent the relatively slow growth in revenues from this source is the result of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States as from 1 September 1971. However, after adjustment to remove the effects of this change, indirect tax revenues still show an average rate of growth over the decade which is significantly lower than the rate of growth of total receipts. This arises largely because expenditures on taxable items have increased less rapidly than incomes and because many products are subject to specific rates which have been changed only at irregular intervals. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the decade to 1971-72, the Commonwealth has consistently incurred a deficit on its budgetary transactions. The size of the deficit, however, has fluctuated from year to year, reaching a peak of $642 million in 1967-68 and a low of $7 million in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Any economic assessment of these budget results would, of course, have to take into account the composition of domestic receipts and expenditures in each year because of the differing economic impact of particular types of expenditure and receipts, the proportion of expenditures made overseas, and the level of activity in the economy at the time. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main financing transactions, undertaken to meet the deficits in the Commonwealth budget over the period have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes and temporary borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Net loan proceeds from overseas reached a peak of $142 million in 1968-69, in spite of a large reduction in the net amounts available from drawings against defence credits and aircraft loans. In subsquent years, however, redemptions and repayments of debt overseas have exceeded gross loan proceeds. Net proceeds from loan raisings in Australia and Treasury Notes reached a peak of $711 million in 1971-72  -  the previous maximum during the period was an amount of $506 million in 1962-63. </para>
        <para>NOTES ON TABLES 1 AND 2: FIGURES IN 'CONVENTIONAL' TERMS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">At the Premiers' Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth would cease to levy pay-roll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own pay-roll taxes as from the same date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue to the Commonwealth, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the estimates for 1972-73. Details of the arrangements concerning the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States are given in the document 'Commonwealth Payments to or for the States 1972-73' presented with the budget. </para>

An amount of $3,036,000 has been provided in the Budget to meet the first instalment of the paid-in portion of the proposed increase in Australia's subscription to the capital stock of the Asian Development Bank as set out in the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill now before Parliament: no similar payment was made in 1971-72. Total calls on Australia's existing contribution to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund of the Asian Development Bank and a proposed further contribution of $US250,000 to its Technical Assistance Special Fund this year are together expected to result in expenditures $1,223,000 greater than in 1971-72. The estimates also provide for increases in Australia's pledges to the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and the U.N. Development Programme in 1973. The estimated increase of $283,000 in expenditure on the International Rice Research Institute at Los Banos in the Philippines in 1972-73 relates to the design, purchase and installation of a phytotron to assist research activities at the Institute. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Normal grant aid to the Administration of Papua New Guinea will be increased by $13,131,000, or 12.1 per cent, to a total of $121,300,000 in 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The basic Grant-in-aid will remain constant at $30 million but the Development Grant will be $8,625,000 greater and the provision for Allowances and Other Benefits for Overseas Officers employed in the Papua New Guinea Public Service will be increased by $4,506,000 to permit an expansion in recruitment and also allow for the flow-on effects of recent wage increases granted in Australia. There will be no payments in respect of the Arawa loan in 1972-73 as this was fully drawn last year. However, an interest-free loan of $3 million repayable over 15 years including a grace period of three years will be provided to the Administration in 1972-73 to enable the Papua New Guinea Investment Corporation to purchase the shares in Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd (a plywood manufacturing concern at Bulolo) which were previously held by the Commonwealth. In addition, special financial assistance estimated at $3,500,000 will be provided to the Administration this year to enable it to take over the functions previously performed in Papua New Guinea by certain Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities which are being withdrawn as the move towards self-government and eventual independence proceeds: a large part of this amount will be devoted to the purchase of Commonwealth assets in Papua New Guinea. The provision for on-the-job training of Papua New Guineans in Australia has been increased by $212,000 to a total of $450,000 in 1972-73 and a further $500,000, or $414,000 more than in 1971-72, has been provided for the training of Papua New Guineans in administrative principles and procedures etc., at the Australian School of Pacific Administration (ASOPA), which was recently adapted for this purpose. Finally, expenditure on flying training scholarships for indigenous pilots in Papua New Guinea is estimated to be $50,000 greater in 1972-73. </para>

The imputed costs involved in this 'hidden aid subsidy' are estimated to exceed $10 million per annum at the present time. </para>

This figure includes estimated expenditures on the training of military personnel under Special Aid to the Khmer Republic. The principal recipients will be Malaysia, $6,200,000; Indonesia, $3,800,000; South Vietnam, $2,164,000; and Singapore, $963,000.

          <para>Australia's Relative Aid Performance</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">International comparisons of aid performances by different donor countries are subject to numerous reservations because of conceptual problems and statistical difficulties. Some of these were outlined in Statement No. 8 attached to the 1971-72 Budget Speech. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Nevertheless, leaving <inline font-style="italic">defence</inline> aid on one side as this does not necessarily contribute to economic growth and well-being in recipient countries, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development regularly publishes data on this subject in an attempt to provide some measure of burden-sharing and to compare the relative aid efforts by its member countries, including Australia, in helping to raise living standards in developing countries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following table compiled by the DAC shows the performance of member countries in recent years in terms of the net flow of total official and private resources to developing countries expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product. On the basis of that yardstick, Australia, with a provisional figure of 1 .27 per cent in 1971 (compared with 1 .22 per cent in 1970) is currently ranked third in the world. However, as the figures for Australia itself and for other countries confirm, such flows can and do fluctuate widely from year to year, largely for reasons beyond the influence and control of governments. In Australia's case, for example, the sharp jump in the figures for 1970 and 1971 resulted principally from the large private capital flows to Papua New Guinea associated with the Bougainville copper project and from a substantial growth in private export credits, primarily related to wheat sales to developing countries, much of which has been officially insured. For reasons which are well illustrated by these examples, this method of assessing relative aid performances leaves much to be desired. </para>
        <para>NET FLOW OF TOTAL OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Note: The figures for 1970 and 1971 include estimated contributions by voluntary aid organizations and are, to that extent, not strictly comparable with those for earlier years. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A far more meaningful way of assessing relative aid performances is to compare only the <inline font-style="italic">official development assistance</inline> provided by each donor country expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product. This concept excludes private investment flows as well as export credits (whether official or private) extended to developing countries and contributions by voluntary aid organizations, etc. It has certain deficiencies, from the point of view of a grant aid donor like Australia, in that it still lumps grants and loans together as if they were the same - which, of course, they are not - and fails to deduct interest payments by developing countries. Nevertheless, it is widely used as a measure of burden-sharing, etc. at the present time. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On this basis, Australia ranked fourth in the world in  1971  with a figure of  0.52  per cent. Comparable figures for all DAC countries in each year since  1968  are shown in the following table:- </para>
        <para>NET OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The apparent deterioration in Australia's performance in 1971 resulted from a bunching of expenditures in the previous year which had the effect of distorting the underlying trend. Thus, the comparable figure for the financial year 1971-72 was 0.56 per cent. There seems little doubt that the figure for Australia in 1972 will be higher than that for 1971, given the further increases in aid which have been provided for in the Budget. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition to volume, increasing emphasis is now also being placed on international comparisons of the terms on which official development assistance is provided, in view of the serious external debt servicing problems which many developing countries face at the present time. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Australia's aid has always been provided on extremely 'soft* terms. Indeed, until a few years ago it was all given in grant form. Early in 1970, however, a loan of $20 million on concessional terms was approved for the Administration of Papua New Guinea to help finance the construction of a new township at Arawa in connexion with the Bougainville copper project. As previously mentioned in this Statement, a further loan of $3 million will be provided to the Administration in 1972-73. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to Australian industry is provided through the budget by way of bounties, subsidies and other payments, and by way of contributions to promotion and research. In addition, services and facilities are provided by the Commonwealth for which no charge is made or for which charges fall well short of covering the costs incurred. A large part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which it is estimated $56 million will be provided from Consolidated Revenue in 1972-73, is on activities undertaken for the benefit of Australian industry. Commonwealth departments providing assistance in the form of services and facilities include Primary Industry, Trade and Industry (including the Australian Tourist Commission), National Development (Bureau of Mineral Resources, and Forestry and Timber Bureau), Civil Aviation and Labour and National Service. Assistance to improve the defence capability of Australian industry is provided in a number of ways from the Defence Vote. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has provided substantial assistance to the rural sector in recent years by way of natural disaster relief payments to the States, the largest of which has been reimbursement of State expenditure on drought relief schemes. A number of other specific purpose grants to the States also assist primary industries - for instance, payments for beef cattle roads, brigalow lands development, and water resources investigations and projects. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition, a very considerable amount of assistance is being provided through the budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Commonwealth revenues (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients), are as much a call on the budget as direct payments which add to expenditures. Assistance of this type is provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their incomes for taxation purposes beyond those normally permitted under the income tax law. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1971-72 through the main taxation concessions for which figures are shown below, is estimated to have been more than $304 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Most, though not all, of that amount is forgone through concessions in the income tax law, which are shown in some detail below. (Pay-roll tax rebates, under the export incentive scheme, in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years, are shown in the section headed 'Commonwealth Payments to Industry'.) Special estate duty reliefs for primary production estates were introduced in the financial year 1969-70. There are numerous concessions to industry in the sales tax field in the form of special exemptions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A those which allow the deduction of larger amounts than are authorized under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which gives a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deduction from income for this expenditure); </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">B those which allow certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
      <para>C those which exempt certain classes of income. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main provisions in each of these classes and the estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1971-72 are shown in the table on page 80. The table does not include the cost of the averaging provisions applied to incomes of 'primary producers'. These provisions involve assessment at rates of tax which may differ from those otherwise applicable to the taxable income. They have the effect of reducing the tax otherwise payable in a year when taxable income exceeds the average of that year and the four preceding years. It may exceed the average because of fluctuations in income, or because incomes had generally risen over the period, or both. Conversely, if taxable income falls below average income, tax payable under these provisions is higher than it would otherwise be. Options allowed by the law to withdraw permanently from the averaging provisions, or to re-enter them, have enabled 'primary producers' to have applied either tax at general rates or tax under </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table also takes no account of the effect on revenue of the drought bonds scheme which commenced in 1969-70. This scheme enables eligible pastoralists to reduce their taxable incomes in some years, by the amounts they subscribe to drought bonds, and increase them in later years, by amounts of redemptions. By evening out fluctuations in taxable income, the scheme can enable them to make an overall saving in tax. The cost of the scheme to revenue up to 30 June 1972 is estimated at about $600,000. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to industry is also provided by the exemption from income tax of the remuneration of certain 'visiting experts' during a visit to Australia, where the remuneration is not free from income tax in the country where the visitor ordinarily resides. A related concession is the rebate which may be allowed in the case of visiting experts, which in effect reduces the Australian income tax payable on the visitor's remuneration to the amount of tax that he would have had to pay in his own country if he had earned the remuneration there. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">With increasing mining production and continuing expenditure on exploration, it is probable that there will be continuing and, in some cases, increasing costs to revenue of the various income tax concessions which apply to the mining and mining exploration industries. In particular, increased production of bauxite and the other prescribed minerals, income from which is partly exempted under section 23a, is likely to result in greater revenue losses in future years. Section 23a of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides for the exemption from income tax of one-fifth of the net income from the production or sale of certain prescribed metals and minerals. Also, with the growth in income from Australian petroleum (both oil and natural gas) there will be a continuing cost to revenue of the special allowances permitted for petroleum-producing enterprises. These allowances effectively free from tax income from the sale of Australian petroleum and its products, until capital expenditure incurred in finding and recovering the petroleum (other than such expenditure transferred for deduction against shareholders' income by reason of section 77d), has been recouped out of the mining profits. Dividends paid out of such tax-free income are exempt in the hands of shareholders of the mining and petroleum companies. </para>

            <para>This estimate is based on the deductions allowable in the 1970-71 income year in respect of purchases and appro priations in that year len the depreciation that would have been allowable in that year on the relevant plant purchases or the plant in respect of which the appropriations were made. While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Commonwealth budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the va'ue to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account wilh the taxation revenue. </para>

In addition, there are certain taxation concessions having welfare aspects granted to taxpayers under the income tax law and the sales tax law.

Included in the above total is an amount of $30m as an Advance to the Treasurer for the purposes set out in the Bill. The proposed expenditures in this Bill were dealt with as appropriate in my Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para>- I support the motion. The papers we are ordering to be printed are the last will and testament of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden).</inline> They deserve to be printed as the testimony of liberalism at its last gasp after 23 years. These papers record the results of monumental failures and in particular the results of the monumental blunder of last year's Budget. This is what these papers reveal. The same Treasurer who has produced the worst unemployment since 1962 and who produced the Budget strategy deliberately designed to create that unemployment asks us now in these papers to accept that his Budget strategy this year is the best that can be devised for this nation. Will it get the 112,000 acknowledged unemployed men and women promptly back to work? It will not. </para>

          <para>- Order! The motion is that these papers be printed. I do not think this gives any member, including the Leader of the Opposition, the right to cover matters outside the scope of the motion or to talk about the economy or what happened last year. The motion is quite clear. It is that the papers be printed. I think the Leader of the Opposition should confine himself to the terms of the motion. </para>

In lost production alone the Treasurer cost us, as the papers reveal, $800m. It can be traced in the various tables on revenue and taxation in these papers.

            <para>-I must say that on a motion that papers be printed it is most unusual to have a debate covering the whole range of national income, Commonwealth income tax statistics and the cost to the economy. The Leader of the House has asked me for a ruling on this matter. I will say that the Leader of the Opposition will be out of order if he continues in this vein. The motion is that these papers be printed and this does not entitle any person in this chamber to debate the subject matter of these papers. Other opportunities are given to debate those matters. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that it is not the practice of the House to debate those matters at this time. </para>

            <para>- Speaking to the point of order I have raised, it is quite clear now that you have been assisted in interpreting the Standing Orders in the way that I have interpreted them in this House in the past. The motion that the House take note of a paper has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition and by Ministers in this House over the years. According to your interpretation there has to be a motion either that the paper be printed or that the House take note of the paper. Every time that a Minister moves in this House that the House take note of the paper every honourable member in this House is enabled to debate that motion. I do not want to canvass your ruling but with due deference to you I make the point that in view of your own interpretation of this standing order the Leader of the Opposition is in order. I believe that he was quite correct in giving his interpretation of the papers in the way he was giving it. </para>

            <para>-Order! The honourable member cannot speak until I have finished. The motion that the House take note of the paper is one alternative. The question before the House, that the paper be printed, is another alternative. The Minister at the table has moved that the paper be printed, not that the House take note of the paper. If the Minister had moved that the House take note of the paper a debate would have been in order, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has suggested. But the Minister has moved that the paper be printed and, therefore, I cannot allow a full debate. </para>

            <para>- For much too long - for 35 years - to allow this procedure to pass without comment. In those 35 years - yes, indeed, too long - the procedure that has always been followed has been that a Budget Speech has been made and the Leader of the Opposition has asked for the adjournment of the debate until a week later. He may the next day or that night have issued some preliminary statement to the Press but I have never known in 35 years the kind of procedure that the Leader of the Opposition is attempting- </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you have based your ruling on standing order 322, which was amended as recently as 13th April this year. I was on the Standing Orders Committee which suggested this amendment which was adopted by the House. I do not believe that any honourable members appreciated that under this standing order which authorises 2 motions, firstly that the paper be printed or secondly that the House take note of the paper, that debate was precluded on the former but permitted on the latter. We assumed that debate would be permitted on either of those motions included in the same standing order. May I say with respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> you seem to be giving the ruling that this is one of those motions which are listed in standing order 86 on which there can be no debate. You have precluded me from giving arguments in favour of printing the papers; you have precluded my colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron),</inline> from giving arguments why they should not be printed. I suggest with respect that it is equally open to debate the motion that the paper be printed under standing order 322 as it is to debate the motion that the House take note of the paper under standing order 322. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Hindmarsh did not attempt to debate the motion, so I did not prevent him. Secondly, 1 have given a ruling on this matter and I think the Leader of the Opposition knows that what I have outlined has been the custom and the practice of the House for many years. The standing order was framed in that context. I inform the House that I was  Chairman  of the Committee that considered the standing order as well as being in attendance at its sitting, and that is the interpretation that I put on the standing order. </para>

            <para>- I take the point of order that on other occasions debate has taken place in this House on motions that papers be printed. It is a regular practice to debate reports of the Publications Committee and it was previously the practice to debate reports of the Printing Committee on motions to print the papers. I do not think there is any difference between that situation and the present circumstances. As there is no prohibition in the Standing Orders, I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> under what standing order you say that speaking on his motion to print the papers is out of order when on other occasions it is allowed. </para>

The honourable member for Bradfield, in the first and most lucid of his interventions, said that the usual practice was for the Leader of the Opposition to move the adjournment of the Budget debate. The Leader of the Opposition did that, but he believed that he was entitled under a Standing Order amended as recently as April this year to speak on another motion. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, you</inline> are not of that opinion. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to declare the rates of income tax for the current financial year 1972-73. The Bill will give effect to changes mentioned in my Budget Speech. The Bill's most significant feature is the new personal tax scale which will reduce tax payable by individuals by an average of 10 per cent. The new scale will apply free of any additional levy. It is estimated that, as compared with tax that would be payable if the existing scale and <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent levy were continued, the new scale will reduce income tax payments in 1972-73 by $380m and by $480m in a full year. </para>
          <para>As I said in my Budget Speech, the interaction of money incomes rising with inflation and the progressive rate scale has led to income taxation becoming too heavy a burden. The low income earner is contributing a proportion of his income in taxation far higher than 10 or IS years ago; the man on average weekly earnings or a little more is finding income taxation looming increasingly larger in his calculations; and the managerial or professional man is facing marginal rates of taxation which on any reasonable criteria are very high indeed. The new scale is designed to give the greatest percentage reductions in taxation at the lower end of the income scale. The tax payable on a taxable income of $2,000 will be reduced by 14.2 per cent. For a taxable income of $4,000 the reduction will be 12.4 per cent. At $10,000 the reduction will be 8 per cent and at $20,000, 6.6 per cent. </para>
          <para>If we are to make the large percentage reductions which we wish to see at the lower and medium income levels, the rate of progression of marginal tax rates would become very steep indeed if the point at which the maximum marginal rate becomes effective were to remain unchanged. That point, which was $32,000 under the scale existing since 1954-55, was altered in the course of the changes made in 1970-71 and is now $20,000. We propose to set a new point of $40,000 at which the new maximum rate of 66 2/3 per cent - that is, the present maximum rate but without the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent levy - will apply. These reductions in tax payable also will be fully reflected in tax payable by primary producers subject to the averaging provisions of the law and by taxpayers whose rate of tax is based on a notional income. </para>
          <para>The minimum taxable income for individuals will be raised by the Bill from $417 to $1,041. This new minimum will also apply in assessments of trustees on income of trust estates to which a beneficiary is presently entitled but is under a legal disability. As a consequence of the increase in the minimum taxable income in these cases changes are proposed in the 'shading-in' arrangements which apply to cushion the impact of moving from complete exemption into tax at normal rates. Tax at normal rates will commence to apply on taxable incomes above $1,120 instead of $428 as at present. For taxable incomes between $1,041 and $1,120 the tax payable will be limited to two-thirds of the amount by which the taxable income exceeds $1,040. The change in minimum taxable income, which will free some 600,000 taxpayers from tax, is estimated to reduce personal income tax payments by $14m in 1972-73 and by $18m in a full year. </para>
          <para>The present exemptions granted under the age allowance will remain for eligible people. Because of the reduction in the general rates of tax, however, tax as limited by the age allowance will now 'shade-in' to the general rate scale at $2,202 or, where the married couple provisions apply. $3,871. Schedules of tax instalment deductions to be made by employers from salaries or wages paid to employees are being revised in the light of the proposed reduction in tax rates and the increased minimum taxable income. The new schedules will have effect as from 1st September. Provisional tax payable in respect of the income year ending 30th June 1973 also will be adjusted to take account of the changes proposed by the Bill. </para>
          <para>Apart from the features I have mentioned, the provisions of the Bill have the same practical effect as corresponding legislation for the 1971-72 year. Technical aspects of the Bill are explained in the explanatory memorandum which is being circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill has 2 main provisions. One will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to increase concessional deductions for the maintenance of dependants. The other will provide a deduction for expenses of a taxpayer in obtaining educational qualifications connected with income-producing activities in cases where the expenses are not deductible under the present law. Both measures were foreshadowed in my Budget Speech. </para>
          <para>The amendments to the dependants allowances will mean that the maximum deductions available under the law for the maintenance of a spouse, a parent, a parent-in-law, a housekeeper and a daughter-housekeeper will each be advanced from $312 to $364. Similarly, deductions available for maintenance of a student, an invalid relative and for one child under 16 years of age will each move up from $208 to $260. For other children under 16 the deduction will be increased from $156 to $208. </para>
          <para>I have explained in my Budget Speech that these increases in dependants allowances, together with the reductions in income tax proposed by the Bill I have already introduced, are directed to easing the tax burdens of the family man and the single income family in particular. PAYE deductions from salaries and wages paid from 1st September 1972 will take both changes into account. </para>
          <para>The measure dealing with what have become known as self-education expenses is an important one. Many people spend money on educational courses with a view to obtaining qualifications to .aid them in earning income. This expenditure may not be deductible for income tax purposes because, according to long-standing principles on which the general deduction provisions of the income tax law are based, it is either not incurred in the course of producing income or is private expenditure. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided, however, that a concession should be available for people who set themselves the task of gaining educational qualifications connected with their careers. We therefore propose a special concessional deduction for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on fees, books and equipment associated with a course of education he undertakes for the purpose of acquiring qualifications related to his employment or career. The new concession will not be subject to any age qualification. It will be available whether a course of education is attended on a full-time or part-time basis or is carried on by correspondence. </para>
          <para>As is the case with the concession now provided to a parent for the education of children, the maximum deduction under the new concession in any income year will be S400. Also in line with the deduction granted to a parent, a deduction will not be allowable for expenses recouped under the Commonwealth scheme for secondary and technical scholarships. </para>
          <para>The new concession will complement the present allowance for education expenses and will be limited to the difference between the amount of $400 and any amount allowable to a parent or other person for the education expenses of the taxpayer. It is proposed that both the deduction for self-education expenses and the increased dependants allowances will be allowable in assessments based on income derived in the 1972-73 income year and subsequent years. </para>
          <para>The provisions of the Bill referring to provisional tax are consequential on the reductions in the general rates of tax and the increase in the minimum taxable income for the 1972-73 financial year proposed by the Income Tax Bill 1972. These provisions will have the effect that the reductions in personal income tax rates and the increased minimum taxable income for individuals will be fully reflected in amounts of provisional tax in respect of the 1972-73 income year. Technical aspects of the Bill are explained in a memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The sole purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to exempt from sales tax imported works of art. At present works of art produced in Australia are exempt from sales tax.. Exemptions for imported works fall into 2 classes. Those imported for public galleries or museums or otherwise for continuous free public exhibition are exempt. So also are works by Australian artists abroad or, within the terms of the New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement, by New Zealand artists. Importations by or for private collectors or commercial organisations of works by other than Australian or New Zealand artists are subject to sales tax at 15 per cent. </para>
          <para>The exemption in favour of works by Australian artists was introduced in the early days of sales tax as a measure of assistance to those artists. The Government considers that the development of Australian art is such that original purpose is no longer relevant. Moreover, the tax on imported works acts against the interests of public galleries which rely to a large extent on benefactions from private collectors. </para>
          <para>Works of art are largely exempt from Customs duty and the Government proposes that the sales tax discrimination against imported works should also be removed. The proposed exemption will complement the Customs provisions and will accordingly apply to paintings, drawings, sculptures, engravings and so on that are exempt from Customs duty. Imported paintings, drawings and pastels valued at $50 or less are subject to Customs duty and will remain subject to sales tax. It is customary for sales tax changes to be effective from the day after their introduction into Parliament and it is proposed that the exemption should come into operation tomorrow, 16th August 1972. A memorandum containing a more detailed explanation of the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

        <para class="block">Customs Tariff Proposals No. 13 (1972) and Excise Tariff Propoals No. 2 (1972), which I have just tabled, introduce tariff changes foreshadowed by my colleague, the honourable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> in his Budget Speech earlier this evening. These changes operate from tomorrow. The Propoals will permit the entry, free of excise of Customs duty, of tobacco, cigarettes, cigars ond snuff, for use in approved medical or other scientific research programmes. The Excise Tariff Proposals also introduce changes in respect of duties on gasoline and other shale spirit, and mineral turpentine, produced from shale mined in Australia. Formerly these products were entered free of duty. However, the need for the concession no longer exists and the opportunity is being taken to simplify the Excise Tariff. A summary of these alterations is being circulated to honourable members. </para>
        <para>I also tabled Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 9 to 12 (1972). These Proposals formally place before Parliament the tariff changes made while the Parliament was in recess. The were published by notice in Commonwealth Gazettes of 5th and 30th June and 3rd and 28th July 1972. The changes arise from the Government's decisions following receipt of the following Tariff Board reports: AC generators exceeding 120 kVA; rotary converters exceeding 50 kW; hand tools; interchangeable tools, etc.; shipbuilding; and shot angular grit and wire pellets of iron or steel. Other changes extend the list of commodities to which the New Zeland-Australia Free Trade Agreement applies. </para>
        <para>Honourable members were supplied with details of the changes in tariff protection by my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> at the times the Gazette notices were made. Proposals No. 10 (1972) provides for the conversion of all imperial measurements in the Customs Tariff to their metric equivalents in accordance with the Government's decision to adopt the metric system. Rates of duty have been adjusted accordingly. The Proposals also include amendments to align the Australian Customs Tariff with recent amendments to the Brussels Nomenclature. Any changes in duty rates are minimal. I commend the Proposals. </para>

          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The most recent overseas borrowing undertaken by the Commonwealth on its own account was made on the West German market in January 197Z The borrowing, of an amount of DM 100m (approximately $A25.4m), was for a term of 15 years with an interest rate of 7 per cent payable annually. The interest rate offered on long-term Commonwealth securities issued in local November 1971 cash loan was 6.7 per cent; the rate was reduced to 6 per cent in the subsequent February loan. </para>
        <para>There are important differences, in terms of their purposes and economic implications, between borrowings of foreign currency, overseas and borrowings in the local market, and it does not follow that an overseas borrowing should not be undertaken because an equivalent amount in local currency might be obtainable from additional local borrowings (which could have implications foi local interest rates) at a rate of interest lower than the rate prevailing at the time in the overseas market. </para>
        <para>The Government has considered it important to maintain access to large and important capital markets overseas. However, borrowings undertaken overseas have in recent years represented only a very small proportion of total Commonwealth borrowings. In the current financial year there will be a net reduction in the Commonwealth's overseas indebtedness. </para>

        </list>
        <para>Following the announcement of the establishment of a new pattern of exchange rates by members of the Group of Ten major industrial countries, the Australian Government decided on 22nd December 1971 that the gold parity of the Australian dollar would remain unchanged. However, taking advantage of the widening of the permitted margins about parity (  or - <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent), it was decided to establish the market rate for the Australian dollar on the United States dollar at approximately 2 per cent below the par rate. The fixing of this market rate has meant that the Australian: dollar in relation to the parities of our major trading partners as a whole has experienced an overall effective depreciation of approximately 1.5 per cent. In relation to the latest market rates, the effective depreciation is approximately 2 per cent. It is impossible to make any valid estimates of the effects of the Government's decision on the rate of capital inflow. </para>

        <para>In accordance with the Government's wishes the purpose of the Treasury Economic Paper Overseas Investment in Australia' was not to put forward policy proposals arising from the high rates of capital inflow over the past IS months but to analyse, from the Australian viewpoint, the principal economic issues raised by overseas investment in this country. At the time I tabled the document in the House on 16th May of this year I stated that my colleagues and I would be addressing ourselves to the policy issues which are identified in the Treasury Economic Paper.

        <para>Chad - (Uses a system similar to that employed in Bolivia). </para>
        <para>Denmark - (Uses the party list system combined with the uninominal ballot. Electors can choose between voting for a party list, either as presented or in their own order of preference, and voting for individual candidates. 135 deputies are elected by a variant of the d'Hondt method. The remaining 30 seats are supplementary seats, distributed amongst the parties). </para>
        <para>Federal Republic of Germany - (Each elector has two votes: he votes once for the candidate of his choice to elect by a simple majority system, one  deputy  for his constituency (of which there are 248). The other 248 members of the Bundestag are elected from 11 federal states by a system of proportional representation using party lists). </para>
        <para>Finland - (Uses party list system in fourteen constituencies. The fifteenth, uses a simple plurality system to elect its one deputy). </para>
        <para>Greece - (A system of simple proportional representation was used for the last elections. However, the 1968 Constitution provides for the election of a portion not less than one-sixth and not more than one-fifth, of the total number of deputies, on the basis of the proportional electoral strength of each party, using a party list system. The manner of election of the remaining deputies is not specified). </para>
        <para>Guatemala - (Uses the simple majority system in constituencies in which there is only one seat to be filled. When two or more seats are to be filled proportional representation based on party list system is used). </para>
        <para>Indonesia- (In the last election (July 1971) 100 of the 460 members of the DPR (Parliament) were to be appointed by the Armed Forces, the remainder to be elected by proportional representation on the party list system). </para>
        <para>Japan - (The system used for House of Representatives elections is basically one of the majority type. However, an element of proportionality is introduced to the system by the fact that the number of votes required for election must be equivalent to at least  a  quarter of the total valid ballots cast divided by the total number of seats to be filled in the constituency. The same system applies to elections for 150 of the 250 members of the House of Councillors, except that the relevant proportion is a sixth, instead of  a  quarter. The remaining 100 councillors are elected by the whole electorate acting as  a  single constituency, by a similar system, the proportion of the electoral quotient necessary for electors being in this case one-eighth). </para>
        <para>Mexico  -  (178 representatives of the Lower House are elected by single uninominal majority vote. The remaining 32 seals are then divided, proportionally to the votes collected for the whole of the country among the political parties which have registered as such for one year and which have now at least twenty seats). </para>
        <para>Portugal - (Uses a system similar to that which obtains in Bolivia). </para>
        <para>Switzerland - (For the election of the National Council - In the one canton and three semicantons which have  a  single seat each, elections are held on a uninominal single majority basis. The remaining twenty-two cantons employ a quite complicated form of the proportional party-list system). </para>

Nevertheless, as a matter of practice my Department satisfies itself that officers posted overseas with a representational role have a sufficient Australian connexion to enable them to carry out that role effectively. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3) and (4) Previous enquiries made of Vietnamese authorities, social welfare workers, maternity hospitals, orphanages and similar institutions have consistently revealed that it is impossible to establish the paternal origin of the part-Caucasian, illegitimate children in Vietnam. I am, therefore, unable to either refute or confirm the unsubstantiated charges referred to by the honourable member. </para>

                <para>Nine of the movements were correctly scheduled at or shortly before 11 p.m. No special approval is required for such flights since the curfew is designed to prevent the regular scheduling of jet aircraft between the horn's of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Published schedules relate to times of departure from the passenger terminal and it is accepted that some time must elapse before the aircraft is ready for take-off from the duty runway. </para>

A flight that was scheduled for departure at 10.20 p.m., taxied at 11.10 p.m. and took off at 11.21 p.m. Approval to operate a flight delayed until after 11 p.m. must be obtained from the Regional Director, Department of Civil Aviation, New South Wales Region.

            <para>Ground running of aircraft engines for test purposes and maintenance is an essential part of aircraft operations and is directly related to safety, requirements.

            <para>Strict control is applied to ensure that running engines on the ground at the airport for maintenance purposes causes a minimum of inconvenience to nearby residents. The procedures cover a number of pages of instructions to operators but the primary objective of these procedures is to ban the running of engines between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. except in unusual cases of need. In such cases special parking areas are set aside taking into consideration the wind conditions which would be likely to 'blow' the noise in  a  particular direction away from residences. From 5 a.m. until 7 a.m. engine running is further restricted to those aircraft required for early morning departures. </para>

            <para>The regulations governing the ground running of aircraft engines are regularly reviewed by the Department of Civil Aviation. Although the number of ground running complaints is not high there is a possibility that some necessary, but routine ground running might be conducted while the aircraft concerned is on the ground at a location other than Sydney. This possibility is under investigation and may result in a reduction in the frequency of ground runs that take place at Sydney. </para>

As to non-government secondary, schools which receive grants for building, the Minister is supplied by the architect concerned, after construction is complete, with a report that the project has been completed to the standard shown on the approved sketch plans. The costs relating to the project its given by the architect must be supported by the auditor's certification, to which I have referred.

          <para>To date no Papuan or New Guinean has been included in a Trade Commissioner training course conducted by my Department. </para>
          <para>The training of Papuans and New Guineans in international trade matters depends on the availability of university graduates as there are no suitable indigenes available with business backgrounds. Three indigenous trade trainees have been recruited to date for full-time university study. One of these has now graduated. To further his experience, he has attended meetings of ECAFE and UNCTAD as an observer, and will possibly attend a trade promotion course in Geneva later this year. He will subsequently be considered for inclusion in a future Trade Commissioner course. The second student is currently completing the final year of his university studies, and the third student is due to graduate at the end of 1973. These 2 students will similarly be considered for inclusion in Trade Commissioner courses in the light of their suitability following graduation. </para>

Furthermore, the requirements for supersonic flight also require proportionately greater installed thrust than in the subsonic aircraft. The need to provide high thrust in small frontal area leads to the use of reheat for take-off, and transonic acceleration, and to relatively high jet efflux velocities, and makes large diameter high by-pass ratio turbofan engines quite inappropriate at this time. The prospects, therefore of substantial reduction in the Concorde's noise levels by using high by-pass ration turbofan engines instead  of  the existing pure turbojet engines is indeed remote. </para>

            <para>The authority granted to the concessionaire specifically requires that prices for liquor and other goods sold shall not exceed those charged for similar commodities in like premises in the city of Canberra. Airport prices arc subject to periodic Departmental checks but, in view of your question, a further special check will be made. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(4)">
            <para>Previous checks have not shown the prices to be excessive. Labour costs are high at airport concessions because the operator is required to service the needs of the air -travelling public which at times can mean long hours. Nevertheless prices are required to be fair as stated in my previous reply. Prices are not related to the rents paid to the Commonwealth. Tenderers calculate their own total rents and these are formed in the knowledge of the contract requirements of the Department which are set out in the lender schedule. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(5)">
            <para>and (6) The area of the Backbenchers Bar is approximately 700 square feet. This is about half the complete concession area for which the total monthly rent is $200 a month. In addition, the concessionaire tendered to pay a percentage of gross sales for his authority to trade under the Airports (Business Concessions) Act. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(7)">
            <para>This information is not held by the Department. In any case, trading circumstances are different at airports where most of the business is generated by the airlines and the Commonwealth which provides the airport facilities. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(8)">
            <para>The Department is not aware that high prices are being charged. As stated previously, this will be investigated and corrective action taken if necessary. High rents should not cause high airport prices. Price levels are set in the tender schedules prior to tenderers deciding the amount they will bid. There is no compulsion on anyone to tender and, of course, there is no compulsion on anyone to drink in the airport cocktail lounge. In accordance with the public tendering system, concession contracts are normally granted to the highest suitable tenderer but the latter must contract to comply with the Departmental terms specified in the tender schedule before being granted the concession rights. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Aboriginal stockmen have walked off Humbert River Station and Victoria River Downs Station in the Northern Territory. The reasons are complex but some of the Aborigines concerned have complained of lack of housing and disagreements on wages paid to them. The latter appears to be mainly over credit arrangements with the stores operated by pastoral owners. </para>

                <para>The reserve price of a residential lease is determined:  by calculating the average contract price and acquisition costs incurred in making land available for lease in the most recently, developed suburbs.  the average cost is divided by the total number of revenue producing acres in the area concerned to obtain an average cost per revenue producing acre. e the cost per acre is divided by the average rating value per acre. This produces a factor, o the rating value of each individual residential lease is then multiplied by the factor to give a reserve price. The resultant reserve price therefore takes account of differences in quality of land. It provides a range of prices for residential leases while still ensuring that the overall cost of land development is returned to the Commonwealth. </para>
