        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the Home of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the &#39;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#39;, Article 25 reads: &#39;Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond bis control.&#39; </para>
        <para>Yet, 23 years later, in our country of great national wealth and abundance it is to the nation&#39;s shame that many thousands of our people live in a state of being inconsistent with the dignity and worth of the human person - languishing in poverty and want, neglect and the lack of proper care necessary for their health and well-being. </para>
        <para>We, the undersigned, respectfully draw to your attention that the conscience of the nation is not at ease while the records of our country show that social services are not comparable with that of other advanced countries administering such services, therefore, we call upon the Commonwealth Government to immediately legislate for: </para>
        <para>Base pension rate - 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, all states, plus supplementary assistance and allowances based on a percentage of such earnings. Unemployed benefits equal to the foregoing. </para>
        <para>Completely free health services to cover all needs of social service pensioners - hospitalisation, chronic and long-term illness, fractures, anaesthetics, specialist, pharmaceutical, hearing aids, dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropody, surgical aids and any other applicances. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth Government to promote a comprehensive national scheme in cooperation with the States and make finance available to provide for the building of public hospitals, nursing and hostel-type homes necessary to effectively meet the special requirements of aged people, in conjunction with a comprehensive domiciliary care programme to enable aged people to stay in their homes. </para>
        <para>Mental illness placed in the same position as physical illness. </para>

            <para>- I have had quite a number of deputations on this subject, some from members of the Opposition. We deplore the fact that there is a division in the church but there is little that the Australian Government can do about this in Australia. One of the consequences of this division is that although the Greek Government recognises marriages performed only by that section of the church which it recognises as the established church, in Australia we recognise marriages performed by both sections when the celebrants are registered under our Marriage Act. It is true that when persons whose marriages were not performed by the section of the church recognised by the Greek Government return to Greece they find that their marriages are not recognised. The way in which the Greek Government administers its own law is. of course, an internal and domestic matter for that Government. On the other hand, following upon deputations to me I have taken steps to consult our ambasador in Athens for further advice on this matter. 1 will be considering what arises out of that consultation. At present no definitive action is proposed. </para>

            <para>- Lending by banks, in particular savings banks, for housing is at a record level, both for the last financial year and for this calendar year. The total lending for housing is well in excess of $550m a year. The Government hopes that this trend will continue for the simple reason that bank lending has always been a very traditional and important source of lending to those people who require homes of their own. It is part of the Government&#39;s policy that the nature of the traditional banking system be retained. The Government has therefore felt some trepidation over a proposal which would force the Commonwealth Bank to lend money for housing at rates of a little over 3 per cent. This proposal would, if adopted, have 2 clear and very obvious repercussions immediately. It would immediately debar more than 11,000 young couples each year from obtaining their loans for housing from the Commonwealth Bank. Those people who have traditionally obtained their funds from this source would be debarred. The second result would be far more serious. The proposal would result in the immediate destruction of all the non-Commonwealth Savings Banks systems of making loans for housing and it would be a much more effective method of destroying the banking system than was ever contemplated under the proposal to nationalise banking. Let me say finally that this proposal is part of the banking proposals of the Australian Labor Party insofar as they relate to housing, and these are contained in section 9 and section 12 of that Party&#39;s platform. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of any decision by the Australian Dairy Produce Board along the lines suggested by the honourable member. I am aware that Asian dairy factories have been a worthwhile effort at diversification by the Australian dairy industry at a time when the dairy industry realistically appreciated that its continued opportunity for sales in the United Kingdom was likely to be impaired and that it was necessary to find new and diversified outlets for dairy products. It is true that in the past 18 months because of a quite remarkable increase in the price of butter in particular but also in the price of dried milk, powdered milk, skim milk and all other processed and manufactured milk products overseas, the general circumstances of the sale of milk products have changed radically. However, it would still be futile for the dairy industry to think that these traditional markets on which it built up its exports and on which it has relied will always be available. Indeed, we are on notice that as from 1st January 1973 the British market will be substantially affected and this will apply particularly to dairy products exported from Australia. The Asian dairy industries represent a worthwhile effort by the Australian dairy industry to gain new outlets for its products and I should be loath to intervene with the Dairy Board&#39;s worthwhile efforts in this regard. Nevertheless, I shall refer the honourable gentleman&#39;s question to the Board which, I have no doubt, will take into account the comments he has made. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for National Development relating to the Woodside-Burmah consortium as to the north west shelf exploration programme. In view of the Government&#39;s refusal to permit Parliament to pass effective laws to control territorial waters and the continental shelf, I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that, in recent arrangements reached relating to the 4 farm-out areas totalling some 21,000 square miles, of the 10 companies involved 9 are completely oversea controlled? Is it a fact that if commercial discoveries are made in these areas the effective Australian share in the total production will decline below the existing 25 per cent Australian equity in the consortium? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will withhold ratification of these farm-out agreements to ensure maximum Australian participation and control over these irreplaceable and valuable natural gas deposits, valued at $16,500,000,000? </para>

            <para>- I am pleased that the honourable member is showing some interest in this important matter which in the future will become even more important to our national economy. I should like to correct him at the outset in relation to one thing. The honourable member referred to matters concerning jurisdiction in a particular region. Perhaps he has overlooked the fact that this is covered by joint legislation enacted by this Parliament and the Parliament of Western Australia. The Western Australian Government issues permits for this sort of exploration and, as the honourable member would know, Western Australia has a Labor government. Of course, permits were issued in relation to the north west shelf by the previous government in Western Australia. Once a permit has been issued by the Western Australian Government the issue of the permit must be confirmed by the Commonwealth Department of National Development. The initial appoach for a permit is made to the Western Australian Government. In fact, the Designated Authority under the 2 Acts is the Minister in the Government of Western Australia. I think that that point should be clarified at this stage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second point relates to overseas investment. This does not directly come under my control but I think the honourable member will be pleased to learn that today the Treasurer will make a statement, and a White Paper in relation to this matter will be put down in this House so that all aspects of this matter may be open to study by all honourable members. In addition to that, there are the guidelines introduced by the former Prime Minister. </para>
          <para class="block">These guidelines are being adhered to substantially by the Government. One of the prime responsibilities in relation to this matter rests with the Government of Western Australia. But I can assure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that the various matters which the honourable member has raised are very much in our mind, and certainly the aspects affecting the national well-being will be very carefully considered when future approaches are made for a farm-out arrangement. </para>
          <para>The final point I make relates to the quoting of figures in relation to the gas, or perhaps oil deposits or condensate, that is on the north west shelf. At the present time I will not accept any figures until they are proven. We hope that it will be a very substantial field indeed, and the indications are that the suggested figures reflect the direction which the proven figures may ultimately take. At the present time 1 will not accept the figures that the honourable member has quoted, but we hope that the results ultimately will show a very substantial field which will be to the benefit of Australia as a whole. </para>

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to recent articles in various Australian newspapers stating that the British Foreign Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec</inline> Douglas-Home, has written a letter to a Labor backbencher, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leslie</inline> Huckfield. claiming that he has not received any representations from Canberra concerning the protection of Australia&#39;s interests during the transitional period of Britain&#39;s entry to the European Economic Community? Is the Minister aware that the way some of these articles are written suggests either that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec</inline> Douglas-Home was not aware of the criticism you had made of the apparent lack of British action to protect Australian interests or that you never made such criticism? Will you tell the House what actually happened? </para>

            <para>- There have been some minor newspaper reports on this matter. I just do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec</inline> DouglasHome was not aware of my criticism of the British Government about the transitional arrangements which were made for Australia, particularly in respect of those items which were under quota arrangements with the British Government. During the course of discussions whilst I was in Britain last year I had an opportunity of meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec</inline> Douglas-Home to talk about this matter, but the facts of this matter are that I stated my point very clearly also in a statement to this House. I said that we were disappointed with the result. The British Government replied that it now had a safeguard clause which could be introduced if there was disruption to certain agricultural commodities going to the European Economic Community. We have not received clarification of what this really means. I hope to get into discussions with the British Government, and I hope that it is in a position to amplify the safeguard clause more when I have these discussions. However the British Government faces the difficulty of having this safeguard clause defined more fully by the European members. So we are going through a period of trying to negotiate and confer so that we know where we will stand during the 5-year period. I do not think that any accusations that I have not been unequivocal or forthright in my comments about the British negotiations would hold water. In fact a lot of people felt that I went a little too far last year. </para>

Should the takeover be successful will it not result in sufficient overseas ownership in the new corporation to be able to control it effectively? Will it not also result in the avoidance of the present competition between the 2 pipe making industries concerned?

            <para>- I have read a newspaper report which states that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> McLeod of the Association for International Co-operation and Disarmament has received an invitation from North Vietnam to visit that country. It is perhaps not unexpected, seeing that the honourable member for Lalor has invited representatives from Hanoi to attend one of his demonstrations. In addition, of course, one sees the attitude to this war which was revealed in the bitter attack on America and American action contained in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition last Tuesday evening. This attack on behalf of the Australian Labor Party on the actions of the United States and that country&#39;s attempt to defend its ally against this blatant invasion, might well suggest to the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Government of North Vietnam that it would have considerable support in Australia for its actions and might well lead <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> McLeod to think that he too would have the support of the Australian Labor Party if he was able to make a visit in order to give that country aid and comfort. </para>
          <para>There was one part of the question, I think, which referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeod</inline> perhaps endeavouring to persuade North Vietnam to desist from its invasion. Although I speak only from recollection from the time when 1 was Attorney-General, I should perhaps warn <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeod</inline> that there was then a law in force in North Vietnam that propagandising in concert against the policy of the Government is punishable by death. Therefore, perhaps he ought to be careful in adopting any attitude while in North Vietnam in which he would be critical of the actions of that Government. </para>
          <para>Finally, may I say at a more serious level that I think most Australian people believe that this is a blatant invasion from the north against which the South Vietnamese are defending themselves very courageously. There are still some Australians in that country. Again, I think that the majority of Australians would regard this proposed visit as disgraceful. </para>

In view of the decision to allow a Russian deserter to obtain political asylum in Australia, has the Minister considered the position of a number of Greek seamen on whose behalf a number of honourable members have made representations? Is he aware that these seamen are being or may have been deported back to Greece to what I, would think is an equally repressive regime? Will his Department consider whether these seamen also should be given the benefit of political as\&#39;Iii m ?

            <para>- Single personnel at the future facility on Garden Island will bc accommodated to a large degree on the island itself. At present investigations regarding married quarters are proceeding with the State housing authorities and others. There are several possibilities in regard to married quarters. The town of Kwinana, which is some 8 miles inland from Rockingham, and Safety Bay arc other suggestions which have been made as to the location of housing for personnel. I believe that during this week the authorities will be getting together to discuss this topic and I hope that a decision will be made very shortly. As to the public use of Garden Island, when the Prime Minister was in Western Australia recently he indicated that the Navy will not currently require the entire area of the island, which has traditionally been used as a place of recreation. It is anticipated that approximately 10 miles of the beach line of the island will be available for public use and something like- </para>

              <para>- I will rephrase slightly what I have said to convey the same message. The Navy will not require the entire area of the island for some considerable time anyway, and could make available for recreation purposes some 10 miles of beach and 1,800 acres of hinterland. There is, of course, the additional problem of holiday homes that have been there for quite some time. Representations have been made to retain the right to this usage of the island. The Navy&#39;s intention would be, in principle, to make as much of this land as is not immediately required for defence purposes, available for the wider use of the community on a daily visitation basis. The Government will look forward with interest to the findings of the Public Works Committee. When those findings are known I do not think the Navy will be found to bs in any way more demanding than I have just described. </para>

As I replied in an answer to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition only last week, the Government is examining a number of courses of action embracing the whole of the aircraft industry and also has before it for consideration a number of proposals regarding the work load in this industry. There is no question of a deadline or cutoff or any sudden changes taking place. Until the matter is clarified there is no more that I can add at this stage. </para>

            <para>-The criticism from some quarters following the announcement by the Prime Minister of weighted Government support for education in favour of independent schools is not justified or accurate. Of the total capital funds that the Prime Minister announced of $2 15m, $167m will be going to Government schools and $48 m to independent schools and that division of the total sum is pretty much the same as the division of enrolments in government schools and independent schools. It is nonsense, therefore, to say that the grant is weighted in favour of independent schools. In addition honourable members should have noted that government schools in the States have access to the very substantial loan funds which the Commonwealth often supports and underwrites while for independent schools, apart from the science laboratories and libraries programmes, the provisions announced last week by the Prime Minister represent basically the only support they will have. I would find it hard to see how a policy under which 40 per cent of the cost of education in government schools is paid in respect of children in independent schools could be regarded as weighting payments in favour of independent schools. It is a payment equal to 40 per cent of the equivalent cost in government schools. I believe that kind of charge could come only from those who basically do not support independent schools as well as government schools. It could come only from those who would seek to establish one education system throughout Australia. </para>

Would the Minister explain why the normal procedure was not adopted regarding a ship&#39;s deserter from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?

Normally a resident of my electorate, he was the victim of mistaken identity and was sent from kennels in Sydney to England where he is temporarily accommodated, appropriately, in Berkshire. The Minister for Health in another place has indicated that he may, after a month at sea on the return voyage, have to spend another 2 months in quarantine. Is it not possible in a shorter time to determine whether he is suffering from foot rot, Newcastle disease or perhaps even rabies? I ask the Minister to confer with his colleague to see whether they can do better for this much loved, sad and lonely creature? </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General a question. The honourable and learned gentleman will not think me impatient if I ask him about the proposal for the Commonwealth Superior Court which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick was authorised by Cabinet to design in December 1962, on which he himself in his first period as Attorney-General made a ministerial statement in May 1967, and for which he introduced a Bill in November 1968. When I asked him about it during his own second period as Attorney-General he said that it was under consideration by the Department but not yet by the Government - due, he thought, to the change in the Ministry. I now ask him whether the McMahon Ministry has considered the proposal and, if so, with what result, ls this 10-year-old proposal likely to be introduced during the lifetime of this Parliament? </para>

            <para>- 1 can understand the honourable gentleman&#39;s desire to protect the Government of South Australia. The South Australian Minister for Education has objected to these capital proposals beginning to operate from July 1973 and in doing that, of course, he has ignored entirely the present capital funds which go only to government schools, which he will have for spending up until June 1973. The proposals announced by the Prime Minister are designed to take over from the interim measure announced by the Prime Minister before Christmas. One of the principal reasons for doing this was to give State departments the opportunity to plan ahead, to gear up for a greater rate of expenditure on school buildings in primary and secondary schools. So often when funds have been made available - and this includes South Australia as much as any State, if not more than most other States - they have not been spent in the time scale in which the Commonwealth was prepared to provide them, because the States have not been able to plan ahead, and this applied to South Australia. The States previously claimed that they did not have enough forward notice to gear up for the additional expenditure. We have now given them that additional notice and there cannot be that excuse for not committing them in the way in which they are designed to be used. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The criticism from South Australia rings particularly hollow because at the recent Premiers Conference additional funds were made available to all the States which they were entitled to spend for works and housing programmes. The 3 eastern States particularly - Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - and Tasmania under its former government made large parts of those additional funds available for increased school construction. The Labor States of South Australia and Western Australia made virtually no additional funds available for school construction from the funds granted at the Premiers Conference. It would have been within their own prerogative to do so if the State Education Ministers had been able to persuade their own governments that the matters were of sufficient priority. </para>

            <para>- I call to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science the fact that the grants being paid to private schools include per capita grants by State governments also, according to his scheme. Is it a fact that under this scheme, allowing for an increase in the number of pupils attending independent schools and an increase in the costs, over the next 5 years, the extra amount that will be paid out to private schools will be $250m? This amount will be paid out by the Commonwealth and State governments in capital grants and in increased per capita grants. Is it a fact that if the State governments play their part, as requested by the Prime Minister, they will not have the $l67m in capital grants but rather a net increase of only $42m? Do these figures, therefore, show that the private schools over the next 5 years will get an extra $372 a head while government schools will, in fact, get an extra $17.50 a head? How does the Minister explain this inequality between the 2 systems? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman has an infinite capacity to mix up figures and in this sense he has mixed up capital and recurrent payments. The additional funds that the Government is making available to government and independent schools for capital purposes will stand as sums additional to what the States otherwise might have been expected to spend. The Prime Minister has made it plain that the Government&#39;s purpose is that this should be a net addition to government school construction. It will be an addition of $167m. The grant of $48m also will be additional for school construction - a new programme of support for independent schools. This, for the Commonwealth purposes, is roughly on a per capita basis between government and independent schools. But for recurrent funds, for the life of me, 1 find it difficult to understand how the honourable gentleman can object to a proposal which would seek to give independent schools some degree of certainty in future planning for their recurrent expenditure. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On that basis what the Prime Minister has proposed would make available to independent schools 40 per cent of the cost of education in a government primary school or 40 per cent of the cost of education in a government secondary school. It is quite plain that the honourable member for Bendigo finds objection to that particular proposal. I can believe that people would have objection to it only if they felt that governments have not an obligation to all school children - those who have an education in government schools and also those who are educated in independent schools. The Government believes it has a responsibility to all Australian school schildren and for the first time in Australia&#39;s history the Prime Minister has taken steps that will give effect to that belief in a realistic and fair manner. </para>

            <para>- I refer to last Friday&#39;s issue of the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; which contained a vicious personal attack on me by a journalist who calls himself Maximilian Walsh. This attack was based on this man&#39;s inside story, so called, of events which occurred at Labor&#39;s parliamentary executive and caucus meetings last Wednesday in relation to the Softwood Forestry Agreements Bill. The article condemned and rubbished me on the grounds that because a recommendation I made to the executive was not successful I took my fight into a caucus in order to achieve my view and I was defeated, which in fact means that I defied the executive. This is a lie. He stated that I lined up the environmentalists against the development fundamentalists. This is utterly untrue. He then said that when the question was put the Patterson forces - presumably that includes me - were routed. This is utterly untrue. </para>

When I challenged him last Friday afternoon as to the source of these lies, he informed me that his story simply repeated details which had been given to him about what happened in the executive and the caucus, and he had no reason to doubt the correctness of the information given to him.

            <para>- by  leave - Over the past 18 months or so Australia has experienced an extraordinarily high rate of capital inflow. This development has attracted considerable interest, and indeed concern, in the community. In December of last year the Government requested the Treasury to put in band a detailed study of the matter. I now inform the House that this task has been completed and I lay on the table for consideration by the House the following paper: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Commonwealth Treasury Economic Paper No. 1, </para>
            <para>Overseas Investment in Australia. May 1972. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and I have previously indicated, this Treasury study should provide an appropriate vehicle for debate of the general question of overseas investment in Australia. Its purpose is to analyse, from the Australian viewpoint, the principal economic issues raised by overseas investment in this country. </para>
          <para>These issues are essentially concerned with the growth and development of the domestic economy - for example, the allocation of available resources, the distribution of income, the degree of competition and other domestic economic management questions of that kind. Naturally, the inflow of foreign capital also has implications : or the balance of payments, but so long as the economy is reasonably well managed these will be less significant. </para>
          <para>The terms of reference of the paper must be emphasised. It does not attempt to assess the non-economic aspects of overseas investment. Moreover, although it inevitably ranges over matters having a bearing on general policy in this field, it does not put forward policy proposals. The paper encompasses many statistics and facts as well as detailed economic argument, and honourable members will wish to give it close consideration and have time to digest it. It would not therefore be appropriate for me now to launch a general debate on the subject. I would however like to outline briefly the main themes which the paper raises. First however it is necessary to understand the international financial background against which the recent high level of capital inflow has occurred. The gradual breakdown of the international monetary system throughout the past decade culminated on 15th August last in the formal termination of convertibility of the United States dollar. Up to that time we had seen a mounting volume of international liquidity as United States dollars flowed outwards to the world as a result of the continuing deficit in the balance of payments of that country. </para>
          <para>Because of these and other associated developments - notably the growth of the Euro-currency markets - many countries have seen large inflows of capital over recent years. Such inflows have taken many forms: direct investment in new industry; takeovers of existing enterprises; portfolio investment in equity shares or other existing financial assets; loans to business enterprises or individuals; and last, but by no means least, speculative movements of capital in one or other of these ways but with an eye chiefly to the possibility of exchange rate changes. </para>
          <para>These developments are important, for 2 reasons: First, they have undoubtedly affected both the attitudes and the expectations which are nowadays brought to any appraisal of the costs and benefits of foreign investment. Secondly, and as part of that, the addition of a major new source of international capital obviously has some implications for any assessment of the &#39;scarcity value&#39; of such capital. Capital inflow, in whatever form, provides the host country with claims on overseas resources. But these claims can only be made effective if they are actually used in the acquisition of such resources from abroad, currently or in the future. To do so, the current account deficit of the balance of payments must be increased. Pending that, these claims will take the form solely of additions to the country&#39;s international reserves. As the Treasury paper says, this point is quite basic. If by means of capital inflow a country is to add to the real resources available to it for accelerating its development, it can do so only by incurring a deficit on the current account. Australia has for some time now sustained a sizeable level of capital inflow. Equally, it has sustained a current account balance of payments deficit which, taking one year with another, has been roughly similar in size. The inflow of capital to Australia has therefore been reflected in broadly equivalent additions of real resources to the economy. </para>
          <para>More recently, this has greatly changed. On the one hand, capital inflow has risen considerably. On the other hand, the current account balance of payments deficit, so far from rising in line with that, has actually diminished appreciably, although this has been due partly to cyclical factors. In short, during the past 2 years or so the acceleration in capital inflow has not been matched by any similar rise in drawings on real resources from abroad. Instead, it has been matched by a rapid and continuing build-up in our international reserves. The recent growth in capital inflow largely reflects an increase in borrowings from abroad. This in turn stems from a conjuncture of circumstances. On the one hand, during the greater part of this period monetary policy within Australia has been &#39;out of phase&#39; in varying degree with monetary conditions abroad. There have been good reasons, of a domestic economic management kind, for that. On the other hand, financial developments in Australia, particularly the establishment and growing activities of the merchant banks, have led to much greater interest in borrowing possibilities abroad. The particular timing of events has meant that these developments have not, over the period in question, represented a significant impediment to policy. None the less, there are potential dilemmas inherent in the situation. Essentially they concern the degree to which a government&#39;s domestic monetary management can be influenced, or even determined, by external factors. </para>
          <para>The degree of actual dilemma will vary over time. There will be situations when the effects of capital inflow will be fully consistent with the stance of monetary policy. There will be situations when the internal and external forces at work are finely balanced and when any conflict between the 2 will therefore be manageable. There will, however, be other situations in which capital movements will run directly counter to the stance of domestic monetary policy and may even necessitate its abandonment. It is these latter &#39;conflict situations&#39; that raise the dilemma in its sharpest form. This is the first of the major economic questions which capital inflow poses for Australia today. It is, in essence, the problem of reconciling capital inflow with sensible and balanced management of the domestic economy. A second economic problem can arise from capital inflow for a country whose exchange rate is reckoned, rightly or wrongly, to be undervalued. In such circumstances funds will move into the country, motivated to a greater or less degree by hopes of profiting from exchange rate appreciation. Before long it will be being said that because the country is receiving large quantities of foreign capital and its reserves are consequently rising, it necessarily must follow that its exchange rate is undervalued. That is an over-simple view. True, problems associated with disruptive capital flows will be exacerbated if a country&#39;s exchange rate does not reflect its fundamental external position. But it is equally clear that an appropriate exchange rate will not remove, though it will reduce, the potential for conflict situations to arise. </para>
          <para>The third possible problem arising out of capital inflow is that of foreign ownership and control. In Australia, the proportionate foreign ownership of Australian companies has risen from around 20 per cent in 1948-49 to, probably, around 35 per cent in 1970-71. From a purely economic viewpoint, and always assuming that the general management of the economy remains, over the years, reasonably sound, such a rise in the ownership ratio need not pose any threat. For one thing, foreignowned companies are subject to the laws of the host country. Unlike the case of Canada, foreign control in Australia has not rested predominantly with a single country. Moreover, the foreign owner&#39;s aspirations for his enterprise may coincide in important ways with the national economic interest. Even so, a high and rising degree of foreign control could conflict with national aspirations. One suggested solution to the foreign control question is insistence upon an increased, or a certain minimum level of, local equity participation in enterprises undertaken by foreign interests. However, while increased local equity may constrain the growth of overseas ownership, it may have little impact on overseas control. Whatever the other benefits of increased local equity may be, it is also fair to say that, for reasons which are set out in the Treasury paper, in the process of increasing local equity some of the benefits of overseas investment may be reduced. A particular form of the problem of ownership and control arises in the case of foreign takeovers. This is a complex question and I do not propose at this stage to offer any quick answers to the problems that it poses. One such problem of great importance is whether the takeover will result in the restriction of competition. That, of course, is an aspect common to all takeovers, whether initiated domestically or from abroad. </para>
          <para>The problem of ownership and control is one principally related to the field of direct investment - and. in the matter of ownership, equity portfolio investment. This fact leads to certain other conclusions. Action of any general kind to restrain or reduce the growth of foreign ownership and control will carry implications in a number of fields - introduction of technical know-how, for example - which stem from the nature of direct investment. By the same token, such action is unlikely to have more than a modest bearing on the 2 other problems referred to earlier - domestic economic management and exchange rate speculation, should that exist. Equally, action to reduce the potential for domestic economic management conflict situations to arise might not, depending on its precise nature, have any effects upon foreign ownership and control. The truth is - and these illustrations underline it - that even in a strictly economic calculus, the subject of foreign investment does not readily lend itself to easy generalisations. </para>
          <para>I recognise, of course, that the subject cannot be confined within an economic calculus. It is proper that a Treasury paper on it should be largely so confined. But the question of overseas investment engenders a great body of argument of a non-economic kind. The balance of economic benefits and costs must therefore be weighed against the balance of non-economic benefits and costs. Each can change over time, as can the weighting between them. In the economic field, for example, consider the contention that a net inflow of capital from abroad will usually enable one&#39;s economy to grow faster, and one&#39;s living standards to increase more rapidly, than they would otherwise. This contention is, I believe, broadly speaking valid. Yet its force clearly diminishes, at the margin, the larger one&#39;s economy and the higher one&#39;s living standards become. There may be other reasons for changes over time in the weighting to be given to economic and non-economic aspects of this matter. Changing values within a society, by virtue of the changes they may imply for the society&#39;s broad objectives, can also play a part. Increasingly today it is being argued that a society achieving a high rate of economic growth as measured by the gross national product statistics is not necessarily a happier or even a materially richer society than one in which those statistics are rising less fast. Increasingly, emphasis is being laid on the social and other aspects of economic change and growth. To the extent that values change in these ways, so too does the basis for assessment of foreign investment also change in some degree. </para>
          <para>Let me now turn to the issues for future consideration. There is no doubt in my own mind that the attitude of Australians towards the unrestricted inflow of foreign capital has, over the years, been undergoing some change. There is nothing surprising, or necessarily objectionable, about that. I have myself indicated on several previous occasions that, however tenable it may have been 10 years ago, what I call the &#39;startled fawn&#39; approach to foreign capital is no longer appropriate. More and more, too, non-economic considerations of the kind I have mentioned earlier are coming to the fore, and the balance of the discussion is changing as a consequence. It is one thing to recognise these developments. It is another to prescribe for them. </para>
          <para>In my remarks today I have sought only to identify the problems at this stage. They are: Firstly, the present level of inflow and the potential problem that creates for managing the domestic economy, as well as the financial costs to Australia which are involved; secondly, the suggestions of exchange rate speculation to which such inflows can give rise, and the possible consequences of that; and thirdly, the sheer fact of foreign ownership and control of important aspects of our economy. I have no intention today of addressing myself to what, if any, actions might be appropriate to deal with these problems, or with some of them. Whether we should seek to do so. and if so in what way, are matters for calm deliberation. Questions of this importance are not to be settled &#39;off the cuff&#39;. We have identified the policy issues. Over the period ahead my colleagues and I will be addressing ourselves to them. If decisions are to be taken, they should be taken after careful and informed discussion and in the light of the public debate which I hope this Treasury Economic Paper will now assist in generating. </para>

            <para>- Firstly I thank the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> for having sent me a copy of this magnum opus on Sunday evening. I must confess that since that time I have read nothing else. I say without offence that I found it to be a valuable handbook for students of economic affairs but not much of a guide for legislators, present or future. I would have thought that most of the information it contains would have been readily available to the Department of the Treasury already and therefore also to the Treasurer. One thing that does seem clear from the text - one would need to read it several times - is the need in Australia for something that the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review pointed to many years ago. That is the need in Australia to have an integrated economic policy. Reading between the lines it is evident that that is what Australia does not have at the moment. The other thing that is surprising is how deficient we still are in what should be regarded as fundamental information. Let me take as an example of that, chapter 4 on page 70 of the document entitled Overseas Investment in Australia&#39;, which reads as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Surveys conducted by the Commonwealth Statistician indicate that direct ownership and control <inline font-style="italic">al</inline> around one-quarter of Australian manufacturing industry rested overseas in 1966-67 while approximately one-half of the value of mining (excluding oil) production in 1968 was accounted for by overseas-owned and controlled establishments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On page 5 of the document, Table I - Overseas Investment in Companies in Australia, by Form of Investment, 1947-48 to 1970-71 - shows quite clearly, as regards, both direct investment, in the form of undistributed income and all other investment, and portfolio investment and institutional loans, the significance of the increase in the aggregate over the years from 1966-67 to 1970-71. In those 5 years the undistributed income was $1,241 m out of a total of $2,75 lm, which is pretty close to half. The other income was $ 1,973m out of a total of $4.994tn. or 40 per cent. In the more significant and newer field of portfolio and institutional loans, the increase in those 5 years was Si, 796m out of a total of $2.5 19m. In aggregate in 1970-71 we had double the overseas interest in Australian companies that we had in 1966-67. </para>
          <para>It seems to me to be astonishing that in a situation where we ought to be beginning to map what has actually occurred, no later statistics of much relevance appear in this document other than those going back to 1966-67 and 1967-68. If the degree were as significant then, how much more so is it in 1971-72? I suggest that that is what a lot of this discussion should be about. </para>
          <para>The other matter to which I want to draw particular attention is a paragraph on page 110 of the document. In my view this document is in many respects a very subtle indictment of the conduct of the economy by this Government over the past 2 years in particular. The fourth paragraph on that page reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Developments over the last 2 years- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Presumably this is going back to 1 970 -  certainly indicate that, at least under some condition?, private capital flows have now  acquired  d a practical potential to nullify the effects of monetary policy on internal economic conditions. The particular circumstances of this &#39;learning&#39; period have not been such that the flows in question have prevented domestic monetary policy achieving its major objectives. In other circumstances, this may not be the case. </para>
          <para class="block">I would submit that the paragraph is exceedingly kind about what has happened in the last 2 years, particularly bearing in mind what was pointed out in the last annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, tabled in this House as far back as August 1971. It indicated, to my mind without much doubt, that the monetary policy that rightly or wrongly - to use one of the phrases in this document - has been sought to be imposed by the sovereign government of this country had in effect been nullified by the large inflow of capital into this country and what were the practical or real effects of that action. Whereas the public works activity, particularly in building, had been stepped down, and private dwelling construction, in the name of controlling inflation, had been curtailed, one finds that as a result of private inflow what is described as building other than dwellings actually increased. </para>
          <para>If ever there was an indication that the policy of this Government - the sovereign government supposedly - was being nullified, it was evident enough as far back as 1971. I would like to draw attention to what are virtually the latest statistics in this document. It does nol contain many recent ones, apart from certain aggregates which are difficult to analyse. I suppose that the ones to which 1 propose to refer are in the same category. A table entitled Increase in the Australian Money Supply: Formation, 1968-69 to 1971-72 ($m)&#39; appears on page 106 of the paper. This table gives the picture for the first 3 quarters of 1970-71 as against the same 3 quarters for 1971-72 and presumably takes the situation up to the end of March 1972, or near enough up to date. The significant item in the table is entitled &#39;Including: net apparent private capital inflow&#39;. This item was thought to have been high in the 3 quarters of 1970-71 when it. stood at $977m, but for the same 3 quarters of this year, or for the same 9 months of this financial year, it is $ 1,341m. I suggest that other tables demand a certain amount of close analysis. 1 tried to say something about this the other evening when one of the Supply Bills was before us, but because we discussed the measure late at night no-one took very much notice of what I had to say. It seems that what this report points out, and very kindly suggests, is that we might have been able to get by in this way in the past. But I would suggest that we have now reached the stage of what might be called &#39;other circumstances&#39; when this may not be the case. Whilst I can appreciate that the paper presented was not a policy document, nevertheless its details reveal to everyone bow recreant this Government has been in the conduct of its economic policy. 1 refer particularly to what was contained in the Budget - not the Budget presented by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> who is at the table - of 12 months before. </para>
          <para>Surely this is a serious matter. It is not a matter that can be delayed for further palavers. If we have reached a stage where our overall economic development, including such questions as interest rates, exchange rates and the availability of credit, is thought to be vulnerable, can the Government delay any longer announcing some specific measures to show what it intends to do? One thing that was highlighted in the document was the sort of devices that are supposedly available, such as exchange control, taxation measures and so on, and how these devices can be frustrated - and this was particularly true in regard to the section on exchange control - by people who come here calling this a host country, but who in essence can become predators on our total economy by the way they choose to act, either in terms of the available exchange controls or the taxation laws. I suggest that apart from talking at international conferences about exchange rates and the effects that they have on developing and undeveloped countries and so on, what is necessary in the twentieth century - and we are now in the 1970s which is at the latter end of the twentieth century - is the need to consider these other matters. </para>
          <para>This document makes references in some places to the influence of what, for want of a better term, are called multi-national countries which choose to shift profits - to use the term in the document - to suit themselves, according to where their various interests might be. They adopt devices such as delaying the payment for orders in Australia if credit restrictions are framed in a certain way, changing the interest rate or allowing goods to be marked al what are presumably false prices. It is said that section 36 of the income tax legislation supposedly gives some safeguards, but it certainly does not seem to be strong enough to carry the great weight that it ought to carry. There is a great deal of emerging literature about the conduct of multi-nationals. What is required is an international code of business behaviour. If this is not introduced, what is supposed to be the blessing of international and multi-national trade could well go sour in the faces of smaller countries as against the bigger ones. 1 suggest that these problems at least are implicit here. </para>
          <para>There are not just 3 Treasury requirements in this field. The early stages of the report list 8 matters which require examination and which go to the totality of the whole economy. At least, to my mind, that is the one pleasing aspect of this report. Foreign investment cannot be considered in isolation. Foreign investment is one aspect only - a significant aspect but one aspect only - of the functioning of the total economy. Mostly what we do in this country, both by way of capital supplies and goods and services, is done by way of our own resources. We would have been a poorer country, a less diversified country and possibly a less efficient country if we had not had some of the advantages of foreign investment in the past. But. as the very need of this document suggests, we have reached the kind of state in the economy where there is a questioning as to whether it is all benefits and no kicks. It is time that we began to evaluate the benefits and the totality of the implications of this very significant matter in our economy. I hope that the report will stir the Government to greater action. </para>
          <para>I submit that there was nothing in the document that the Treasurer, who is at the table, ought not to have known. In many respects 1 think I could have written it myself. </para>

But the proposition that this document is a pointer to what we should do in the future rests, as it must rest, in the hands of the sovereign government, and if we are not careful there will not be any sovereign government, according to some of the data lines of that report. </para>

          <para>-  I rise to address myself to clause 13 of the Bill. This clause contains 14 proposed new sections and covers 12 pages of the Bill. In fact, it is the most vital clause in the Bill. All the machinery placing conciliation and arbitration in 2 separate compartments is contained in this clause. Under this clause the Government&#39;s wage freezing policy is actually implemented. The clause seeks to stop consent awards or agreements from being made without certification of the Full Bench. If we look at proposed new section 22 we see that it deals with powers with respect to conciliation to be exercised by the Conciliation Commissioners and powers in respect of arbitration to be exercised by presidential members and Arbitration Commissioners. This proposed new section has been inserted, we are assured, at the request of certain employers. It separates the principle of conciliation from the principle of arbitration. The flexibility that exists under the Act will disappear and the Act will become much more rigid as a result of this amendment. This Bill seeks to reverse what was an attempt to make conciliation the most important aim of the Act and I refer here, of course, to the 1969 amendments which laid stress on conciliation. At that point of time the Government had at long last accepted that the main objective of the Act should be to encourage conciliation with a view to amicable agreement. The system became much more flexible than it had been previously and the number of consent awards and agreements showed that it was working. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This Bill separates the processes. It breaks the line of communication. Under the existing Act an application is assigned to a commissioner or judge who proceeds to hold conferences or decides to begin a hearing. In many cases both processes are, combined. The judge or commissioner may take part in conferences if he considers this course desirable and he gets to know what are the real issues in dispute. The importance of this process lies in its flexibility. Under this amendment there will be no flexibility whatever. Once conciliation reaches a barrier that is the end of it. There is a cut off point. There is no going back to have another jump at the hurdle. It cuts off at that point and the matter goes to a commissioner or judge for arbitration. There is no further conference or thought of conciliation. </para>
        <para>I refer honourable members to proposed new section 30. I do not want to quote all of it but it deals with conciliation and points out that:   the Conciliation Commissioner shall report to the relevant Presidential Member as to the matters in dispute and the parties and the extent, if any, to which the dispute has been settled, but shall not disclose anything said or done in the conciliation proceedings concerning matters in dispute that remain unsettled. </para>
        <para class="block">What a stupid section to have in the Act. The arbitrator does not know how close the parties may have been to agreement on the points in dispute. Under the existing system he would know and could arbitrate more effectively having that knowledge. This Bill will mean that apart from the arbitrator not being able to know what has happened, the hearings will be lengthened. The aim of this amendment is clear. It is to stop the unions and employers from reaching agreement. </para>
        <para>I refer now to proposed new section 31 which corresponds with section 33 of the Act. However, the proposed new section goes much further and means that matters such as hours of work, rates of pay where related to the national economy, minimum wage, equal pay, and annual or long service leave all have to be referred to the Full Bench. This is a backward step. It means that in these matters no longer will agreements or consent awards be accepted without intervention by the Full Bench. It is a step to try to prevent direct negotiation and will reduce the effectiveness of our arbitration system as we know it. Proposed new section 32 deals with bans clauses. Under this Bill the power to include or vary bans clauses in an award will be exercisable only by a presidential member. Under section 32 of the Act a commissioner could insert or refuse to insert a bans clause in an award. This was most important. It depended entirely on the merits of the case and the matters in dispute. If the Commissioner considered that the workers were wrong be inserted a bans clause. If he considered the employers were wrong he did not insert the bans clause. The new section gives exclusive power to presidential members and extends that power to the area of registered agreements. It means that a presidential member would have to insert a bans clause in an award. It is difficult to understand why jurisdiction over bans clauses, which are objectionable to the unions, should be the sole preserve of  a  presidential member. It appears clear that the rights and wrongs of a dispute will not be investigated now. Once a stopage of work takes place the emphasis will be on penalising the unions and the bans clause will be put into awards so that penalties may be imposed. </para>
        <para>The 1969 amendment relating to the bans clause was to ensure that if a dispute occurred the merits of it were investigated before a fine was imposed. We on this side believe that the sanctions provisions should be repealed and I refer here, of course, to sections 109 and 111 which are the most offending sections in the Act. These sections have been responsible for creating more strikes than they have settled. Looking at this Bill one would think that the inflicting of penalties was an end in itself, but this ignores entirely the fact that the end is to settle industrial disputes  as  quickly as possible and not to extend them by inflicting severe penalties. What the Government is forgetting is that this is the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. &#39;Conciliation&#39; comes first in the Act and &#39;conciliation&#39; appearing before &#39;arbitration&#39; in clearly significant. In his second reading speech the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Ft the parties can reach agreement they will be able to make a memorandum of their agreement and request the Conciliation Commissioner to certify that memorandum as an award, or, alternatively, request him to make an award or order giving effect to their agreement. The Conciliation Commissioner will be required to satisfy himself that the agreement reached by the parties is in the public interest. The provision, therefore, continues a like provision to that in the existing section 31 of the Act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The existing Act provides for conciliators and commissioners but it does not say that the whole of the process of conciliation should be done exclusively by them. Section 31 provides for the likelihood that the parties to an industrial dispute may themselves arrive at an agreement to govern their industrial relations. This section does not say anything about the way in which they should do it. I refer to the Qantas dispute some years ago which was settled by an outside mediator. As I said in the debate on the second reading of this Bill, the Minister will find that the unions will not register agreements if there is a danger of the agreements being disallowed by appeal or otherwise. </para>
        <para>Proposed new sections 34, 35 and emphasise public interest. These provisions are a carry over from existing section 31 (3.) which states, inter alia, that the arbitration authority may refuse to certify if it in of the opinion that &#39;it is not in the public interest that the agreement be certified&#39;. Already today we have heard who is to define public interest. Time will not permit me to quote an interesting expression of opinion in a book called Better Employment Relations&#39; by Foenander but possibly at a later stage I will get the opportunity. It states briefly that the authorities make no attempt to state broadly what they mean by &#39;public interest&#39;. </para>

            <para>- I will not take long because we are racing against the clock and I do not wish to waste time over procedure. We must get on with the debate. Would it be possible to take these proposed new sections separately or in groups. I am not asking for any other clauses to be dealt with in this way at this stage. If the Minister will agree to this I am sure that it will facilitate the debate and will make the debate much easier to follow. It will be a cleaner and neater way in which to do it and in the long run will be much quicker. </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member for Stirling interjected, it could be a bit late now because he has spoken. I would have no objection to these proposed new sections being dealt with in this way, as long as the honourable member who raised the point understands the pressure under which we are operating in order to get this Bill through the House by the end of the evening. Consistent with that purpose, I would be happy to group together some of the sections in this clause. This would assist the House in dealing with clause 13 and certainly would meet the wishes of the honourable member for Moreton, who also has raised this matter with me. If we dealt with this on a flexible basis and if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> were to group together certain of the sections as the Committee proceeded, I think that would meet the wishes of the honourable gentleman and would assist clarification of the issues with which we will be dealing. </para>

            <para>- If I could have the indulgence of the Committee for just one moment, I think that this course of action would facilitate the debate immensely. The clause encompasses approximately 5,000 words and I think that the Committee is put at a great disadvantage trying to consider such a congregation or gathering of proposals. I am quite sure that my friend, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, would help the Committee. For example, there are here a number of proposals in this clause on which there is no difference between Government and Opposition parties. I am quite sure that this course of action would speed up the debate. </para>

However, as only the honourable members for Stirling and Hindmarsh have spoken, if it is the wish of the Committee that the debate should proceed along these lines I think that this will be acceptable to the Chair, provided that the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the Minister can give some indication of the exact divisions of clause 13. </para>

I think that if there were 2 parties to a dispute before a man who was both conciliator and arbitrator, there would be the risk of the parties holding back and refraining fom giving all their information to the man who wore the 2 hats. On the other hand, if he sat there as a conciliator simpliciter - nothing else - exercising no arbitral functions, I think there would be a complete revelation of all their difficulties. </para>

        <para>I hope i have convinced my honourable friend that 1 believe strongly in conciliation. I think that the emphasis in ail industrial activity should be placed upon conciliation and that the resort to arbitral functions should be attempted or resorted to only when things are grim. I regret that my honourable friends opposite do not agree, but I am persuaded that where 2 parties sit before a conciliator who enjoys the complete confidence of both parties and where they know that the conciliator is going out of his way to do his level best to ensure that there will be a meeting of the ways, one will see conciliation operate in a completely untrammelled sense. I believe that where he has imposed upon him the functions of an arbitrator, people will say: &#39;I wonder whether we should tell all&#39;. That is the fear I have about this matter and it is the only further observation I have on the particular proposed new section. </para>

I think I could do no better than to read some extracts from an article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> B. Sweeney, Q.C., which appeared in the &#39;Sunday Australian&#39;  of 30th April this year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sweeney</inline> prefaced  his  remarks - I  think we would all share this belief - by saying: </para>

          <para>We prefer these better standards to be reached with as little dislocation, hardship and loss as possible.

          <para>Probably most important and unfortunate are the proposals to separate conciliation and arbitration. </para>
          <para>At present when an application come* before the commission it is assigned to a commissioner or judge who proceeds to hold conferences or may decide to begin a hearing. He may, and very often will, combine the two processes by suggesting conferences at an appropriate time, and by taking part in them himself if desirable. He may make suggestions or express tentative views. Tha system is flexible and is working, as is shown by the increasing number of consent award*  .Hid  agreements. </para>

          <para>Allied with it is the task force system under which an industry or group of industries is to be assigned to a group consisting of a judge, .in arbitration commissioner and a conciliation commissioner.

At present each commissioner is assigned an industry or group ot industries and a feature of the commission is the pride a good commissioner takes in the industrial record of his industry.

        <para class="block">I think it is important to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sweeney</inline> has had some 20-odd years of experience in conciliation and arbitration matters. He understands the point of view at least of the unions and because of the number of times he has appeared against employers he probaby also understands the point of view of the employers and their representatives. It seems quite clear to me that the more formalistic or legalistic you make a system, or the more legal conditions or restraints you impose on the people, whether they be conciliation commissioners or arbitration commissioners, the worse it is from the point of view of the Act. </para>
        <para>It may well be that there should be some way - and there is provision for it in the present Act - in which the  President  can decide that a particular case should be. dealt with by a different arbitrator, once conciliation has failed, because the conciliator has become too involved in that case. I can see no possible reason why, when it comes to the final stage at which somebody has to make a decision in a conciliation case, a person who has been involved in that case should be excluded from being able to make that decision, and the whole argument has to be gone over again. </para>
        <para>As honourable members are no doubt aware, it is quite clear in this Act that any admissions, or whatever you like to call them, which have been made before the conciliation commissioner cannot be used during the arbitration proceedings. I think this is wrong, if for no other reason than that we are putting very strict legal constraints or restrictions on the people who we feel ought to be able to act as conciliators and arbitrators. If, during conciliation meetings, the unions feel that they have persuaded the conciliation commissioner on a point of some relevance that there is something to their case and that their members in fact will strike if they cannot get some particular concessions, it is ridiculous if none of this evidence can be put to the arbitration commissioner and if the arbitration commissioner who finally makes the decision is a completely different person from the conciliation commissioner who originally heard the matter. It seems self evident to me. I find it difficult to see why the Minister in fact has insisted on this separation of functions. </para>

          <para>of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sweeney</inline> to us or in fact his interpretation of himself to the Committee. I suppose that underlines the essential problems of trying to get harmony over the particular matters contained in this lengthy Bill. I felt that the honourable member was arguing against himself. He talked about concentration upon judicial functions. Unless I interpret the matter wrongly, I would have thought that the stage of conciliation by definition, and perhaps even by practice, was one in which there was an attempt to bring people together in their somewhat diverse views on a particular matter, but that if, that having failed, further action were necessary, then somebody had to make an interpretation - preferably a judicial interpretation - of an issue. In the first place, we are trying to deal with parties perhaps in a fairly highly personal sense. Secondly, you have failed to achieve your object and you are then dealing with an issue, a decision which is unlikely to be welcomed equally by both parties. To me it is entirely logical that that should be so. If you can accept that, as I realise the honourable member for Prospect does not, but as the Government does, then it seems to me that what is provided for in this clause is entirely in line with that for the better execution of what is intended. </para>

            <para>- If in fact you separate the conciliatory and arbitrary functions, then that is likely to be so. The arbitrator will come in at the arbitral stage and will not have puttered around trying to make friends of opposite views at an earlier position. This makes provision for that in the sense that the arbitral powers are given to the presidential member or the arbitration commissioner. In other words, as far as the presidential member is concerned, this means that the judicial function is being concentrated on the arbitral side. I would have thought that that was in line with what the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> was asking for last week in relation to earlier clauses of this Bill; that in fact if there is legal expertise relevant to this matter - and one can hardly deny that - then it might best be applied to the arbitral side because there, in effect, you are deciding on issues and legalities. The clause also provides that the presidential member is no longer confined to full bench matters. I interpret that to mean a greater flexibility of operation in these negotiations. I really think that is the nub of the matter. I believe that in any logic - and I would hope in practice - this would make for a better functioning of the dual functions of this particular body. </para>

          <para>-  The honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> misunderstands the purpose of the section. The purpose of the section is not to make the task of the arbitration commissioner easier. The philosophy behind the section is that the aim of the Bill must be to make the job of the conciliation commissioner easier. It is argued that if the conciliation commissioner is able to conciliate in an atmosphere in which concessions are offered by the parties to each other in order to get agreement, if, the concessions having been made, the agreement still fails to eventuate, the parties are more likely to make those concessions if they are not made in the presence of the person who ultimately will arbitrate. The theory behind the matter is that the person who arbitrates could erase from his mind the knowledge that he has gleaned during conciliation proceedings. So it is not to assist the arbitrator. It will not work to practice, but the theory of the Bill is that everything must be done to assist the conciliatory processes and it would be an assistance to the conciliatory processes if concessions made in the course of a conference were kept from the man who ultimately would have to move in and arbitrate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> is quite right when he says that almost invariably it is because the conciliation commissioner hearing the matter or bringing the parties together in conference has the ultimate power to arbitrate the issue that the parties will come to agreement. 1 have sat in on arbitration proceedings and appeared before commissioners. What happens is that the commissioners will say: Look, you have no hope of getting from me 3 weeks sick leave a year. I cannot give it to you because it would be breaking new ground, so forget about that.&#39; On the other hand, he says to the employers: &#39;If you expect to resist the unions&#39; claim for a 10 per cent shift allowance for night work, let me tell you now that I am going to grant it. I would have to, because we have always granted this as the standard in the normal course. Why do you not get together? What about the unions dropping their claim for 3 weeks sick leave and the employer facing up to the fact that if he does not give the 10 per cent allowance for the night shift, 1 will have no alternative but to award it?&#39; Those 2 examples over-simplify the matter because I am quoting cases where for years the full bench has laid down the normal standards for working conditions. But separate from these over-simple examples are some claims that are in the grey area, where there have been no Full Bench decisions by which a commissioner would feel bound. In these cases the commissioner, if he has arbitral powers to move in ultimately and settle the matter, can still rely upon his arbitral powers to bring about conciliation by saying: &#39;The Full Bench has not decided this matter yet and unless my decision is set aside on appeal 1 am inclined, as at present advised, to do this with this particular matter. The union may prefer not to have what I will give &#62;.nd take instead what the employer will give. &#91; suggest the parties get together. I will leave the room and I will come back when you want me to or I will resume the hearing tomorrow morning&#39;. This is the judicial use of arbitral power which makes it so much easier for conciliation commissioners to do the job they now do. lt is a notorious fact that conciliators who have no arbitrary powers under the present Act find themselves with less machinery or with fewer weapons with which to do the job they are required to do, than has a conciliation commissioner. 1 tell the Government that I know of no demands by employers for this provision. 1 have talked with representatives of employers and they agree with members of the Opposition that this sort of thing just will not work. The Government will find that it will not work. The honourable member for Denison is astray in thinking that this is designed to help the arbitrator, lt is not. </para>

          <para>-It is practical to conciliate with the threat of arbitration. Let us be realists about this matter. We know how hard it is in this place to keep what happens in the party room away from the opposing political party. The same thing will happen in respect of conciliation and arbitration. It would help the arbitrator to know what was said. Of course the Government recognises that what is said might not be said if the arbitrator knows, but the arbitrator is at a tremendous advantage. If 1 know how the system works I cannot imagine an arbitrator not talking to a conciliation commissioner who has the same social status and salary as he enjoys himself and who works in the same office. No-one will convince me otherwise no matter what is contained in the Bill about not confiding to the arbitrator things that were said during the negotiations. The arbitrator will find out. It would be unwise to say that a conciliation commissioner would defy the statute and give this information to the arbitrator, though I think he would. I think that in practice conciliation commissioners will tell the arbitration commissioners what happened because they will realise that the arbitration commissioners will be helped by knowing these things. However, let us assume that they will not tell and that conciliation commissioners will be loyal to the statute. We cannot say they will not unless we have proof, but the parties themselves will tell. A conciliation commissioner is not like a judge. For conciliation to succeed or for an arbitration commissioner to be successful he must build up a rapport with those who appear before him. </para>

        <para>When I was involved in industrial matters, most settlements were achieved at the Earl of Zetland Hotel in Adelaide after a case was over. We settled more disputes in the saloon bar of the Earl of Zetland Hotel than we ever settled in the Australian Natives Association building in the formal presence of arbitration commissioners. The saloon was where we really got down to business. The parties had a few drinks and relaxed. The representatives of the employers would give a little and the representatives of the employees would do likewise. This is really the guts of arbitration and conciliation if one only understands it. 1 will never forget an occasion when I met with a group of brick manufacturers. 1 would not budge and their representative would not budge. He had a cold which made him worse. I took him over to the hotel and I said: &#39;A marvellous thing for colds is Guiness&#39;s stout and brandy&#39;. He said: &#39;I will try it&#39;. I had to drink it myself so as to make the story sound good. In the end we reached agreement. He later felt that he had agreed to too much. I tried to get reimbursement from the union for the money I had spent on drinks but could not, so I did not feel very happy either. But, joking aside, it is in this informal atmosphere that can be created that one can dispense with the kind of technical, formal approach that I am afraid will be reinjected into proceedings under this proposed new section. </para>

          <para>- I certainly pay tribute to the capacity of the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> to solve disputes. Indeed, I suggest that that capacity will not go astray in the Opposition benches. He will, no doubt, have many disputes to settle from time to time to which he can turn his attention. I rise simply to draw to the attention of the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> sub-section (3.) of proposed new section 30. He will see from that that it is quite clear that there is no inhibition on the arbitrator in seeking to use his powers of conciliation during the arbitration process. I believe that the comments which he made in relation to that particular point were, in fact, a misconception of what is intended by this particular provision we are considering. I will not traverse the ground that has been covered by speakers from the Government side, particularly the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> and the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon),</inline> except to recognise that this is a bold step. It is a new departure. It is a fundamental proposition to separate the functions of conciliation from arbitration. The Government has received a number of representations towards this end and although the Committee should not see the proposal as being inserted simply because of any particular representation which has been received, I can assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that this was one of the matters which was very strongly represented to the Government. </para>

I can assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that this was one of the proposals that was strongly supported by all the major employer groups through the forum of the National Employers Policy Committee representing the top 30 employer groups throughout Australia. It certainly should not be seen to be included in the Bill simply because of those representations. I assure the honourable gentleman that those representations were made and they were made very strongly. The Government believes that the changes which are inherent in this fundamental proposal will make the processes of both conciliation and arbitration far more effective and will overcome the problems which have resulted in a number of cases from the blurring of the 2 functions under the existing procedures. </para>

        <para class="block">Speaking for myself I would say that it is probably reasonable enough that people representing both parties should attend such a meeting. At the same time if one side, for example the trade union side, felt that no good could be achieved by this, what is the point of attending the conference? What this proposed new section is really saying is that if a person just attends and does not open his mouth then it is all right. He may refuse to participate in the conference. But if he refuses to attend because the members of his union have said that there is no point in trying to achieve a compromise on a particular issue that person - the trade union secretary or a representative of the union - would immediately be penalised $1,000. To my mind this is a pointless exercise because a person can carry out his obligation by just attending the conference, sitting there and not doing anything. The provisions in this proposed new section amount to a threat against the unions as this Government likes to do on the question of arbitration, without any point whatsoever. </para>

          <para>-  The charge which the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> makes is not well founded. I can understand the annoyance in the case of a person who is asked by a conciliation commissioner to attend a compulsory conference and it is not convenient for the person to attend. But I put it to the honourable member that there must be a reason in all things. If you accept the principle of having compulsory conferences and giving to a conciliation commissioner the power to call a compulsory conference, surely we must give the commissioner the right to say: &#39;I want such and such an organisation here or the representative who has been intimately concerned with this matter and I want <inline font-weight="bold">Mr So-and-so</inline> who is the  president  or the secretary of a particular union.&#39; It has not been my experience that a person would go before such a conference, sit there and be dumb. If that did happen it would be my view that reason itself had been deserted because after all, when 2 parties are in conflict and they want the matter settled it would seem to me to represent the high water mark of insolence and indeed uselessness for an individual to go along to a compulsory conference and sit there like a month old blancmange. I put it to the honourable member for Prospect that there is the assertion of reason. </para>

        <para>I am wondering on this point whether I might invite the Minister to have a look at one aspect of this proposed new section, not necessarily in this chamber but perhaps in the Senate. Perhaps there could be added to paragraph (5.) of proposed new section 27 these words: &#39;Where a prosecution is launched under this section it shall be a defence to the prosecution if the person is not available on reasonable grounds.&#39; I could think of a variety of factors. Let us assume that the person was in another court when the conciliation commissioner said &#39;I want him here&#39;. Let us assume that the man was ill. Some people may say that a conciliation commissioner would not call the man in those circumstances. I am looking at the proposed wording of the statute. I do not think the Bill would suffer in any shape or form if some omnibus provision dealing with a situation of this kind were included in the legislation to this effect &#39;It shall be a defence to a prosecution under this section where the person requested to attend or required by the conciliation commissioner is not reasonably available.&#39; </para>

If one looks back at the history of this provision - and I have already mentioned this to the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> - it will be seen that it is not a new provision, lt has been in the Act for many years and 1 know of no cases in which it has been necessary to invoke this penalty. </para>

            <para>- I think this puts the matter in perspective and would tend to disabuse the apprehension of the honourable member for Prospect. The penalty is a maximum of 31,000 and I would be confident that the matters to which the honourable member for Moreton has adverted would be well taken care of in terms of the good sense of a court. I should also state that so far as I can recall 1 have received no representation from the trade union movement in relation to this matter but I will have my officers check this matter and if my understanding is not accurate I will certainly correct that impression before the debate is concluded on the remaining clauses. </para>

          <para>-  The Opposition supports the comments made by the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> I understand that the Opposition in the Senate may move an amendment along the lines suggested by the honourable member to provide that it shall be a defence to a prosecution under this proposed new section if a person can show that he had just cause for not attending the conference. The person may be sick or he may be away for other reasons. There are all sorts of reasons for a person being away, lt is not unusual to include in a section which carries such a penalty as a $1,000 fine some indication that a citizen has a defence based upon just grounds. The fact that this penalty has never been imposed or that it has never been found necessary to impose it in the past does not convince me that a defence provision ought not be included because we cannot be certain that the kind of men we now have in control of these procedures will always be in control. We would need only to have a commissioner or a presidential member who decided to exercise his right to act this way and, because we felt too tired today or tomorrow to take this p recitation, the whole Bill could be brought into discredit simply because somebody was unjustly treated under this proposed new section. The Opposition opposes these proposed new sections but we will not call a division on them because of the time factor. </para>

          <para>-  I also want to oppose proposed new section 27. I do so because of the way in which it is worded. I have risen in this debate lo agree with and support the remarks made by honourable members on this side. As the proposed new section is worded no excuse can be put forward by a person who is required to attend before any proceedings that are held and who does not attend. I oppose this proposed new section because I recall an occasion in 1965 or 1964 when there was a dispute in the vehicle building industry. Proceedings were held in a court in Adelaide and at that time one prominent trade union official from one of the metal unions was very ill. He did not live long after his appearance before the court. His appearance in court was one of the most disgraceful things I had ever seen. He was forced into the witness box and the learned gentleman on the bench put this unfortunate fellow through cross-examination in an attempt to get him to say that he was under a direction of his Federal body in the eastern States. I recall a particular person on the bench. He was from a western State and he kept sneering and saying &#39;The wise men of the east&#39;. I thought of the term &#39;The mugs from the west&#39;. Those honourable members who have been involved in industrial matters will get the meaning of what I have just said and why I used that term. I make no apology for using it. I have not mentioned the person&#39;s name. You are not permitted to mention his name in this place. I have used that term and if anybody can identify the person in question, that is his prerogative. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is no provision in this Bill for a person holding a position in an industrial organisation and who is sick to say &#39;I want somebody to represent me on this occasion&#39; because the attitude adopted by the gentlemen on the bench is one of: &#39;I want you here and this is the place to which you will come, and you will <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> cross-examined&#39;. I ask the Minister to check out what 1 have had to say in regard to this case which involved the Vehicle Builders Union although it did not involve a Vehicle Builders Union official. The dispute involved an organisation whose members saw fit to support it. They supported it because many of their members were out of work as a result of the claim against the employers in the vehicle building industry. It was the most shameful thing I have ever experienced. How would the Minister like his friends to be forced to submit to this type of cross-examination with all the bitterness that at times prevails in industrial disputes that have gone on for some 2 weeks or 3 weeks. </para>
        <para>I would also like the Minister to define much better the provisions of the proposed new section 27. I can understand these provisions where unions are directly involved or organisations are directly involved but for a penalty of this sort to be hanging over the heads of people who are more or less innocent bystanders in a dispute is more than the average person should be called upon to bear and is more than the average person in the community would tolerate if he knew the full facts of the case and the implications of the subject. I ask the Minister to give every consideration to re-writing paragraph (5.) of proposed new section 27 and also some of the other provisions referred to by honourable members on this side of the House. </para>

          <para>-  I should like quickly to reply to the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> It strikes me that the Government and everyone else is arguing, and we are supporting, that in arbitration and conciliation there should be as much democracy as possible in relation to unions. Recently in an extended series of strikes and subsequent proceedings before the Commission in relation to the Atlantean bus dispute in Sydney, union officials were given strict instructions by union members that the members would not drive Atlantean buses on a one-man basis. I cannot see the point in forcing the secretary of that union to go to court merely to repeat that his members had instructed him not to conciliate on the matter. Yet that secretary will be required to do so and should he leave the court before the Commissioner gives him permission to do so he will be liable to a fine of $1,000. To me that seems completely pointless. </para>

          <para>-  Proposed new section 28 is one of the most obnoxious sections in the clause and we will have to divide the Committee on it. This section prohibits the certification of an agreement or the making of a consent award where the agreement or the award includes provisions that effect standard hours, the minimum wage, female rates or any question of annual leave or long service leave with pay. This proposed section will put an end to all certified agreements. No union and few employers will bother to certify agreements or register agreements when they discover that before this can be done the whole agreement, having been hammered out by negotiation and conciliation between the parties, must go before the Full Bench of the Commission for approval. Under the Act as it now stands the Commonwealth will have the right as intervener to be represented by counsel at the hearing before the Full Bench to give reasons why an agreement ought not be certified, and the Commonwealth will do it. The Minister suggested in his second reading speech that the Government had given up the idea of giving itself the right of appeal against agreements and consent awards. The Government has done it in another way; a more subtle and more crafty device has been discovered to achieve the same end. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The proposed section provides that an agreement or consent award touching upon the minimum wage, the national wage, equal pay for the sexes or any question of annual leave or long service leave must be certified by the Full Bench. When the Full Bench proceeds to certify the proposed agreement or consent award the Commonwealth will move in as intervenor and use public funds to prevent the certification or registration of the agreement or the makins of the consent award. If there is anything better designed to throw a spanner into the works of industrial understanding I should like to know what it is. If one looks at the proposed new section 28 one sees in sub-section (2.) this mandatory provision: </para>

        <para class="block">I have taken the trouble to look up the ruling of the Industrial Court in the case Cameron v. AWU, reported in 1959 in the econd volume of the Federal Law Reports.

        <para class="block">Dunphy and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Morgan, with the Chief Justice dissenting, that a rule of the union that gives a union executive power to expel a member for misconduct, when the executive is merely of the opinion that the person is guilty of misconduct, is an invalid rule because it is too vague, imprecise and uncertain as to its meaning, and therefore must be struck down and removed from the union rule book. If that set of principles, deemed to be invalid for the purpose of union rule, is now to be enshrined as part of the statute, what a mockery that makes of the decision of the Industrial Court in Cameron v. AWU. </para>
        <para>Let us look at paragraph (b) of subsection (2.) which reads: </para>

        <para class="block">That is nonsense. 1 know all about the High Court ruling. The Government ought to recognise that some agreements might provide for things like seniority, absolute preference or preference for financial members of unions. procedures dealing with reinstatements, changes in techniques - all of them held by the High Court to be matters touching upon managerial prerogatives. I know all of this but one of the things we must learn in the 1970s is that the sacred thing called managerial prerogative cannot be treated as sacred any longer and notwithstanding the decisions of the High Court the time is coming when modern technology demands changes in techniques and alterations in procedures. No longer is it possible to leave all these decisions entirely to management. If the parties can reach agreement as to how they will operate, it is nonsense to say that it cannot be put into an agreement merely because it incorporates something which the Commission itself could not put there. The only body likely to object to an agreement of this nature is the Commonwealth Government and if the Government does seek to set aside an agreement which simply gives effect to an agreement reached between the parties as to techniques and operating procedures inside a factory, the Government ought to go out on its head. I can see no reason at all why these things should not be permitted in an agreement. </para>
        <para>Another matter I should like to mention in relation to proposed ne.w section 28 (2.) is that it provides that a Commissioner shall refuse to certify a memorandum or to make an award. &#39;Shall&#39; ought to be &#39;may&#39;. He should be given a discretion. </para>
        <para>I turn to proposed new section 31, which is really the nitty gritty of the clause. This proposed new section enables the Government to bring about its wage freezing policy, because it provides that the power of the Commission to make an award or to certify an agreement for, or altering, the standard hours of work, minimum wages, female rates or annual leave is exercisable only by a full bench, during which proceedings the Commonwealth itself can intervene to put its case for wage freezing. The Commonwealth has made it clear that it is very sorry to know that the waterside workers and the stevedoring companies have been able to settle their differences instead of having a nation-wide stoppage. They settled their differences by the shipping companies giving increased wages, against which under this proposed new section the Government could have intervened. I do not know where the Government thinks it is going. It calls for increased productivity. When the waterside workers and the miners double their productivity and get an agreement from the employers which recognises that fact, this Government wants to step in and prevent the agreement being put into force. I say no more about the matter at this stage because I think the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> will deal with this at length, but I say that we oppose these provisions of the Bill and will divide the Committee. </para>

I excuse myself from agreeing with the honourable gentleman. I respect his views, but the views he has put and the views which I put, 1 suppose, would indicate the philosophical differences which exist between the honourable gentleman and myself as far as the apparatus of arbitration is concerned. Might I take the last sentiments expressed by the honourable gentleman when he was referring to the agreement made between the Waterside Workers Federation and the shipping companies. That is a collective agreement made outside the Commission.

            <para>- That is the view of the shipowners. There is great virtue  -  I hope I have always tried to show it both here and elsewhere - in listening to the other man&#39;s argument, no matter how much von may disagree with it. I am not in any way rebuking the honourable member for Sturt, but I am taking the case now of 2 people who say: &#39;We are in agreement. Therefore the matter is settled, and other people who may be affected by it have no right to be heard&#39;. There are hundreds of thousands of people with no opportunity of access to arbitral or wage fixing tribunals, yet in a very real sense they are affected. One only has to mention the hundreds of thousands of pensioners; one only has to mention the shopkeepers, those who run their own businesses, and so forth. They are all affected. Let me take the case  .if  the Waterside Workers Federation and the shipping companies. As a consequence of the agreement between these 2 parties freight rates, in my judgment, will ultimately be increased. Who will pay for mat increase? The whole community will pay for it. I think this matter comes back to the sentiment expressed by the metaphysical poet Donne when he said: &#39;No man is an island entire unto himself. This is perfectly true. </para>

            <para>- Just control yourself. The honourable member can give me the benefit of his views when I sit down. No matter what we may do in this Parliament, it will affect many hundreds of thousands of people outside, even though they are not immediately concerned. I have given the illustration of the agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and the shipping companies. What I say is that in the whole of the apparatus and the procedures of arbitration today it is no longer possible to say: &#39;Here there are 2 parties and no other party is involved&#39;. The community in its corporate sense is involved, and somehow or other the body making the decision must listen to a view which comes before that body on behalf of the corporate community. 1 come to the point posed by the honourable gentleman for Hindmarsh in relation to proposed new section 28 dealing with public interest. I would agree with the honourable gentleman that this proposed new section and also perhaps proposed new section 31 are 2 of the most difficult proposed new sections in the entire BillTrie very term &#39;public interest&#39;, of course, is an elusive term. We have both subjective and objective forces to be impressed upon it in order to determine what is public interest. I suppose if we were to be asked today to express in a hundred words what is public interest in relation to a particular issue we would get 100 varying, quite different responses. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that I cannot deal in the fields to which the honourable gentleman is so tantalisingly attracted. I want to deal with public interest. Quite a number of cases have been gathered and are referred to in a very fine text book, which of course we all know, by Mills and Sorrell on federal industrial laws. It contains a whole collection of reports on cases in which the various arbitral bodies have decided whether or not public interest has been involved and whether or not it has been affected. My concern with the clause dealing with public interest, frankly, is that it is left to the conciliation and arbitration commissioner to decide whether or not an agreement is in the public interest. The conciliation commissioner is a layman. To the lawyer the term &#39;public interest&#39; is a little more definitive than it is to the layman. I know that this may seem a rather strange proposition to put, but that is the case. May I cite very quickly the views given in the celebrated Nordenfelt case of 1894. It is good sense, as the Committee will see in a moment. In this case Lord Watson said of public interest: </para>

          <para>The course of policy pursued by  a  country  in  relation to, and for promoting the interests of its commerce must, as time advances and as its commerce thrives, undergo change and development from various causes, which are altogether independent from the action of its Court. In England, at least, it is beyond the jurisdiction of her Tribunals to mould and stereotype national policy. Their function when a case like the present is brought before them is, in my opinion, not necessarily to accept what was held to have been the rule of policy a hundred and fifty years ago, but to ascertain what is the rule of policy for the then present time. </para>

        <para class="block">I am saying in 1972 that if a conciliation commissioner is called upon to determine public interest in 1975 he will be called upon to determine something, to find something, which may be completely and utterly different. Another collection of cases has been prepared by a very distinguished New South Wales judge, the late Chief Justice Jordan. In re Jacob Morris deceased he deals with public policy, a term that is interchangeable with &#39;public interest&#39;. He said: </para>

          <para>Public policy is not, however, fixed and stable. From generation to generation ideas change as to what is necessary or injurious, so that &#39;public policy is a variable thing. It must fluctuate with the circumstances of time&#39;. . . . New heads of public policy come into being, and old heads undergo modification. Thus, in the early part of the nineteenth century, prevalent social doctrine favoured a minimum of government interference in economic relations and a maximum of freedom of contract. In the course of a century the pendulum has swung the other way, and there has been an increasing tendency to regard it as necessary in the public interest to protect the weak against the strong, and even against themselves. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This brings me to the central argument I put on this clause: To find the public interest is the difficulty before the conciliation commissioner. In relation to proposed section 31, I will press upon the Committee argument to show that in many circumstances it would be possible for the parties to a dispute and the conciliation commissioner to deal with public interest and, for that matter, not to be referable to the Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission. The point made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth can in all cases intervene when public interest is involved, is in my view not well founded. If the matter has not been referred to the Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission the AttorneyGeneral cannot intervene. But it would be quite possible for a conciliation commissioner to have dealt with a matter that did involve the public interest but the parties agreed, there was no reference of the matter to the Full Bench and, as a consequence, it went unheeded. </para>
        <para>For example, let me take the case cited in Mills and Sorrell dealing with the substitution of a 7-day shift system in the glass industry for a 6-day system. The conditions under which such substitution should be permitted are of sufficient public interest to justify an appeal. I would respectfully agree with that but I could not put that decision under any one of the heads to be found in proposed section 31 of the Act. There the public interest would be involved, yet there we have an illustration of the fact that the Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission could not in any way interfere with the adjudication that had been made. In the Committee debate on proposed section 31 I will deal with it and elaborate on what 1 have said. </para>

          <para>- I join issue with the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> on the question of labour productivity. For example, in 1950 the average output a man/shift in the coal mines of New South Wales was about 2.8 tons. It is now broadly on the average of 10 tons a man/shift a day. I can que te for the honourable member a case &#60;n another field - in the field of marine transport - where a ship such as the &#39;Idemitsu maru&#39; transporting 210,000 tons of oil operating with a crew of 28. In pre-war times a crew of 28 would have operated the average freighter of 2,500 tons to 3,000 tons. So much for the analogies that the honourable member chooses to use. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>More seriously, my main objection to proposed section 31 is that it is literally a blueprint for a wage freeze without a price freeze. This is the nub of the whole Bill. If I might paraphrase the clauses under discussion, the Government&#39;s thinking is this: We are browned off with the whole system of conciliation and arbitration. We have seen its vagaries and vicissitudes right through the years. We have seen it stait off with the concept of a needs basic wage. We have seen it switch over to the principle of what was the ability of the economy to pay. We have seen quarterly adjustments tried and dropped. In 1967 we went to the concept of a total wage, and now confusion seems to be worse con founded so we are coming in with a Draconian measure. We are going to use the big stick and the heavy hand, irrespective of what might be done. We note, says the Government in its own counsels, a marked tendency on the part of both unions and employers to keep outside a system of arbitration which they claim to be expensive, provocative and frustrating. We note that, but we intend at all costs that every section of industry today will be drawn into it just as effectively as when a man gets his hand caught in a chaff cutter. Every section is to be included ;n the ambit of some aspect of arbitration am&#39;, of course, with Government intervention. </para>
        <para>Notably, right through *he years the various sections of the arbitration system have been reluctant really to come to grips with economics. Of course, that is only to be expected in the case of lawyers, for a very obvious reason. Traditionally the Bench, in ordinary common law cases, acts merely on the evidence as put before it. The Government now proposes that it will come in as and when it suits it. irrespective of the merits of the case, and it will say: This is contrary to the public interest&#39;, the arbiter of public interest in all cases being the Government itself. Throughout recent submissions - I speak of the period since 1967 in particular - the Government has not been able even to define its own objectives. We have had eminent QCs, briefed by the Crown Solicitor, appearing on behalf of the Government and saying: &#39;We want a moderate increase.&#39; But when asked by the Bench &#39;What is a moderate increase?&#39; they do not know. They cannot give a better definition than that. The fundamental problem with arbitration today is that we have no power to legislate. Proposed sections 31, 34 and 35 and also the proposed amendment in clause 16 together constitute an economic, industrial and legal straitjacket for the trade union movement. Let there be no mistake about that on the part of any honourable member in this Parliament or any person in Australia who is listening to this debate. It is an economic straitjacket. </para>
        <para>Not satisfied with a miserable increase given in the national wage cas: that had no relevance at all to the increase in the cost of living, the Government now proposes to ensure that in the future wage justice will be denied. I say literally &#39;wage justice&#39;, because what is given in the future will depend on the whim and caprice of the Government. I want to refer to and commend an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> Fitzgerald in Finance Week&#39; in which he pointed out that the Government has not confidence even in its own judiciary acting in the Arbitration Commission. It must intervene. It must dictate. The Government is not a party to these matters, and the original concept of arbitration, according to the founding fathers of Federation, was to do 2 things - to settle disputes quickly and to fix wages. The less intervention there is from the Government, the better for all concerned. You can go throughout the world today, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> you will not find any parallel to the legal paradox that exists in Australia. The longer this system continues in its present form with blatant, unrestrained and barefaced Government intervention, the worse it will get. </para>
        <para>These sections will be the death knell of the system of arbitration, mark my words. The system will be completely destroyed by them. When trade unionists - nien whose only commodity for sale is their labour - have to go into a court to put forward in good faith, as these amendments provide, a case based on economics and statistics, prepared at great expense and presented with great skill, and then the Government comes in and plays its legal joker - its trump: This is contrary to the public interest. It cannot be done. That precisely is the charter that is being spelt out at the present time. In addition I want to refer to proposed section 31 which says: (1.) The power of the Commission to make an award, or to certify, under section twentyeight of this Act, an agreement - </para>

            <para>- Exactly. Yet the Government chooses to try to spell this out. Let us put it another way: It is the considered opinion - not merely the considered opinion but the certain opinion - of the legal profession that the minute these proposed sections are challenged the High Court will knock them out. And a challenge there will be because under the Constitution as it stands at present this Government cannot impose conditions such as these. The Government will put in these proposed charges. It will put them in by sheer weight of numbers because it has the numbers to do so. The Government will ram this legislation through and the High Court will kill it for certain. </para>

        <para>Or SOLOMON (Denison) (4.51)- I cannot hope to traverse the legalities of this matter and the legal evidence of what has happened in the past with the same dexterity as did the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> I was happy to hear the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> because he made a clear argument concerning his reservations about this matter. I could understand perfectly well what he was talking about. In particular he said that this legislation is laying down a blueprint for a wage freeze without an equivalent in the price area. I can understand people having reservations about that. However, I believe I should say just a few words if only for the reason that my speaking does not leave it look as though there are only 2 supporters of the Government who believe that this is a justifiable clause. </para>
        <para>The dangers which confront the implementation of this clause, as outlined by the honourable member for Cunningham, are indeed dangers to think twice about. Nevertheless I think again, if I can take this matter on the face of it and as it reads, that it is hardly proper in these days to consider an award or an agreement which only takes cognisance of 2 parties. My friend the honourable member for Moreton has taken this on board very well but I think it should be said again that one has only to consider instances, and some already have been given. Let us assume that there is an agreement between the managemnt of the Australian National Line and the seamen or stewards concerned in that operation, and there has been evidence of this before now. Let us assume that there is an award which is what we might describe as generous and let us exclude from any judgment on the rights or wrongs of the matter the people of Tasmania, for example. Where does that get us lt seems to me that the people of Tasmania at least have as vested an interest in that agreement as do the seamen or the stewards, or whoever else might be concerned, lt would be entirely unrealistic not to consider the public interest. </para>
        <para>If such an agreement is entered into, as honourable members of the Opposition have pointed out who else but the Government is going to represent the public interest in most circumstances? After ill, that is what one would think it is there to do. In fact, the bane of any governments existence is to decide which public interest is more persuasive or more deserving than any other public interest because rarely is the whole public involved at any one time. I think the case which I took illustrates this point. If it were the public of Tasmania, of north Queensland or whoever else it might be, or for that matter the whole public, surely someone needs to represent them if the government or anyone else sees them as worthy of representation in the context of a particular agreement. For that reason 1 say a few words on this part of the clause. I &#39;believe that the provisions contained in this part of the clause are justified. I hope that the dire industrial straits that are predicted as a result of the passing of this clause do not come to pass. But on the face of it I believe that what is proposed is a reasonable proposition as far as the people of Australia in general are concerned. </para>
        <para>May I take up just one other point because 1 think that it was raised a good deal earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb).</inline> This matter concerns proposed new section 30. The honourable member was worried in regard to proposed new sub-section 30 (1 .) about the suggestion that conciliation and arbitration evidence and findings could not in any practicability be kept one from the other. I would like to point out that proposed new section 30(4.), as I understand it, gives a particular meaning to a couple of the words; that is to say proposed new sub-section (4.) provides that no evidence shall be given from one conciliator, for example, to a succeeding arbitrator. This means evidence as distinct from hearsay, as I understand it. Also, the proposed new sub-section states: &#39; ... or statements made . . . &#39;. Again, I believe that this refers to statements made to the Commission that are not to be transferred from one quarter to the other. Therefore, whatever the human weaknesses of the problem may be, these are specific matters which are not talked about in the Bill as though they were a popular chat; they are matters relating to evidence particularly and the statements made to the Commission, so that in a formal sense they are not transferable. </para>
        <para>I draw the attention of honourable members - and I am sure that the lawyers here could do so better than I am able to do - to the fact that on many occasions juries are ordered by a judge to disregard a piece of evidence. No-one really believes that they totally cleanse their minds of that evidence. All they have to do is to do their best not to consider it as part of the total evidence they are receiving. I presume that legally trained people such as conciliators and arbitrators can do that equally as effectively as a jury drawn from the average population can. So 1 make that point in addition to the remarks I have made relating to the preceding proposed new section. </para>

Honourable members opposite have said that they have been caused through savage attacks on employers by unions and unionists. In order to overcome this economic problem which it does not understand, the Government has resorted to union bashing. The minimum wage is about $54 a week. Anyone who calls that a magnificent wage should try to live on it. On the other hand, the average wage is about $100 a week. What does this all mean? It means that a lot of people in the community are receiving much more than the minimum wage. Further, it means that individual unions have been engaged in collective bargaining with individual employers to obtain better rates of pay and, in the case of the waterside workers and other unions as well, better working conditions. I mention the waterside workers because their union has reached agreement with their employers for a shorter working week. This has not pleased the Government at all. As a result it has introduced proposed new section 31 in which it will not be possible for individual unions to make individual gains from individual employers. </para>
        <para>Perhaps we should look at the situation as to why unions are succeeding in their individual claims. They succeed not because they blackmail employers or because they do all of the things that are alleged against them. I would be of the opinion that the unions are successful because the employers agree to increases. They agree not under duress but on the basis of negotiation. The Government believes that something is wrong if it is possible for individual employers to agree to substantial increases in wages for their employees. </para>
        <para>Somebody is getting too big a share of the national cake, and I am speaking here of the employers. Some employers are engaged much more profitably than others. Once again there is a division. There is no levelling out and no attempt by this Government to level out that sort of share of the national cake. If the working people in this country, through their recognised organisations, seek increases, this Government through measures like this makes sure that they are not able to get them. It hamstrings them and ties them. The honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> recognised some of these problems because he said he would think twice about the dangers. I think he should think five or six times about the dangers because they are inherent in this sort of legislation which sets about destroying the whole basis of conciliation. This Act is termed the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Conciliation is not restricted only to the clinical confines of a court. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> has explained - I also have been party to such negotiations but perhaps not in the same places as he has negotiated though in places of a similar kind - conciliation takes place between employer and employee representatives away from the clinical atmosphere of a court. This is also conciliation. Conciliation does not have to be carried out in the atmosphere of a court. Proposed new section 31 takes away entirely the right of employees to negotiate. It also takes away the right of employers to negotiate. That to my mind will not do anything to resolve the alleged - I use that word advisedly - unrest which exists in this country. If that was the reason why this Bill was brought in then it will not achieve it. </para>
        <para>On the question of the shorter hours that have been negotiated by the Waterside Workers Federation, the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> against this agreement were not surprising. I forget the date but I remember reading of similar arguments made against the repeal of the corn laws in Great Britain, and that was more than 100 years ago. The same arguments were put forward when the. child labour laws were introduced in Great Britain and children were brought out of the mines and factories. The arguments then were that the economy could not stand it. The same is being said in 1972. I support the proposition that with mechanisation as we have it, particularly on the waterfront but generally in any industry, there can be no logical argument to sustain a case against individual employees and industries negotiating with their employers for a shorter working week in those industries. This concept is not new either. I remind this Committee that in the United States of America, the bastion of free enterprise, and in most other countries, people are working a much shorter week than we are in Australia. We speak about a 40-hour week as though it was something sacred. There is not a clerical officer employed by the Government that you support, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> who works a 40-hour week. These people work some peculiar time like <inline font-style="italic">36i</inline> hours a week. Does anybody say that the country would benefit if they worked the extra <inline font-style="italic">3i</inline> hours a week? Of course not. Why should they work longer hours? Probably they should work fewer hours than they are working now, and people in particular industries should be working fewer hours. </para>
        <para>The country is beset with problems of inflation and unemployment, yet the Government still talks about there being no area of negotiation between individual employees and employers. There is little doubt in my mind that this provision will be agreed to, but it will hamstring employees and employers in this regard completely. Everybody will work a 40-hour week irrespective of the conditions that apply in their industries. Everybody will receive the same wage irrespective of the capacity of their employers to pay. Where does that leave us? It means that for those employers who have a greater capacity to pay - and this Government will not do anything about rectifying that position through the obvious means of taxation - the money will remain in their coffers and they will not be worried about overseas corporations taking over our chicken roll and dim sim factories. lt will go a lot further than that. I urge the Committee to disagree with the inclusion of this provision in the Bill and vote with the Opposition, the Party which is taking an intelligent approach to this matter, to take this provision out of this Bill altogether. </para>

          <para>- The subjects raised by honourable members who have spoken on the proposed new sections contained in clause 13 are covered by 3 main headings - certification of agreements, matters reserved for full bench hearings, and the public interest. Dealing first with the certification of agreements, this was raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> and I would like to point out that there is no difference between the certification of agreements proposed under this Bill and provided for under the Act because the certification has to be undertaken by a presidential bench. This is laid down in the Act in section 33, so there is no difference in that respect. On the question that it is wrong not to be able to include matters in an agreement which cannot be included in an award, there is no change from the existing section 31 of the Act. I should point out that there is not much point in giving the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to certify an agreement which contains matters that could not be included in an award because this is beyond its constitutional power. The aim of certifying an agreement is to give it the power of an award and if the agreement contains things which could not be included in an award constitutionally, the award obviously could not stand up to challenge. As to the matters to be referred to the full bench, there is not a great deal new in what is proposed here. The national wage cases are added to the list of matters that must be dealt with by the full bench. In recent years these cases have been heard by the full bench on reference and quite often by agreement. </para>

            <para>- Public interest is the third heading I referred to and I will take it last. The national wage cases in the past have been dealt with by the full bench on reference, usually by agreement, and the new provisions in the Bill really formalise what is currently the de facto situation. The only equal pay case which has been heard by the full bench was heard on reference. On the question of annual leave, I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh and every honourable member would agree that annual leave is a major cost item in the economy. As long service leave has always been dealt with by a full bench it seems quite reasonable that annual leave should be in the same category. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The minimum wage, the last item added to the list, has always been dealt with by a full bench and I would draw the attention of the Committee to the definition of &#39;basic wage* which is contained in section 33. (1.) (b). I ask the Committee to compare that definition with what is contained in proposed new section 31. (1.) (c). lt will be found that the definition of minimum wage&#34;, which is now to be dealt with by a full bench, is very similar to the old definition of &#39;basic wage&#39; which was always dealt with by a full bench when that principle applied. The Commonwealth has always had the right of intervention in Full Bench matters and this will not be changed under the new legislation. </para>
        <para>I come to the final point which relates to the public interest. The honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> pointed out very cogently that this question doss extend beyond the parties to the immediate consultation or dispute which is in progress. I cannot put it better than the extract from Shonefield in his &#39;Note of Reservation to the Donovan Report&#39; which I quoted in my speech last week during the debate on the second reading of this Bill. I think that this is so relevant that I should include it in the record of this debate. Shonefield said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is no longer possible to accept the traditional notion of the individual work place as  a  separate and largely  automonous  estate where employers and employees are able to conduct their quarrels with little or no regard to the effects of what they do on other work places. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I cannot put the concept of public interest in clearer words than that. The honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> accused the Government of putting the system into an economic strait-jacket. I think that if we got down to trying to define &#39;public interest&#39; in strict and specific terms, we might be doing exactly what the honourable member said because the public interest will change according to circumstances. There will be different degrees of importance depending on such factors as the nature of the matter at issue and the political climate of the day. This inevitably must affect public interest. Of course, a particular case may have the effect of influencing or affecting the whole of industry, quite apart from the industry which is under discussion or negotiation. Because of the implication? of a particular industry, it may not be in the best interests of the public to extend this effect into fields other than those which originally had been part of the discussion. </para>
        <para>Another point which the honourable member for Moreton made and which is exemplified in the quotation I gave a moment ago is that, in certain circumstances, parties may reach an agreement which is highly satisfactory to them because the industry employer concerned may be in a position where he is able to pass on his costs without too must trouble. This clearly could be against the best interests of the economy as a whole. So, while I agree that it is impossible specifically to define the public interest, I think it is wise to leave it to the discretion of the commissioner and not end up, by defining it too strictly, with the sit..... &#39;&#34;n about which the honourable member for Cunningham expressed concern. The original concept of the public interest i&#34; our conciliation and arbitration system was expounded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Isaacs in 1917. He made the point that the whole raison d&#39;etre of the arbitration powers was not the mere decision between 2 contesting parties, although that of course was undoubtedly of importance because &#39;h purpose of the legislation was to resolve industrial disputes; the object of the Commission must always be that the community be served uninterruptedly and not be compelled, when threatened with deprivation or perhaps the essentials of existence, to look on helplessly while those whose function it is to supply them stop their work to quarrel. I think that the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Isaacs are just as true today as when they were originally said. So, in relation to those  3  matters which are the principal causes of debate on proposed new sections 28 to  31  - certification of agreements, matters reserved for the full bench and public interest  -  1 maintain that the proposals of the Government are designed to improve the system and maintain the public interest of the community of Australia. </para>

          <para>- Like my colleagues, I am very concerned about the words &#39;public interest&#39;. I am concerned for 2 reasons. I do not see any coherent body anywhere in Australia which can define or represent the public interest. 1 think that applies more to the present Ministry than to any other group of people which may wish to present evidence in a court. I use as an example something which is current in Australia and which I think indicates the lack of clarity that there can be on any issue at any one time about what is the public interest. Someone, somewhere, will go into a court with the force of law and demand that what has been said at a particular time to be the public interest shall be complied with. There is on the bookstalls at the moment a publication called &#39;The Little Red Schoolbook&#39;. It is on the bookstall at the Canberra Airport. </para>

            <para>- Just a moment. On the front bench of the Government Parties is the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> who says that it is in the public interest that this book be distributed, there is the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> who says that this is a subjugation of the rule of law and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay)</inline> who makes similar comments. I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and the Assisting Minister assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> - I do not use them as examples because this is a different matter - how they could define in circumstances such as this what in fact is the public interest. If they were to go into a court on an economic matter, they most likely would say: &#39;Well, economic matters are a little more clear cut. If the workers want more wages, it is in the public interest that they should not get them&#39;. That is what the Government has always said, lt has said that although the workers want lower working hours, it is in the public interest that they do not get them. 1 suppose that one could say that the public interest is clearly definable in this area. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There is conflict among Government Ministers on what is in the public interest in economic matters. For instance, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> believed that the Australian dollar should be maintained at its parity with sterling. The Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> - the de facto Prime Minister - maintained that it should be devalued. So it was devalued. Who is to say that that decision was in the public interest? The decision was reached purely because of the brute forces of Party politics which operated within the coalition. The public interest had nothing whatsoever to do with the decision. Any decision which is reached by the present Cabinet and, in all probability, by successive cabinets on what should be done in wage cases will be arrived at on the basis of what is in the political interests of the government of the day. It will have nothing whatsoever to do with the public interest. Let us not be completely hypocritical about the situation. </para>
        <para>How can anyone suggest that, even with the myriad of advisers which the Government has available to it and who, 1 hope, would disagree pretty violently not only with the Government but also with one another - if they were doing their job they would have to disagree - that the Government, on the basis of this advice, can arrive at a clear-cut decision on what is in the public interest? It is now only 8 months since the Government came into this Parliament and said that it was in the public interest to increase taxation in Australia and it is now about 1 month since it came into the Parliament and said that it was in the public interest that that mistake be corrected. If a mistake of this nature is made in the national wage case, the Government is not dealing with an increase of 20c a week for the person on $70 a week; it is dealing with his ability to maintain his standard of living. If the national wage case does not give to people that level of wages to which they are entitled, they have no other area from which to obtain them. This is especially so with those people who are in the weaker bargaining positions, such as employees of State governments. </para>
        <para>Reference has been made to increases in productivity. By way of interjection railway drivers were mentioned. I make this point: A train crew of only 2 people can now drive any number of locomotives. The number of vehicles on trains has been considerably increased and the average tonnages which are drawn per man hour have considerably increased. But the relativity of the rates of pay of the engine drivers, who are responsible for this increased productivity, when compared with a fitter&#39;s rate of pay, are now 25 per cent lower than they were 20 years ago. In fact, engine drivers have increased their productivity by more than 100 per cent but their relative pay rates have dropped. Where is the public interest in that? What is all this talk about people benefiting from increased productivity? What the court has said is that the employer has invested money in the industry and the employees are not entitled to the benefit of the results flowing from that investment. This is what has happened in the railways. When one asks people to increase productivity so that they will obtain increases in real wages one should remember that those people who have increased their productivity substantially over the years have in fact had their relative wages reduced. So let us not kid ourselves about what is in the public interest in that situation. </para>
        <para>The crux of this matter is that the Government is writing into this legislation provisions for making a political judgment which could have been legally made had the Australian people supported the referendum on wages in 1946. They did not do so, and now what the Government is trying to do is to find semi-legal methods - because I doubt very much whether it is a constitutionally valid proposition - to get around the decision of the Australian people, because the Government knows that if this question were put to the Australian people again by way of referendum, it would be defeated. </para>
        <para>The facts of the matter are that no matter what way one looks at this clause, it is not possible for any group of people sitting in a parliament, or in any other area, to define what in fact is in the public interest. A group of people can define what is in the economic interests of some of the employers, what is in the economic interests of some of the employees, or what is in the political interests of the party which happens to have power or those parties which happen to be able to exert the maximum political pressure- not necessarily those parties which govern. We are perpetuating this situation in this legislation, and what is going to be said in court will not necessarily be in the public interest. It may be what the Treasury thinks is in the public interest, which may be totally opposed by the Department of Trade and Industry, and this is not an unusual situation. It may be what is in the immediate political interest of some section of some political party. As I have said previously, there are sitting on the front bench at question time here 3 Ministers who, on another subject, quite publicly are expressing 3 different versions of what is in the public interest. Who is to say which version is right? The judgment day has not arrived yet. I do not believe that this is a valid point. I believe that this is a very dangerous process to put into a system in order to determine by a fairly unscientific manner what levels of wages and conditions should be provided within the community. </para>

          <para>- The honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> mentioned public interest, and I intend to elaborate on that point a little further. It is inexplicable to me and to many other people just what is the interpretation of public interest&#39;, which was mentioned by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Corio. I should like to know in what branch of industry stoppages have not occurred. I will mention a few of the people who are connected with services which are rendered in the public interest: pilots, first and second officers, flight engineers, flight stewards and hostesses of Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines, and Ansett Airlines of Australia; ships engineers, ferry and dock boat captains, private bank officers, newspaper journalists, members of Actors Equity, members of the musicians Union, white collar workers, prison warders - the prisoners offered to walk out in sympathy with warders - members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, members of the Australasian Society of Engineers, ironworkers, sheet metal workers, waterside workers, transport workers, boiler makers, plumbers, ships painters and dockers, liquor trade employees, glass workers, milk industry employees, meat workers, jockeys, members of the Australian Workers Union, clerks, miscellaneous workers and many others. Who is left in the public outside those people whom I have mentioned? I do not think there would be many other people who render services in the public interest. The Assistant Minister assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> made a statement about the economy and what we must do to protect it. I repeat what I said last week: This is strange when one considers the statement made by the Government in regard to the Kerr report on salaries for members of the Commonwealth Parliament. That report recommended a salary of $13,000 for a private member, but the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> wanted to reduce it to $12,000 because of the state of the economy at that time.In other words, he was going to make a big fellow of himself. This Bill provides for an increase, from  $12,000 to $16,400, in the salaries of conciliation commissioners, retrospective to last November. Is that in the interests of the economy? Of course it is not. What a lot of rubbish. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The decision in regard to the &#39;Little Red Schoolbook&#39; that was mentioned earlier by my friend was not a decision of the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp);</inline> it was a decision of the Cabinet of which the Minister is a member. Was that done in the public interest, as explained by my friend? That was not the decisionof the Minister for Customs and Excise; it was the decision of Cabinet - the 12 ruling members. 1 should hope that in future my friend does not put the blame for that decision on the Minister for Customs and Excise when he was only one of the men who were responsible for making it. Was that decision in the public interest? These are the things which, as I have said, are inexplicable to many people in Australia. Just what is the public interest? We would like the Minister for Labour and National Service or the Assistant Minister assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service to give us. at the earliest possible opportunity, aninterpretation of what is in the public interest. </para>

          <para>- I want to address myself very briefly to the question of what is in public interest. I think that a lot of double standards and hypocrisy have been spoken by the Government in regard to this matter. I think that if ever a section of a Bill set out to epitomise this Government&#39;s attitude on the question of restraint, this section does. What do we mean by public interest? I can well recall a test case in the South Australian jurisdiction, I think in 1930. following the Premiers&#39; Plan to implement throughout Australia, by the respective State governments and the Commonwealth Government, a 10 per cent reduction in salary across the board in the national or public interest. The police officers took the case to the full bench in South Australia, and the full bench rejected the State Government&#39;s application on the grounds that in fact it was not in the public interest. This was a case where the lawyers on the bench acted contrary to legislative decisions. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What do we do in the position where public interest is relative? What happens in the cases where 5 or 6 States outflank the Commonwealth in certain areas? Let me take one example. The question of nurses was raised earlier. Psychiatric nurses in South Australia, from juniors to career and charge sisters were granted equal pay in 1967. In Queensland at that time it was decided that it was against public interest to grant equal pay to psychiatric nurses in Queensland; it was granted only to certificated nurses and sisters. In New South Wales in 1967 Judge Sweeney granted equal pay to psychiatric nurses across the board without any 5-year waiting period - again in the public interest, according to the judge. In Tasmania psychiatric nurses were granted equal pay on a restrictive basis - again, I assume, in the public interest. Psychiatric nurses in Western Australia were granted equal pay in a more restricted area - again, I assume, in the public interest. I ask the Minister, if unions and employers sat around the table and, on a balanced evaluation of the situation in the 6 States, found that something was in the national interest according to the States in direct opposition to the Commonwealth, an agreement could not be ratified on that basis because according to the Commonwealth Government it was against the public interest. Such an attitude in my view is totally illogical. In that case the agreement could not be ratified. It would have to go to the Full Bench. </para>
        <para>A similar situation applies with respect to annual leave. As I understand it, in South Australia annual leave is applied in the Public Service on the basis of 4 weeks leave for day workers and 5 weeks leave for shift-workers. I understand this position applies likewise in New South Wales. Let us assume that this trickles and percolates through the other States. Is it unreasonable for unions and employers collectively to sit around the table and figure out that an industry can afford to make such provision in the State jurisdiction in which they are negotiating? We could have the ridiculous situation that despite all efforts at conciliation, a matter may be agreed by both parties but the agreement cannot be ratified. However, it can be opposed by the Commonwealth Government on appeal. </para>
        <para>The recent Waterside Workers Federation agreement is another classic example. Do we assume that for peace on the waterfront this agreement which is applicable to waterside workers will remain in that restricted area? I doubt it very much. It is possible that other unions on the waterfront will press for conditions identically in line with those applicable to waterside workers. If there can be agreement between unions and employers why cannot that be ratified without the hammer and sickle being hung over their heads by the Commonwealth Government, on appeal? The Government makes a farce of all semblance of conciliation between organisations. </para>
        <para>I turn to the question of double standards. The honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> rose and made a great play about the public interest. He quoted legal decisions. I do not dispute those decisions. Wages have a decisive impact on the community but the fact which cannot be got over to the Government is that what is wrong at this point of time is that extra weight is being put on one end of the scale and nothing on the other end. If there is a public interest on an increase in wages across the board nationally or by collective bargaining, what standard will the Government fix when prices rise, hire purchase rates rise and land prices rise? All one ever hears from the Government is this double standard. The private sector, in terms of prices and profits, is to be completely uninhibited. It will have complete freedom to contract and no Government controls will be imposed. Everyone read the statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> last December dealing with general insurance provisions. There were 2 important factors in that statement as far as the Commonwealth Government was concerned. There are to be no restrictions on insurance companies in terms of investment - none at all. So, the private sector can have complete freedom of contract, complete freedom of negotiation, complete freedom of fixation of either prices or profits and, in fact, freedom from any restrictions, inhibitions and constrictions. But, certainly, it will not be involved in arbitration. The Government will confine this provision to the workers of Australia. In my view the Government will bind the workers by a section which is inoperative and which will cause untold damage in the field of conciliation and arbitration. In my view it will be completely inoperative. </para>

          <para>- I do not believe that the honourable members for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> and Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> should be allowed to get away entirely with their arguments. In particular, my honourable friend from Corio put some of the worst arguments by analogy which it has been my misfortune to hear. At the same time I concede that a good deal of what the honourable member for Hawker in particular had to say was persuasive and even tenable because he was concerned about a situation where he can point to various groups in the community, particularly those on the higher levels of income who do not appear, on the face of it, to be subject to the test of public interest. He can say with justification perhaps that those at the lower end of the economic scale subject to decisions which affect the mass of workers are the ones who are being singled out for bringing in the question of public interest. That may appear to be so but it is not as much so as he thinks it is. The reason for it is this: In a great deal of legislation, in a great deal of adjudication and judgments made by public service boards or bodies other than the Commission about which we are talking here, there is an implied public interest to be considered. There is not only one public interest as can be readily seen. The public interest would not be well served if university teachers, for example, were paid a wage or salary which was not comparable with that which they could get overseas because if that situation applied we would very likely find the sort of migration which created the much talked about brain drain from the United Kingdom where people qualified to do a particular job were going somewhere else because they were offered competitive salaries on an international basis. So there are other checks and balances in other areas, particularly where they impinge on international situations, that one does not find at this level because of the lack of competitiveness. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I was nearly howled down last week, if I may say so, because I pointed out the simple fact that the sort of judgments we are talking about tonight usually affect hundreds of thousands of wage earners and, in that sense, are more important. These judgments, even though the per capita amount granted may be less than honourable members opposite would like to see - and members of this side would like to see - have an aggregate effect that is of considerable proportions. If we turn to some other area of the economy, to wage earners in occupations where a few hundred or a few thousand are involved, such as our arbitration commissioners, and give a substantial increase, the total effect on the economy is very small. Honourable members opposite were not prepared to accept that as realism last week, but this in fact is what dictates the situation. Competitive ability obviously is different at different levels and whether members opposite want that to be so or not with all their talk of equality in such areas as education the situation will not change for their saying so. It must be recognised on the question of public interest per se that this is so. I agree, and I would be stupid to do otherwise, that this is not an easy area to define. But the fact is that the honourable members opposite do not want to define anything they can possibly leave aside. We saw this last week in relation to clause 8 when members opposite were not prepared to recognise that some people would be in good community standing. They asked what that meant and sought examples. Members of the Opposition want to run away from this sort of thing. I submit that it is possible in a particular context, at a particular time and in a certain judgment to define what is the public interest. I have alluded, as have the Assistant Minister assisting the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> and the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> to judgments which could be made which would be contrary to the public interest. Even though it may be a little galling I admit this, because some other areas of operation apparently are not subject to public interest. Because the words are not written in, it does not mean that the public interest is not being taken into account. </para>
        <para>I would agree that there is plenty of argument to say that public interest per se should be looked to in other matters but there is no need to get absolutely wild about the situation when the public interest is referred to specifically in this case. In fact if one thinks about any degree of distance from this area at all, a good deal of our social legislation, if not the whole lot, implies public interest. You are not allowed to knock people off in the street because it is contrary to the public interest. You are not allowed to have a violent demonstration insofar as people can control you because it is not in the public interest. The fact that the particular forms of legislation do not use the words &#39;in the public interest&#39; does not mean that the public interest is not being served by the legislation. I believe that these things should be taken on board when in fact honourable members opposite find themselves as adamantly opposed to this form of words as they appear to bc in this debate now. I believe, in short, that the public interest can be judged in a particular context. It is true that there may be various judgments about it but surely this is what Government, arbitration and all these sorts of things are about - making judgments as to which particular interest should best be served at a particular time. </para>

          <para>- I have just a couple of questions I wish to put to the Minister. I am genuinely concerned and perhaps a little confused in regard to this matter. My questions arise out of proposed new section 28. Already a lot has been said about the expression &#39;the public interest*. I share the cencern about the uncertainty of it. I ask the Minister whether he can assist honourable members in regard to this. When one looks at the expression &#39;the public interest&#39; in the context in which it first occurs in proposed new section 28 (2.) it will be seen that it refers to the giving of power to a conciliation commissioner to refuse to certify a memorandum that has been reached by agreement between the parties where the parties have struck a bargain and are prepared to put the terms into a memorandum. This is what they want to do and they put it before the commissioner for certification. This provision will give power to a commissioner to refuse to certify the memorandum if he considers it is not in the public interest. So be it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Turning to the proposed new section 35, which I appreciate is not under discussion but which is linked with proposed new section 28, the right of appeal is given to certain listed people. Proposed new section 35 sub-section (3.) reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An appeal does not lie under the last preceding sub-section unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That contains the expression &#39;the public interest&#39;. Presumably there is to be a decision by a conciliation commissioner saying: 1 will not certify this agreement that you, the vitally interested people concerned, have reached. 1 will not certify it because it is not in the public interest&#39;. Then the Bill gives the right of appeal to the Commission which says that it cannot hear that appeal unless it is in the public interest that it should hear the appeal. It seems to me to be a bizarre situation when a commissioner may say that in the public interest he will not do something and then to let someone say &#39;I will appeal against that decision&#39; and then to give somebody else power to ask &#39;well, is it sufficiently in the public interest that in the first place the public interest was or was not involved or that that interest was not sufficiently public or not of sufficient interest to the public that an appeal should lie? It appears that there are 2 different meanings given to the words &#39;public interest&#39; in that sense. I am confused. I seek some assistance from the Minister on this matter. </para>
        <para>The other question I put to the Minister relates to appeals. There may well be some other clause in this lengthy Bill which I have missed but as I have read the Bill and in particular proposed new section 35 which deals with appeals the Bill gives to the parties the right of appeal in respect of a decision by a commissioner who will not certify a memorandum because it is not in the public interest. Paragraph (b) (ii) of sub-section (4.) says that an appeal may be made by a party to the agreement in the case of an appeal under paragraph (b) of the sub-section, which is the paragraph which refers to a decision of a commissioner not to certify a memorandum because it is not in the public interest. Does it follow that where 2 representative interests - employer and employee - who have struck a bargain, who have reached an agreement and have had someone else, either a commissioner or some outside intervener, come along and say that it is not in the public interest that these people should be allowed to give expression to their agreement, the right of appeal should be restricted to one of the parties? Is that what this Government is seeking to achieve? If it is, that too is bizarre. Is this Government saying that in the case of people who have struck a bargain and who have been stopped from implementing it or stopped from giving effect to it because of a commissioner&#39;s decision that it is not in the public interest, one &#176;f the people who was a party to the agreement and who now has no dispute with the other shall appeal? Is that what the Minister is trying to say? 1 ask the Minister those 2 questions. There may be something in the Bill which I have missed but I have been looking at the Bill for some time and I cannot see an answer to my queries. </para>
        <para>May 1 put this to the Minister? In his second reading speech the Minister said that the Bill was intended to overcome industrial unrest. How will it overcome the problem of industrial unrest to create machinery like this where people who have reached agreements find that the Minister allows someone else to intervene and say: &#34;The agreement is not in the public interest; the parties shall remain in dispute; we do not care what happens; you will continue your dispute.&#39;? </para>

          <para>- These proposed new sections now under discussion, irrespective of what Government supporters say, are nothing more than wage freeze provisions. The Minister is on record as having recently referred to women in the work force as being insignificant. He knows as well as his Government knows that there is going to be a greater percentage of females employed in future. He knows that if anybody wants to attain an acceptable standard of living and a decent quality of life, disregarding the monetary factor for the moment and the number of persons in a family who have become earners or working units, the only way in which young people in a community can afford to overcome the 1,000 per cent increase in the cost of land in many of our cities and suburbs throughout the nation is for both of them to contract to work. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Let us deal with the term &#39;the public interest&#39;. I have heard no cry from this Government nor has anybody else in the Parliament against the 22 per cent price increase by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd for its steel products in just 12 short months. If this Government wants to define the public interest&#39; so far as industrial disputes are concerned and so far as wages are concerned, if it wants a plain honest definition and not one from the group of eggheads to which the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> referred earlier, just assess the fact that wage and salary earners and their dependants in this country represent in excess of 90 per cent of the people. Is that not right? We heard the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> say that you should not grant a wage increase to this sector, or to bring it down to a lesser number, the people employed in the automotive industry, numbering about 30,000 and those employed in support industries again numbering about 30,000, because overall they are getting too much. But when it comes to 57 tall poppies in the Public Service and they are given $250,000 to share, that is all right. That is in the public interest says the honourable member for Denison. He is evidently of the opinion that he will get knocked off at the next election, to use his own term, when he will want to go back as an employee of the University of Tasmania. He wants to protect his own personal interest. That is the way that a lot of people would look at it in their own areas. What is &#39;the public interest&#39; in an exercise like this? No doubt it is some after-thought of the Government. </para>
        <para>The proposed new sections under discussion constitute a direct wage freeze - they will limit wages and conditions of work. If we take the Commonwealth as being the protectors of the public interest, God help the public because in this Bill there is mention of annual leave and long service leave. The Commonwealth Government has not seen fit to increase annual leave for its employees - and I can see the honourable member for Moreton anticipating what I am going to say - since Federation or in 72 years. So if anybody considers that a member of the public can expect to get some benefit from this Government he had better think again. </para>
        <para>I want to say something about the rights of people to negotiate and the rights of people to agree. I want to draw attention to statements made by the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> in regard to waterside workers&#39; agreement. I should like the honourable member to tell me where, as a result of wage increases, freight rates have increased. I should like him to relate those to the tremendous freight increases that have occurred when there has been no movement in the wage sector at all, either at sea or ashore, and little movement in costs for wharfage and so on. He might be able to convince me but I do not think he will. He will see that freight increases do not necessarily follow wage increases. If production is the key factor miners ought to be getting 5 times their present wages on the production figures given to us by the honourable member for Cunningham today. If there are only one-fifth the number of miners employed in coal mines today as compared with 15 or 20 years ago, and they are producing 10 times as much coal, assessing it on the basis of productivity why should they not receive more pay? The Government does not want that. </para>
        <para>Government supporters, especially legal eagles, have never supported wage increases or improvements in conditions. They merely carry out their function by voting for the matter before the House to restrict those benefits. If the Minister were to cast his mind back to the system that operated in relation to the gigantic undertaking just south of the Australian Capital Territory, the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, he would recall that that scheme existed for the whole of its life on the basis of negotiation and not necessarily on the basis that the parties were directed to accept the decision of a panel of judges who are quite removed from the industrial scene and have no contact with it whatever. </para>
        <para>I should like the Minister to tell us when the Pull Bench of the Commission took it upon itself to have a really close look at what is happening in industry today. I should like the Commission to look at the broad spectrum of industry and at the provision of the Bill that says it will have direct control over the remuneration of wage and salary earners in this country. Will the judges take into consideration reports such as we have seen in the past 48 hours from the University of Melbourne in regard to poverty in Australia as it affects wage earners in the community and people who live below the poverty line? Will the judges of this country inspect those conditions before arriving at a decision that might be fair and in the public interest? Of course not, and the Minister knows they will not. So, why is this legislation before the House? ls it to appease a minority party in the Senate? ls it to buy preference votes? </para>
        <para>I might ask: Is it in the public interest for us to have the conflict we have seen in the past 48 hours between the coalition parties - the Country Party and the Liberal Party - before a particular report on the wool industry becomes available? ls this not merely petty party politics? Government supporters are concerned only that they should be re-elected every 3 years. They do not give a damn about proper and responsible government. Is it in the public interest that during the recess uranium deposits to our north will be signed away to foreign interests? Do Government supporters think that someone should ask these questions and be entitled to a proper answer? Of course not. It does not come within the Government&#39;s realm of narrow, overshadowed party politics. Is it in the public interest that in the past 2 days 5 Ministers have attacked a decision of one of the members of the front bench? Is the Government concerned about that? Was it in the public interest that the Government squandered $500m on the Fill aeroplanes? Has anyone asked that question? </para>
        <para>Is it in the public interest that young married men who have been forced into the Army must live in the fringe areas of various cities because adequate and proper housing is not provided for them? All the issues which the Government, with its narrow political point of view, believes to be in the public interest are contained, though hidden, in the clauses of this Bill which will give extremely wide powers to a group of people whom 1 consider have never been in touch with the public other than on the university campus in their younger days when they were studying law. I oppo.se the Bill on that basis. I do not think it is reasonable or necessary. If time would permit 1 would quote to the Minister many of the statements he has made to his own political party and coming from his own secretariat in the past few weeks and just prior to Christmas. It would not make any difference whether this Bill is carried or not. I have no doubt it will be because it will be merely a numbers game. </para>

          <para>- We have gone from the actual needs of the community to what industry can afford to pay. In this clause who will determine what is the public interest? What section of the public will take the dominant role in determining the sectional interest? It has been said that a functional point in public interest is to protect the weak against the strong, the strongest in this case being the employers and the Government. We are in this Bill establishing the basis of revolt against the arbitration system, for it establishes a system whereby wages will be frozen at governmental will, making the wages struggle even more the part of politics than it Ls now. But before the revolt occurs, out of sheer frustration at their inability to establish procedures satisfactory to the mass, a lot of workers&#39; money will have been spent in taking points of dispute to courts in an attempt to dissolve and to challenge the meaning and intent of clauses in this Bill. This will do nothing for industrial peace. But on the performance of the Government, if of course the public continues to tolerate it and leave it in power, this Government will again legislate to change the situation to suit that of the employers at any particular point of time. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Who are the employers which this legislation is aimed to assist? In the main they are overseas based companies, shipping and cargo handling companies and investment, companies whose profits have been enormous and will continue to increase in what will become a comparatively wage controlled area with no control on profit margins. This legislation should be establishing a basis of conciliation, not arbitral dictation, which it does. In fact, it brings about a situation in which, by a low wage structure based on &#39;public interest&#39; objections, or lengthened hours in the &#39;public interest&#34; in industries such as the Public Service, public transport, hospitals and other essential service industries, this plea will be used to subsidise industry, to control the wage cost structure, to escape the cost to the Government or, as they would say, restrict the cost to the community, the taxpayer, but in so doing we create another section in the poverty area. Strangely enough to work in essential government or semigovernment services has always meant and still does mean a low wage structure. In fact the minimum wage with small margins is more the rule than the exception in that area. The over award payment is usually obtained from the high profit industries. </para>

            <para>-  Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were speaking about public interest and the effect of over award payments which had been given to those industries which could afford them, quite often for very good reasons such as lack of safety or uncomfortable or insecure working conditions. Because of this the Government has typically over-reacted in the matter and has become carried away by its own propaganda. But let us look at the public interest. I say that it might well be in the public interest to withdraw this legislation, if we are looking at it from one viewpoint of public interest. Let us look at the pastoral award, under which the wage for a worker is $42.50 a week. Yet if a pastoral worker who has a wife and 2 children stops work and goes on to unemployment benefits, he receives $43 a week, a gain of 50c. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>If the Department were doing its job, the anomalies would be pointed out to the Minister, and no doubt he would rectify the situation. But how will this Bill be applied when this area comes under scrutiny and the pastoralists plead poverty stemming from the effects of Government mismanagement which is being felt by all pastoralists? Indeed they have said that. Now that they are losing the assistance of the low wage structure for Aboriginal workers, who should be paid an adequate pastoral award wage but who are not receiving one yet, what has the Minister done to enforce the award payments in this area? What prosecutions and enforcements have taken place? Will he say that it is not in the public interest to act? What happens when the Minister relinquishes his portfolio and another interpretation is placed on the meaning of the section by another Minister who may decide, for instance, that it is in the public interest to refuse all wage increases. That could well be the view of a future Minister. 1 say another Minister&#39; because this Minister is supporting an increase for commissioners of $4,000 a year, retrospective to when that increase was refused by the Parliament, so he is in part supporting increases for the upper levels but not for the actual productive worker. </para>
        <para>The public interest is in effect a sectional interest decided on by who is in power. It is a sectional viewpoint that does not have the benefit of a majority decision by referendum or vote of any sort. It will be determined by the educational and financial background of the person deciding it. It does nothing for the individual worker or his dependants who are directly affected by the decision which is made against what may have been proven to be a just claim in every other way. On the evidence submitted a claim could be completely proven in every aspect, but the allowance of the concept of outside or public interest could then lead to the suppression of the claim. The Minister might say: &#39;If these people are not satisfied in that employment, let them find some other avenue by which to earn a living or, in the extreme, go on unemployment benefits.&#39; We all know that the old concept of the Australian home with the wife always there to rear the family in dignity and comfort on the one adequate wage is a thing of the past. Today, to have any standard at all, both husband and wife must work. This has happened only during the last 23 years of Liberal Government rule. By wage freezing and hours freezing, which are the intent of this legislation, the situation will be perpetuated - so much so that until some governmental action is taken to make the family unit what it was, what people fought and died for in 2 world wars - the fundamental bastion of our society - the family will become embroiled in some of the most bitter industrial disputes just to obtain enough income to suffice in our modern community. Even in a man&#39;s unemployment benefit the family unit is means tested on the earnings of the wife. </para>
        <para>We urgently need new thinking and a new approach to wage fixing and fringe entitlements and costs borne by the worker on the lower income scale if we are to have industrial peace. Justice not only needs to be done but needs to be done in such a way that every man, and woman in the community at large understands what is being done. Where else in the field cf human relations can one find so much legislative mumbo-jumbo and impediment to human understanding and friendship as is placed in the hands of people who create a career out of what has become the industrial battlefield. This clause increases the legal ammunition which must be paid for by the community in disputes of a technical nature. I would be more impressed, as I feel the community would be, if no profit whatsoever were to be made in the taking of industrial cases by those who have a vested interest in causing the dispute and subsequent delay in payment of the wage increases. If the legislation lessened the possibility of litigation by making payments retrospective to the date of application, with an over-riding interest payment on the money withheld for that period, we would be able to say that some genuine attempt was being made to speed up finalisation of disputes and the avoidance of them. But to continue in the manner in which we are proceeding is a farce. </para>
        <para>I appreciate that the Minister admits his inability to bring in adequate price control legislation. The Government says that it is beyond its ability to legislate in an adequate manner to control prices and profits, and I concede its failure. On the other hand, what gives the Government the temerity to imagine that it can be any more successful with industrial legislation which is in effect a price and production control. Of course, this legislation is doomed to failure. If the Government wants success in the field of industrial legislation, it will need to make imaginative new departures such as the setting up of an all party committee so that it can at least obtain some basic understanding of the problems and not rely entirely on its preconceived ideas to legislate. But any legislation which in itself allows outside intervention of a third party, after the 2 parties directly concerned have agreed, to change that decision in the interests of other people, sets dangerous precedents - precedents which other people will see and use at a later stage much to the discomfort of the existing government. It is not too late for rational thinking and the withdrawal of this legislation in the public interest to take place. </para>

          <para>- I want to amplify the comments I made before dinner with regard to a number of matters. In particular, it is quite clear that the Government is systematically trying to unload onto the arbitration system as a sort of economic whipping boy the responsibilities for its own sins of economic commission and omission. The Government has shown a consistent incapacity to deal with inflation, but it has chosen in particular to try to off-load the full responsibility on to the wages system. The catchcry is raised - it is almost like some witch&#39;s chorus - that in all cases it is a matter of wages being raised first and then prices following. The position is exactly the opposite. </para>

            <para>- The position is exactly the opposite - the interjection notwithstanding - because with the system of delays  and frustrations that are inherent in the present over-legalised system of arbitration it follows that automatically it is not possible for wages to do other than follow prices. This myth has been sedulously cultivated and the Government in political terms stands or falls by it. Hence it is determined at all costs to assume complete control of the arbitration system and in so doing, as I said earlier, it will destroy it. On the question of the submissions that are made by the Government, I want to quote from an address given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Hince,  who is a senior lecturer in economics at the Melbourne University. His remarks have been published by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. They are vital in considering the question of public interest. He said: </para>

          <para>The Government intervenes in the &#39;public interest&#39; and presents material and argument in  a  brief prepared within government departments and presented by legal counsel. The presentation of material in open court, with the publicity which surrounds national wage cases, has apparently caused some considerable concern for the Government in recent years. In the 1960 hearing the Commonwealth brief did state reasonably categorically, with detailed reasons that no wage increase should be granted. Subsequently, many commentators linked this categoric assertion of the Commonwealth view on wage increases to the near defeat of the Government in the following elections. Whether this view is correct or not, it is noticeable that the Government brief in subsequent national wage cases has been less assertive and limited, in the main, to presenting general information and statistical material relating to the state of the economy. The Commonwealth has refrained from making positive submissions about the quantum of wage increases which it considers the Commission should award. </para>
          <para>The adoption of this position by the Commonwealth reached, in my opinion, the limits of absurdity in the 1966 hearing. In this case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerr,</inline> Q.C., appearing as Senior Counsel for the Commonwealth, indicated that they, the Commonwealth, favoured a moderate increase in wages, but declined to elaborate on what was meant by moderate wage increases. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Wright, presiding at the hearing, made rather pointed comments about the adoption of this particular tactic by the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Wright suggested that this type of submission, in effect, placed the full onus on the Commission to fit in with Government economic policy with regard to prices, productivity and wages, without the Commission being privy to Government thinking about the desirable level of wage increases. In this judgment, which was part of the majority judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Wright said: </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth shrank from the tasks of estimation, contenting itself with a suggestion for  a  &#39;moderate&#39; increase but counselling against  a  &#39;large&#39; increase; such suggestions are just meaningless to one who is under an obligation to reduce his reasoning to terms of currency. </para>
          <para>However, the Commonwealth has continued to follow the pattern which emerged after the 1960 hearing. In the 1968 &#39;National Wage Case&#39; hearing, the Commonwealth ignored the stricture of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Wright and suggested that Government policy favoured a small but not a moderate or large increase. </para>

        <para class="block">This book was published in November 1969. That tactic has been continued and it will be intensified. We will have the spectacle of the Government striding into court - in much the same way as King Charles I, 3 centuries ago, strode into the House of Commons - saying: &#39;This is what we want.&#39; The resentment that will be built up then will make an undoubted contribution to industrial hatred and turmoil for generations. In quite another field I want to refer to the impact of tertiary industry on industrial productivity. I quote from an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> M. Fitzgerald published in the &#39;Nation&#39; on 13th November 1971. He had this to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The disturbing elements in the last Consumer Price Index were not due to increases in manufacturing prices but in tertiary-sector items - in fact, Government charges, especially transport and hospitals . . . The tertiary sector is the growing one in our economy and with the decline of rural employment it is on the way towards absorbing two-thirds of the work force. (Within this sector, the split is roughly sixty private employment to forty government employment, so that the absolute numbers of privately employed in the tertiary sector is about SO per cent greater than the number of manufacturing employees.) . . . But it seems that our economic thinking and policy-making have failed to catch up with the realities of the new pattern of activity and to draw inferences from it. To quote a phrase of some economists, the tertiary services are by nature &#39;unprogressive&#39;, in the sense that their performance in productivity growth seems generally to be low by comparison with manufacturing (measurement is difficult). </para>

        <para class="block">That is the very thing the Government seizes on to speak in terms of a drop in productivity. That is the very principle that the Government chooses to enshrine in the proposed section 31. This Government is fundamentally dishonest in its whole approach to the matter of wage fixation. Irrespective of its future inability for the remainder of its term in office, it is determined at all costs not merely to freeze wages but also to keep wages lagging further behind than ever. Inflation is starting to gallop. This Government is prepared, between now and polling day, to attempt to buy its way with political offers of electoral largesse. In the process of so doing it will make a further contribution  to the inflation which it is unable to control. The proposed section is dishonest. It is the major section. It is the most vital one and it is the most obnoxious one in the whole of this legislation. It is one that we will oppose here not only in this Parliament but also on the hustings. </para>

            <para>- Hear, hear! If Opposition members wish to bring into this debate some reference to a wages policy and a prices policy I will be very happy to accommodate them at the appropriate time by giving some views on the difference between what they call a minimum wage and what 1 call a maximum price. Any honourable member opposite who happens to have lived during the last war - not many of them would have done so - would have understood what the Labor government did to this country when it had price fixing. Price fixing meant either that something went under the counter or that the sheen was taken off it and people received very poor quality. I hope and pray that this will never happen in this country again. 1 know that the Opposition will not agree to this, but if we are going to have price fixing we will insist that we maintain &#39;.he standards which Australian industry heeds to be able to compete with the rest of the world; we will maintain our standards of quality but the worker will put in a full day&#39;s work occasionally and will see to it that we get the quality we need so that we can compete; and we will charge for that a reasonable amount to cover the profit of the people who are concerned in it. Nobody on this side of the chamber wants excessive profits for anybody. AH we want to do is maintain industry in a stable state so that it will give employment to people who Opposition members say they represent, although half the time they do not really represent them at all because they are encouraging them to go out of work and not receive wages. This is a completely ridiculous situation. I would like to adapt the words of the honourable member for Cunningham and say that this is a dishonest approach to the whole matter. </para>

        <para>We on this side of the House believe in full employment for all of the people all of the time. The proposed new sections of the clause under discussion deal with whether conciliation commissioners are to refer to the Full Bench, if I might put it that way, matters concerning the public interest. Of course it is in the public interest to get the most that we possibly can out of industry. I have been spurred into entering this debate simply to correct the record and say that the honourable member for Cunningham is wrong in insinuating that the approach of this Government is dishonest. If anything, the position is the reverse. </para>

          <para>- Although I have spoken on this matter there is still one matter which concerns me and which I would like the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> to spell out. Both last week and today we have covered a broad area of industrial relations as the Government sees them. In examining the proposed new sections now before the Committee one finds such references as the national economy and the public interest, with which 1 dealt to some extent before the suspension of the sitting. Mention also has been made of standard hours and conditions and these are subjects which appear in some of the proposed new sections under discussion. I would like to refer to the expressed desire of the Government to hand over to the Commission the agreements that are made between consenting parties on an industrial basis concerning unions and employers on the one hand or a group of unions and a group of employers on the other. The Minister no doubt would be aware of this because of his direct reference to it when answering questions in this House in the last 2 weeks. I refer to the agreement between certain waterfront unions and shipowners. I want to refer to provisions in that agreement such as retiring and pension benefits. I suppose that one can relate this to some other industrial organisations which have agreements in regard to pension schemes at both State and semigovernment levels. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I read the proposed new sections under discussion there is nothing that does not indicate that the Government per medium of the Bench cannot have these conditions interfered with. I notice that the Minister is going through the document which I have been referring to for some considerable time and which I have told him before I could quote from. However, I will not take up the time of the House to do so. This legislation is limited now to some extent by the provisions of the Social Services Act. I want to know whether the Minister during the course of the passage of this Bill through the Committee stage can assure the House and industrial organisations, be they white collar or blue collar in character, at this point of time that there will be non-interference with certain conditions which have been arrived at by way of agreement and which deal with social matters. I refer to sick pay and in some certain areas medical benefits. It is not beyond the realm of possibility - in fact it has been mentioned before - that the trade unions will seek to have an agreement between themselves and a particular employer on medical benefits, travel concessions and, as I have already mentioned, retiring allowances. Mention has been made of including even educational benefits such as scholarships within the framework of industrial agreements. Already we have, of course, a wide variety of industrial organisations within the Commonwealth becoming increasingly concerned with credit. Perhaps I may just digress for a short time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> if you will permit me; it is not very often I get any great latitude from the Chair, and I say that with all due respect. But the fact is that there is a danger in this Bill, as I see it, of all those things being interfered with. I think that a responsible Minister would rise and dispute what I am saying. He would say: That is not the intention of the Government&#39;. If it is then not the intention of the Government, surely this Bill has to be more specific because one always has a suspicion that the Full Bench will endeavour to deal with matters perhaps beyond its ambit or its terms of reference, as it were. In addition, of course, there are other areas of concern. One that comes to mind is that this Government in a Bill which came before this House some 2 years ago saw fit to apply a different standard, if I may use that term, to credit unions than applied to other financial organisations. It did this in an attempt to protect the people whom honourable members opposite represent more than others. It was an attempt to protect that area which has been guarded and jealously looked after since 1951, if my memory serves me correctly, fringe banking institutions, which would have been endangered if credit unions had been included in that legislation. </para>
        <para>I would also like to make some reference to the fact that once again on an election eve we have an industrial Bill before the House. I have a suspicion that this has been done by design, that this industrial legislation has been brought before the House on the eve of an election to meet the particular narrow thinking of the Government. I would like to go back to the question of public interest because a lot has been said about it. The thought occurred to me during the suspension of the sitting for dinner that we have a 13-man Cabinet in this place. However, if the Government is concerned about people being represented adequately and properly and is concerned about the public interest, why the devil does it not have representation in Cabinet for each of the States? The Minister for Labour and National Service can take interest now. As I understand it the Cabinet does not have any representative from Tasmania, Western Australia or South Australia. It is true that these States are represented in the Ministry. But clearly, those States do not have Cabinet representation, as distinct from Ministry representation. So we can say that Cabinet - and I notice that the Minister is shaking his head - cannot take into consideration the matter of public interest in the 3 States which I have mentioned. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, the point I want to make is whether the Minister made his recommendations to the Cabinet or whether he made them to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> I want to know whether the Minister decided not to go along with this measure that is now before the House until he was over-persuaded by the Prime Minister in an attempt to stand over a number of Ministers and get the type of policy going that he thought would fit the occasion. Did the Minister pay any regard at all to what the Constitutional Review Committee had to say? The Committee covered a very wide area in 1959-61 at a cost to the taxpayer of possibly Sim. Much today has been said about the public interest I would have though that had the Minister or his ministerial colleauges given some real and proper thought and understanding they would at least have made some reference to the report of that Committee. I can see nothing in this Bill that deals with industrial relations or anything which comes anywhere near expressing any concern or providing protection for individual employees so far as automation is concerned. I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to page 107, clauses 781 and 782 of the report of the Constitutional Review Committee of 1959. </para>
        <para>What is in this Bill for industrial relations? Are we going to have a situation that is not covered by this Bill, other than by pains and penalty, similar to that which occurred in the La Trobe Valley earlier this year where people played petty politics in an industrial dispute? I can foresee grave industrial problems. To illustrate one, let me mention the automotive industry which employs 25,000 to 30,000 people and an equal number in support industries. If the automotive companies decided to shift their operations from Australia to the Philippines or completely to automate what would happen to about 200,000 people, taking into consideration wives and other dependants of their employees? The Government has no express plan. It says that it has a retraining plan but this is completely out of tune with this type of problem. There is nothing in this measure which would help. Here we are in 1972 with a Government saying that it has a plan for industrial relations which, if it does not completely ignore the problem, at least overlooks it. I cannot believe for the life of me that one can stand in the national Parliament of this country in 1972 and be told that this Government, after all the expert opinion it has sought from overseas, has not seen fit to mention one word about these facts that I have mentioned. </para>

          <para>- I do not want to upset the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> but I am bound to say that the only thing upon which I can congratulate him is the fact that he has alerted the Committee to the knowledge that this is 1972. Apart from that there was very little else that the honourable gentleman said that seemed to me to be in point. Since this Committee started to debate what I have described as a very technical and difficult measure I have sought to press upon the Committee one fact and that is that in consideration of the term &#39;public interest&#39; we are dealing with one of the most elusive terms known to the law. </para>

            <para>-  I am delighted to have the honourable gentleman&#39;s confirmation that he agrees with me but, having got it, I am bewildered as to why he has been so reluctant to agree with me openly. Public interest is not something which is susceptible to definition by way of political slogan. There is no shibboleth available to describe public interest. What I have tried to impress upon the Committee though regrettably, I admit, with some measure of failure on both sides, is that public interest is not something that lends itself to definition. That is why I have sought - I would hope with a tolerable measure of self effacement - to contend that it is the lawyer who at least has the discipline of training to reach out, grasp and say what are the elements today that make up public interest. </para>

        <para>I can recall 8 years ago when the Trade Practices Act, or what passed for a Trade Practices Act, went through this Parliament. It referred to public interest and whenever there was some suggestion of an infringement of public interest some honourable members, the &#39;hands up&#39; boys, were all in favour of protecting it. On that occasion I argued that public interest rests for its determination upon the body before which it is placed for adjudication. Here we are placed in what I have described as an intolerable situation. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> is a man of immense goodwill and great indulgence in listening to argument on this point. Under proposed new section 28 there will be a layman, a conciliation commissioner, making the decision on what is public interest. </para>

This is the difference.

        <para class="block">Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> - I must give him a commercial on these matters - took me back to the corn laws when dealing with this subject. I was not arguing this but I was arguing that there is a corporate responsibility in the community which must be acknowledged, heeded and taken into account whenever any decisions are made. I press the matter no further. I am much on the honourable member&#39;s side in saying that whenever there is an opportunity for people&#39;s wages and salaries to be increased in terms of the community&#39;s capacity to pay he will hear no complaint from me. </para>
        <para>I come now to this point of public interest to which I wish to direct the Minister&#39;s attention in particular. Under proposed new section 28 if the conciliation commissioner takes the view that the public interest is involved, he says: &#39;I will refer this matter to the full bench.&#39; It is a question of characterisation. If on the other hand the conciliation commissioner says: The consent order with which I am dealing does not involve public interest&#39;, when in fact it does, who can take it before the full bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? The Minister in his speech in December last year said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Government intends to provide that  a  full bench of the Commission must review  a  conciliated award or order it the Commonwealth refers an award or order on the issue of public interest. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I have heard the honourable member for Hindmarsh say repeatedly: &#34;The AttorneyGeneral on behalf of the Commonwealth can intervene before the full bench&#39;. This simply is not true. The Attorney-General, as I read section 36 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its proposed amendments, can intervene only when the matter is before the full bench. He cannot intervene otherwise. The only way in which the full bench of the Commission can deal with any matter is spelled out in proposed new section 31 of the Act. 1 ask the Minister: What if 2 parties agree to a consent award - take the case I cited this afternoon of the glass workers award - and both parties agree under whatever the circumstances may have been and the conciliation commissioners - and this is no reflection upon those who serve or will serve in that capacity - take the view that the public interest is not involved when in fact it is? The honourable member for Burke may say: &#39;My understanding is that the public interest is involved. How does the Government get it before the full bench?&#39; In my view the Attorney-General can intervene only if the matter is before the full bench. I do not know whether that is a gap in the legislation. I do not take the slightest exception to hard argument. I have heard it whispered around the corridors by way of dull rumour that I indulge in it occasionally myself. If this is a deliberate decision by the Government to say: &#39;We have abandoned the view that the the full Commission should have control over all matters&#39;, so be it. I will not sit down and sob for a week; I have other things in mind. What I suggest to the Minister is that he can take these steps. The conciliation commissioner may make an award under section 28 and gives a certificate. I am sorry to spell it out with such staccato; perhaps \ might be granted a brief extension of time if I run out. The Commissioner certifies that he believes that the public interest is in no way involved, so the matter does not come before the Full Bench. Indeed, the Full Bench may never hear of it. The power under section 36 (1.) to intervene is available only when the matter is before the Full Bench. If the commissioner failed to refer or the Full Bench failed to apprehend and seize jurisdiction, the matter could go by without further action. </para>
        <para>I suggest to the Minister that there should be in proposed section 35 a provision to this effect. The Full Bench shall have power to determine that a matter dealt with under section 28 of this Act is a matter exercisable by a Full Bench and not otherwise. I am sorry to have laboured the matter before the Committee, but I believe that this is a gap. Public interest is a matter which should be controllable in its broad sense by the Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission. </para>

          <para>- I rise to take part in this debate again only because of the continued reference to me by my honourable and, I must add. learned friend, the esteemed honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> It seems to me that all these clauses that we now are discussing come down to a matter of public interest. Twice today I have heard my very learned friend from Moreton endeavour to explain to this House how he justified the Government taking action in the public interest, yet he &#39;has not done so. On 2 occasions he has risen to speak. He quoted case histories. By interjection he admitted that one cannot establish this rather vague public interest. Yet, he will support the Government and he will support the Minister in writing this principle into the Act. </para>

            <para>- As my colleague the honourable member for Stirling interjected, it is an act of God. Surely it is in the same category. It seems that anything that does not please the Government comes into the category of not being in the public interest. It seems to me to be as simple as that. I do not have the benefit of a degree at law. I have never been called to the Bar. I have never wore the silk. I remember the honourable member for Moreton saying that when it comes to a question of determining that which is in the public interest, only lawyers can do it properly. </para>

            <para>- As I said earlier today, and I repeat the statement, I think that lawyers have a vested interest in starting disputes and a further vested interest in prolonging them. I think the public of Australia should reject the suggestion - the honourable member for Moreton went further than suggesting it - that only lawyers have some sort of prerogative in determining that which is in the public interest. </para>

        <para>In the debate on this Bill last Thursday, I made the comment that there was no mystique about lawyers, other than the mystique that they created about themselves. Surely the question that we are considering is the question that confronts working people in this country - the problems between them and their employers. I think that this country has reached a pretty sorry state when a government of the political colour of the Government that sits opposite us in this House goes into the court, makes reference to matters that affect working people and those who employ them, and casts its political judgments upon something that surely is divorced from politics. Yet the honourable member for Moreton says that this is the way things should be. I apologise for repeating myself, but I do not think that the settlement of disputes takes place in the clinical atmosphere of a court. </para>
        <para>The provisions that the Government intends to write into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act revolve around the notorious section 28 of the parent Act. That was never a good provision. Nobody from the trade union movement ever agreed that section 28 was of any value, yet the Government now. in a blatant attempt at union bashing, proposes to introduce to that bad section of the parent Act provisions which do not improve the Act at all but in fact make it worse. All this was raised earlier. 1 appreciate that the hour is getting late and 1 know that other honourable members have many things to say on this point. 1 compliment my colleagues on this side of the House who have made very valuable contributions to this debate. This matter is of importance to a large section of the community. We must be reminded that there are 4.5 million people in this country who work to produce the goods and provide the services that are required by the rest of the community. </para>

            <para>- No. I do not think the rest of them are lawyers. Some of them are school teachers and others have all sorts of other jobs. But that 4.5 million people - I am speaking now of the male working population - have wives and children who are dependent upon them. Therefore, I would presume we are speaking of something like 9 million people out of a total population of 13 million people. It seems to me, and I have yet to be persuaded away from this argument, that anything that is in the best interests of those 9 million people surely is in the public interest. Is that not what we are talking about? Has the honourable member for Moreton not tried to persuade us that it should be a small minority - the 66 men of this great nation who sit on the other side of the House - that represents the public interest? The Government&#39;s ideas of public interest are the interests of the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packers and companies such as Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and other organisations which the Government represents. I can assure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> and every honourable member who sits on the other side of the chamber, that that is not my idea of public interest. My idea of public interest is that which affects the people who live in my electorate and in the electorates of other honourable members. As I have explained, these are the people who work and provide the goods and services for the rest of the community. That is the public interest. I support anything that is in their best interests. </para>

I will support anything that I believe to be in their best interests and, as far as 1 am concerned, the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packers, the <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansetts and those other mighty captains of industry of this country can go hang.

          <para>- I am sure that the electorate of Burke is impassioned by the speech which has just been delivered, but I think that the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> underestimates the intelligence of the members of his electorate. If he believes what he has just said, when he talked about the 9 million people and about the 4.5 million people he would realise that they are the public interest about which we are talking. The honourable members remarks sounded incredible to me. The honourable member made a lot of verbiage flow. He talked about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer, the capitalists and everything else, but what else is the Government trying to protect except the 4.5 million workers, of whatever class they may be, and the 9 million people, of whatever class they may be. This debate has become a complete farce to listen to, because one hears a parrot cry from honourable members on the other side of the House, as if they had been wound up. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Honourable members opposite are not talking to the Parliament; they are talking to Joe and Bob at the Australian Council of Trade Unions. They are saying, in effect: &#39;I am here Bob. I am putting it out. Look, the verbiage is flowing&#39;. </para>
        <para>However, let us refer back to the dispute which occurred recently in the Victorian State Electricity Commission. This has been referred to already. Was it regarded by the honourable member&#39;s supporters in Burke as being in the public interest that, by the stupidity of one section of industry, they were put out of business and out of employment, and that they had their industries closed down because they could not operate. Was that considered to be in the public interest? I must admit that the honourable member&#39;s voice was strangely silent at that time. </para>
        <para>Is it considered to be in the public interest if some stupid arrangement is manipulated for the advantage of only one section of the community, with perhaps a selfish employer who is prepared to take advantage of the situation for his own good but to the detriment of the country and of other people in other industries? Is that in the public interest? Is that not what we are discussing now? Anyone who listened last night to what the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> said the Labor Party, if it ever gets into power, will do in the public interest, and considers that in association with what the Labor Party regards as being in the public interest, would say that it gives the public and the workers of this country room for a great deal of thought. It is fine for honourable members opposite to stand up in this chamber and whip off the verbiage. The honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> talked about price freezing. We heard that lugubrious voice going forth to the workers who are throbbing in their homes listening to the great Labor leaders who have led them so gloriously over the last 20 years. Frankly, if the Labor Party does not know what is in the public interest it ought to sort itself out with those whom it claims to represent. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I agree with the point that the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has just made. But before dealing with that point, let me say one other thing about the speech made by the honourable member for Burke. Nowhere is it provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the Government can walk into a court and demand or insist that a decision be made in the public interest. The court has to decide that. What the Opposition is saying is that the Government just tells the court that something is in the public interest or the Government decides that it shall be so. That is absolute rubbish. Recently we saw the Government make an appeal to the court which was rejected. If the court feels that a matter does not involve the public interest, it has a perfect right to say so. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Moreton said that a conciliation commissioner could decide, on what he is told by the 2 parties - the union and the employer - that a matter is not of any interest to the public, and other factors may not be considered. I agree with the honourable member that this matter should be examined. I will wait for the Minister to give an explanation concerning it. The matter may well have been covered; there may well be a point that we have not taken into account. But I trust that the Minister has an explanation which will be satisfactory to the honourable member for Moreton, because it appears to me that there is little occasion to waste an explanation on the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> and the honourable member for Burke because so far they have not understood what one clause of the Bill means. </para>

          <para>- Until this evening I was under the impression that the prime objective of a Conciliation and Arbitration Act was to provide the best possible industrial relations between the work force and the employers of this country. This Bill, particularly in this clause, goes as far as is humanly possible in the opposite direction. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee, but I was intrigued by my friend the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> who based his argument on the. recent dispute which involved the State Electricity Commission in Victoria. The fact is that if this Bill is passed in this form, it will set the scene for similar disputes. Anyone who is aware of what happened in the dispute involving the State Electricity Commission in Victoria knows full well that the dispute continued because the State Government refused to allow the Commission&#39;s officers to negotiate a settlement of the dispute with the employers. That is the fact of the case. The dispute would have been concluded earlier but for the intervention of the Victorian Government which, like the Commonwealth Government, wants to stop negotiation. We cannot have a Conciliation and Arbitration Act that cuts off negotiation and passes the matter over to arbitration before proper discussions between the parties have been concluded. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Tonight we heard the honourble member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> deal with the question of public interest. He is a learned gentleman; he is a lawyer. But I venture to suggest that no-one who heard him tonight had any better idea of what &#39;public interest&#39; meant when he finished than when he started. He confused the issue right along the line. The fundamental basis of industrial relations is negotiation between the parties. They do not want anyone else there What happens if there is a dispute in a large industry? I will give an illustration. I refer to the time when the Victorian Government and, 1 think, the New South Wales Government passed legislation in respect of long service leave. A challenge was taken to the High Court and later to the Privy Council as to whether those governments had the power to pass the legislation. J belonged to an industry which was associated with employers who had part of their work force in New South Wales, part in Victoria and part in South Australia. </para>
        <para>The situation was that Victoria and New South Wales has passed legislation in respect of long service leave, but anyone in those States who had spent many years in the industry and was getting near to the time when he was entitled to long service leave was promptly transferred to South Australia where the long service leave provisions did not apply. We negotiated with the companies concerned, and eventually agreed that if the Privy Council upheld the union&#39;s case that the States&#39; legislation was valid, the companies concerned would apply the same terms and conditions to the people working under exactly the same award in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. What is wrong with that? But that could not be done under the sort of legislation we are considering tonight. We return to the old story that we are dealing with human beings on the employer side and on the union side. When all is said and done, most disputes in recent years have been caused by the intervention of the various governments, such as occurred in the dispute concerning the State Electricity Commission in Victoria. If we leave employers and unions to negotiate their troubles betwen them we will find that we will have better industrial relation concepts in Australia. On world standards industrial relations in Australia are pretty good. At least the Bank of New South Wales thinks that is the case because when it advertises overseas for migrants to come to Austeralia it refers to the great industrial relations set-up in Australia. </para>
        <para>A lot has been said this afternoon and this evening about the question of public interest and the situation on the waterfront where the employers and the unions negotiated an agreement which resulted in reduced working hours and increased wages. My friend the honourable member for Moreton said that more people are involved than the 2 parties to the agreement. On his definition of public interest not only the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers are involved in that agreement; many other people in Australia are involved. He amplified that by saying that the agreement would result in increased freights which would rebound on the Australian public in the way of increased prices. 1 am prepared to say that that is possible. But the fact remains that in recent years, because of improved techniques, the output per waterside worker has increased out of sight. If the argument of the honourable member for Moreton is sound, freights should have decreased some years ago because of the reduced work force and increased productivity. But he is not interested in that; he says that public interest does not come into that. If the Government really wants to perfect an industrial relations concept in Australia, I suggest that it could write the Conciliation and Arbitration Act on the back of an envelope and trust to the goodwill and decency of both sides in the industrial field. </para>

            <para>- My thinking has advanced since then, yours has remained in the 15th century. If ever there was an illustration of the truth of the proposition spoken in the 19th century by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Byles it has been proved in this House tonight because we have heard members on the other side of the House, and I fully respect their views, speaking about the public interest. 1 think of the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> in this context. He said that the public interest is the interest of the people in his electorate, not the interest of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd or of some newspaper proprietor or of this person or that person. Other people might say that the public interest consists of the views of the people in the electorate of Berowra. I do not know. I have a possibly unhealthy, rather odd view that the public interest consists of something much more elusive than that which has sought to be denned tonight by the honourable member for Burke. The public interest in truth is something that basically is undefinable, even by my honourable friend from Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly).</inline> Sometimes the definition of what is in the public interest has to be somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes this Parliament might be thought by a lot of people to be rather arbitrary in its definition, by majority view, of what is in the public interest. What I am trying to say is that the honourable member for Burke cannot have it all his own way. I do not have it all my own way because my views as to what the public interest might demand might appeal to me greatly but they might be totally wrong. They probably are wrong as views of other honourable members are wrong from time to time. </para>

        <para>Unfortunately there are times when the decision as to what constitutes the public interest has to be committed to a body outside this Parliament, to a judicial body or to a conciliation commissioner - to someone who, whatever his human frailty, has cast upon him the responsibility of making a decision. I cannot see how, if human affairs are to be ordered in a responsible way, we can escape from that position. I think that we possibly do ourselves a disservice in talking too much, too widely, and too loosely about the public interest which must always remain one of the most elusive things that politicians, judges or people can ever talk about. </para>

        <para class="block">I draw attention to a point raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> who challenged the Minister at the table to explain the conflict between that proposed new section and proposed new section 35 which states:  (1.) In this section unless the contrary intention appears - (2.) An appeal lies to the Commissioner against - (3.) An appeal does not lie under the last  prededing  sub-section unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, an appeal should lie. </para>
        <para class="block">I ask the Minister to reply to this point during the course of his remarks. I suggest to him that if he had replied earlier it might have shortened this debate considerably. I remember in the early days when I used to appear in court on behalf of the locomotive engine drivers&#39; union. If it was wanted to stop unions from getting something, public interest did not come into it. The employers would say that it was &#39;an act of God&#39;. For instance, if I asked for something for locomotive enginemen who were held up because of a washaway, the washaway was an act of God. If the char had caught alight and a truck or the train had been burned and delayed, the enginemen could not get their just entitlements because it was an act of God. The workers soon woke up to that and wanted to know whose side God was really on. Now we find there is reference mainly to public interest. I suggest to our friends opposite that public interest really depends on what government is in power and what judge or conciliation commissioner happens to be on the bench and what his leanings are. That is the extent to which public interest applies and I think that is what we have to consider on this occasion. </para>
        <para>When I spoke in this debate earlier I started to quote from a very learned gentleman who, in his book &#39;Better Employment Relations&#39; - because of the shortage of time I had the opportunity to say only a few words about him - mentioned public interest. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Obviously the legislators were determined to have every regard for the public interest and, therefore, heed to the desirability of a coordination and consistency in respect of matters significant enough to affect the public interest. Accordingly they were of a mind to insist that the public interest should take precedence, where necessary, over the desire or need of a party for a prompt settlement of the dispute in which it or he is concerned. They make no attempt, however, to indicate even broadly what they mean or understand by &#39;public interest&#39; or to supply criteria or guide material for its ascertainment. There is no denying that a definition of the expression &#39;public interest&#39; is a task or requirement that involves considerable difficulty - a definition in absolute terms, it is safe to say, is impossible and even unwise, seeing that definition must always mean limitation. The term is relative and conditional conceptions of the public interest vary not only from person to person, but according to time and circumstance. Nevertheless the omission is calculated to introduce discrepancies in decisions that have to be taken before references and appeals can come before the Full Court for determination, and, on that account, to cause dissatisfaction. It is regrettable, therefore, that an objective standard of public interest was not in some measure at least made available. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is the sole basis upon which this argument stands. It depends really on the people who are defining public interest and, to repeat what I said earlier, it depends on what government is in office, whether it makes submissions concerning what it thinks it is right for the court of conciliation and arbitration to do and what the judges of the court determine shall be done. So, in the final analysis, it all gets down to politics. 1 suggest that some definition, at least in the broadest sense if not in the narrowest sense, should have been attempted in this Act. I challenge the Minister now to answer the question that was raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. This would, to a large extent, solve this matter. </para>

          <para>-  I rise at this stage to refer to questions raised by the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> and the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> who in their inimitable way have in a most forthright and vigorous fashion looked at .he question of giving the Commonwealth power to seek a review of conciliated awards. This, frankly, is the fundamental matter which both my colleagues have correctly identified as having been one of the initial proposals which was set down in a statement brought down in the House last December. The Government in seeking a response to the many representations which it had received was made very much aware of the strong opposition which existed to this proposal from all of the principal parties, as I recall it without exception. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The views put to the Government, which were views that the Government accepted, were views put on the proposition that such a proposal would in fact run counter to the objectives which we sought to serve; that it would induce the parties to conciliate outside the system, which of course was not the Government&#39;s intention, and to that extent would be counter productive to the whole orientation and emphasis which in part is in the Bill now before us. What we would have seen, had the Commonwealth proceeded with that proposal, would have been parties negotiating fur more agreements outside the system without the Commonwealth having any power whatsoever to affect the matters which would be the subject of such agreements. The general philosophy has been this: We believe in seeking where possible to endeavour to encourage parties to conciliate their differences within the system and certainly in terms of that requirement which involves the public interest. </para>
        <para>I will not deal with that question now for it has been properly identified by speakers on this side and 1 pay particular trfibute to the comments made by my colleague, the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes),</inline> who drew attention to the dangers and the absurdity of seeking to define this term in any concrete sense. The Committee will be aware that part of the proposals in relation to the Bill includethe opportunities for parties who are respondents to the original award and who may not be involved in a wage negotiation which affects that award but who, because of their respondency to the original award to be affected, have the right to appeal to the Commission against that award and secondly on the question of public interest the Commission has power to certify that the matter is not contrary to the public interest. </para>
        <para>So far as the final point queried by the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> is concerned, I simply say this in brevity because of the time factor at this stage of the debate: There is no inconsistency in the provisions of the proposed new section 28, which relates to the certification of an agreement, and the proposed new section 35 which is concerned with whether an appeal should lie. In both cases the public interest is a factor that is taken into account but they are totally different circumstances. </para>
        <para>May I, without any sense of offence to members on either side, remind honourable members on both sides that there was an agreement between the leaders of both parties that this Bill would be the subject of a final vote tonight by the hour of 12 o&#39;clock. I say without offence that we have witnessed tonight - and I put this in the most pleasant possible way that I can - a series of speeches from honourable members who have been content to seek to repeat and restate what has been clearly and amply put before the Committee by other honourable members on their side. Frankly if this trend is to continue - and I put this on the basis that there has been agreement - the Government will have to consider applying the guillotine because the Government is determined that this matter will be the subject of a final vote before the House rises tonight. </para>

          <para>- The proposed new sections 32, 33, 34 and 35 give the Commission power to include in an award a bans clause or a clause relating to procedures for the settlement of disputes. They include also provision that in future it shall be mandatory upon  a  presidential member of the Commission to issue a prosecution certificate upon that certificate being applied for, except where the member is of the opinion that the dispute can be settled promptly without the issue of such a certificate. Of course, if a dispute is already in existence and men are on strike one might say that for all intents and purposes it will in future be mandatory for the prosecution certificate to be issued. When the prosecution certificate has been issued the employer need take only one more step in order to have a fine imposed upon the organisation concerned, as prescribed by section 119 of the Act. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In those awards which contain clauses providing that it shall be an offence upon each individual worker to cease work, the issue of a prosecution certificate will give to the Industrial Court power to impose upon individual workers a maximum penalty of $1,000. Where the provisions of an award treat each day of a dispute as a separate offence the court will have power to impose a maximum penalty of $500 a day upon each employee. The enormity of this is assessed fully when one reflects back to the 1964 General MotorsHolden&#39;s Pty Ltd dispute which involved many thousands of workers and lasted for 15 days. The maximum amount which could have been imposed upon General Motors-Holden&#39;s Pty Ltd on that occasion in the case of a lock-out was $7,500. However, the aggregate amount that could have been imposed upon the workers involved in a strike on that occasion was $2 12m. That is an indication of this Government&#39;s conception of justice. Under these proposed sections the workers would have become liable to pay $2 12m but the employer, the rich overseas conglomerate of General Motors-Holden&#39;s Pty Ltd would be liable to a total of only $7,500. </para>
        <para>A feature of this Bill even worse than those to which I have referred has not yet been touched upon by the Minister. The proposed new sections we are now dealing with give the employer the right to seek  a  prosecution certificate from a judge of the Commission even though that employer has not bothered to notify the Commission of the existence of the dispute. This is something new and has absolutely no justification if one is intending to apply any degree of justice. 1 believe that the existing law made a previously bad law  a  little better, but it is still unacceptable to the trade union movement and ought to be unacceptable to anybody with any regard for the public interest. The former provisions allowed  a  presidential member of the Commission to grant  a  prosecution certificate which would attract to the persons the subject of the certificate the penalties to which I have referred but at least the judge had the right to have regard to the merits of the case. Under the proposed law the presidential member of the Commission will not be able to do that. As the law stands if the judge hearing an application for a prosecution certificate is of the opinion that the employer is at fault he may say that he believes the employer to be the one at fault and therefore has no right to ask for the issue of a certificate to prosecute the employees and for that reason he may refuse the application. However, under the proposed provisions he will not be able to do that. </para>
        <para>I cannot, recall any case where the procedures for settlement of dispute clauses, which were thrashed out by the tripartite conference, have ever been put into an award other than by agreement, and it is right that that should be the position. Although these clauses have never been written into awards other than by agreement, still  a  large number have been written into awards and agreements. It was not generally realised by unions writing into their awards and agreements these procedures for settlement of disputes that the procedures were in fact a bans clause and that anybody in breach of the procedures for settlement of disputes were just as liable to penalties stipulated under section 119 of the Act as they would have been had they been working under an award containing  a  normal bans clause put into that award by the Commission itself. From now on it will be possible for the Commission not only to insert into awards normal bans clauses but also procedures for settlement of disputes which so far have been looked upon as merely voluntary provisions for award inclusion. We must get down to the fundamentals of the right to strike. The Government will say that there is nothing in the law to prohibit the right to strike. However, there is  a  catch. It becomes  an  offence for an employee&#39;s representative or a union representative to incite people to strike or for him to advocate a strike, and is punishable under section 138 of the Act. </para>
        <para>Once a bans clause is put into an award it becomes an offence for an organisation to support a strike. Moreover, it does not matter whether an organisation supports the strike.It becomes liable to a prosecution and a penalty even if the members of the organisation go on strike against the wishes of the management committee of the organisation concerned. So the Government is saying: &#39;We cannot control strikes. The employer cannot prevent them. Now the union officials and the union have to carry the responsibility which we find we cannot carry. So unless you are able to prevent strikes you will be liable to the penalty stipulated in section 119&#39;. </para>
        <para>Nothing could be more unjust than that a union whose members are carrying on a strike against the union&#39;s wishes, a strike which the management committee does not support, should be liable to prosecution and should be punished to the extent that proposed new section 119 entitles the court to impose punishment. This Bill is a most unjust Bill and a most unjust method of carrying out industrial relations. We will never cure industrial unrest by the measures which the Government proposes in this Bill. For 22 years the Government has demonstrated that it cannot control industrial unrest, and it will not do it this time. Until the Government gets down to the cause of industrial unrest we will always have industrial unrest. </para>

            <para>- Impliedly, you did. Even the dullest amongst us - I would be well to the forefront in the honourable member&#39;s opinion - would agree with the view that the Minister was included. We could forget, who would try to forget, who would dare to forget the splendid occasion when the honourable member for Hindmarsh suggested that the one swift, sure, certain way in our miserable existence by which to cure all industrial unrest and disturbance was to fine every striking unionist $20 a day. I have a great deal of sympathy with my honourable friend. He pressed what seemed to me to be a desperately curious argument on that occasion. I went back to Brisbane and spoke to a trade union leader. I have told the Committee and the House that I enjoy - I hope command - the friendship and the acquaintance of many trade union leaders. I have said that I act for them professionally. I am delighted to count them amongst my friends. On this occasion I spoke to one whom, with a measure of utter uncertainty, I would hesitate to describe as being a close confidant of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I am speaking now of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edgar</inline> Williams of the Australian Workers Union. I have had a long association with the AWU, not merely sweeping the floor of a factory, let me assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but sweeping the board in a shearing shed, and indeed on some occasion bathing in the luxuriant waters of the Condamine.I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> - I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> would not regard this as being any infringement of personal conversation - &#39;What do you think about all this?&#39; He said to me with what Kipling would have described as being a webbed and inward turning eye, when I mentioned the honourable member for Hindmarsh- </para>

I also try to be broad-minded, but when I read what was said of the honourable member for Hindmarsh I was embarrassed. Let me inform the Committee of what was said. I am bound to do this, because I cannot imagine the honourable member for Hindmarsh sitting up at night panting with excitement, reading the &#39;Worker&#39;. I want to quote what was said regarding sanctions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> described an Australian Council of Trades Unions meeting in very robust terms.

        <para class="block">Who said that there should be penalties? The honourable member for Hindmarsh did. He said that a $20 penalty should be imposed. Who described it as ludicrous? One of the most distinguished members of the Labor movement in Australia, a person who has an association with the Labor movement stretching back over 40 or 50 years.

        <para class="block">I withdraw from that, as the Committee knows; but I am just trying to point out to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that when it comes to the crunch, when he is placed in the position of assuming a measure of responsibility he is bound to acknowledge the fact that no matter what the merits of the law may be, in order to support it and defend it against infringement and destruction, he must be prepared to have a system of sanctions. I think it was in my speech on the second reading that I pressed upon the House that 1 acknowledged readily the fact that people resile from having a system of punishments. 1 also contended that whenever we have a system of punishments, whenever we have powers which are misused, men will ultimately say: &#39;These are no longer to be dignified as powers. These are burdens and we will not be prepared to shoulder them.&#39; That is why I say to the Government unblushingly - and that is why, if I may, say to those who are called upon to administer this legislation: &#39;You cannot abuse it, because the very moment that you abuse it you bring into being the prospect of its own destruction&#39;. </para>
        <para>May I remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh of what a Labor Government did in 1947 to the then Arbitration Court. It brought that Arbitration Court into existence as a court of superior record. For what purpose? To issue injunctions on any union official who appeared before it and treated with contempt its injunctions. What was the penalty? May I remind the honourable gentleman that memory is a rather imperfect vehicle. Happily, the records are not. On 12th March 1947 in this House the right honourable member for Barton, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> said: </para>

          <para>The Bill retains all the methods provided for in the existing Act for securing the acceptance and the observance of awards. One extreme view, presented by a section only of employers, was that all the penalty clauses which were repealed by the Scullin Government in 1930 should now be restored. This view we have rejected, lt was not put forward by all employers, but by a section of them. Equally we have rejected suggestions that all existing disciplinary powers of the court itself should be eliminated. The existing provisions relating to the deregistration of organisations, the secret ballot under court orders, the cancellation and suspension of awards and the enforcement of sanctions inserted in awards are therefore retained. </para>

            <para>- Well, that is what it was. The honourable member for Moreton swallowed Dickens for tea. Let us get down to the stomach of the Bill. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that the employer has the right under the provisions of this clause of the Bil&#93; to bring on a prosecution before the presidential bench without the presidential bench going into the merits of the case? Is that the position? That is the stomach of this clause. Can I have an acknowledgement from the Minister? Is this the factual position? Let me enlighten the honourable member for Moreton and give him a specific case. It is possibly hypothetical but it certainly could operate in the federal jurisdiction. A foreign owned dredging company in Australia brought out a bucket dredge from Great Britain. How it ever met Board of Trade requirements in the United Kingdom I will never know. A private agreement was struck between the company and the union. It reached the stage where it finished its area of operations and was due to go to a port in New South Wales tor tie up and survey. The men wanted extra money to take the vessel from point A to point B. The company refused point blank to negotiate with the employees concerned and insisted on union representation. The union officials found when they arrived on the ship that it was unseaworthy. In my view, it would never have complied with Commonwealth or State Marine Acts. Let us imagine that the men refused to take the vessel to sea. Am I to understand and assume that under the proposed section an employer could go straight to the presidential bench and ask for a prosecution against the employees, without any consideration of the merits of the facts leading up to the case? Is this the position? </para>

In my view, if this is what the Act provides, it is highly reprehensible and should not be tolerated.

Of course, everybody has committed some indiscretion in the past, and 1 would like to refer to the fact that in 1961 the honourable member for Moreton was returned to this Parliament on Communist Party preferences. He was responsible for the Menzies Government being returned to power. We all recall that we had to wait about 3 weeks for the result and, while the then Prime Minister was pacing up and down bis study, the suspense was &#39;kill in&#39;. The facts are, of course, that in 1961 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> was returned as Prime Minister of this country by the election of the honourable member for Moreton and by Communist Party preferences. At that stage the Prime Minister referred to the honourable member as the &#39;Magnificent Killen&#39;. He has never lost that sobriquet. Tonight I thought he was brilliant. As a matter of fact, I thought he would have beaten Peter Falk for the Academy Award in the United States of America any day of the week. </para>

We do want an answer as to what this clause really means and as to whether people can be prosecuted by the owner of a vessel. These are the things we must learn. We must be told by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> what they really mean. If they are put into effect what would it mean to the trade union movement in this regard? I repeat that the honourable member for Moreton has hurt the feelings of my colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh and I hope that it will not happen again during the course of this debate. </para>

It is true that from the Government side there has been only one speech, and that was from the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> J suppose he amused us with his quotations, as he generally amuses us, but in his usual inimitable fashion he did not say anything. He used a lot of words but said nothing. He did say on one occasion that he unblushingly said something or other. I would be delighted to hear of the situation in which the honourable member for Moreton would blush. It would probably make a wharf labourer blush.

            <para>- No, that is all right. He quoted from comments made by the late and most revered <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt.</inline> Indeed his conservative colleagues who sit around him invariably do refer to past events. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> also is sitting on the front bench at the moment. I have heard him quote in this chamber documents written in 1947 and 1949 and endeavour to convince us that the opinions expressed in them are applicable to contemporary society. I cannot be persuaded by that sort of argument. This is 1972. There are circumstances existing in 1972 that did not exist in 1947 or 1949, which I remind the Committee were about 25 years or a whole generation ago. As I have said, the circumstances that existed in those times are not applicable in 1972. So where is the validity in honourable members opposite taking themselves back into the past and dragging out these matters from their archives? </para>

        <para>The Minister for Social Services quoted from a letter written in 1947 and tried to relate it to a recent industrial dispute in Victoria. For the life of me, I cannot be persuaded that there is any relevance in this. The platform of the Australian Labor Party, of which I am very proud to be a member, implacably says that there shall be no penal provisions. That is the chapter and verse; there is no equivocation. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps that is more than the honourable member for Angas has ever done in the time he has been in this chamber. I believe that the penal provisions are bad. They are in the legislation for one reason and for one reason only, that is to make a particular section of the community - one may say a very large section - do things whether they wish to or not. Under these provisions they will be made to do these things. The Government and its supporters are displeased if they do not do these things. Why are the supporters of the Government disappointed and aggravated if the working people of this country do not do these things? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Government will try to justify the inclusion of penal provisions by saying that the non-implementation of these provisions would have a deleterious effect on the economy of this country. I would suggest that this would have a more deleterious effect on the pockets of those who make a profit from every hour worked by the working people of this country. This is the reason why the penal provisions were introduced. </para>
        <para class="block">The legislation has been introduced to impose fines, not only on organisations but on individuals to ensure that they go to work, whatever that expression means, stay there for a set number of hours and during the course of a year enjoy only conditions that are given to them after a good deal of negotiation. If the working people choose to withdraw their services and refuse in effect to sell their commodity - that is their labour - this Government intends to come down by way of heavy handed legislation to impose fines to the tune of $1,000 a day on an individual and $500 a day on organisations to ensure that workers provide their commodity. </para>
        <para>I have tried to draw the following analogy before in the House and I repeat it to this Committee. If any employer, manufacturer or any person who provides services in this community found that it was unprofitable to make these goods or provide these services and decided he no longer would remain in that sort of business no matter how much those goods and services were needed by the community, this Government would not take a stand anywhere at all to ensure that these goods or services were provided. The Government would say that if goods or services were unprofitable to provide it was part of the free enterprise or market system that one could make one&#39;s own choice about whether to provide them. But what happens when a working man or group of working men take a free decision not to provide their commodity or services - that is their labour. They are driven to work with whips. They are dragged before the courts. They are fined and bludgeoned into providing the only service or commodity that they can sell - that is their ability to labour. </para>
        <para>This Government and governments of the same colour across the world traditionally have done this to working people. The current legislation is bad. It is bad in the eyes of the trade union movement, the Labor Party and the people of this country. Now this Government intends to compound that which is bad by adding to it to make it worse. There is not a trade union official in this country who would not tell us how restrictive and how bludgeoning were sections 109 and 111 of the Con ciliation and Arbitration Act. Yet this Government has now introduced proposals not to improve the situation but to make it worse. It intends to leave working people in the position in which orders can be issued against them. Little inquiry is to be made into the circumstances surrounding each case. There is to be a de facto case that the working people are guilty. If that means anything to my honourable friend the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> I am sure that he would agree with me that there is no inquiry in the first instance as to who is or is not guilty. An order is issued on the application of an employer and that order restricts working men in their actions. No inquiry is held at that stage to determine whether the order is good or bad or whether the circumstances are just or unjust. It is simply an order issued by the court on the application of an employer. The investigation takes place later, although the fines commence from the day that the order is issued. There is no investigation as to why that order ought or ought not to be issued. </para>
        <para>I can well understand the look of amazement on the face of the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> because I am quite sure that he is unaware of these provisions. He has not been involved and does not know that this is the situation that confronts working people in this country. The proposals are bad and they must be rejected by this Committee. The Committee must report to the House that it cannot agree with these proposals and they must be thrown out in their entirety. </para>

            <para>- One would like to tranquillise the honourable member but that would really be asking for too much. One understands how very upset the Opposition members must feel on this occasion when they are reminded of the metamorphosis which they have undergone on this issue during the course of recent months. As there has been discussion in this debate on the question of double standards and double thinking, let the Opposition recall that only some months ago its chief spokesman on industrial relations was prepared to bring down a policy which said that unionists would be subject to a $20 fine. This is not something that is consistent with the views pf this Government. Between then and this debate there has been a metamorphosis. Of course, that has been due entirely, as the honourable member for Burke is so very well aware - and let him not draw the long bow- </para>

            <para>- I understand how upset the honourable gentleman becomes over these matters. I do not want to soothe him unduly but he should recall full well what was the policy stated by the Opposition at that time. It was repudiated because of logic and lt was repudiated because of representations. And if there were representations, and the honourable gentleman says that there were, they were pressures from the left wing of the industrial movement. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Within 48 hours of the policy being announced as a major plank of the Opposition&#39;s approach to the fundamental questions of industrial relations, that policy was totally withdrawn. I know it was not at the behest of the Opposition&#39;s chief spokesman on industrial matters, a man for whom I have very high regard. We know that he agrees with the policy of sanctions because he is a realist in the industrial jurisdiction. He and no doubt some other Opposition members are well aware that a system of industrial law without some form of sanctions is a system which is totally ineffective. That explains why when one looks back on the whole history of arbitration in this country, back to 1904, there has not been a period in which there was not some form of sanction in the Act. The government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was a member refused to withdraw them in 1947. They happened to be a feature of the Labor administration and I recall that a great Labor Premier of New South Wales, the honourable J. Cahill, a man for whom presumably the Opposition would exercise a note of high regard, was a man who believed fundamentally in the need for sanctions. When one looks at any of the industrial jurisdictions around the world, at the recent British legislation, at what happens in New Zealand, the United States of America and practically any other country that comes to mind, it is clear that sanctions are an integral form of industrial jurisdiction. </para>
        <para>There were other questions raised in relation to the application of new sections. Proposed new section 32 continues the approach adopted by the 1970 Act, that is, that the seeking of a bans clause in awards is such an important process and places such firm obligations upon organisations if it is to be granted that it warrants consideration by a presidential member of the Commission and certainly no-one else. This illustrates the Government&#39;s firm but restrained approach to this important question of the application of sanctions. The Government is wedded to the principle of sanctions in the Act but recognises that every opportunity should be given to settle disputes by the traditional processes of conciliation and arbitration. In other words, sanctions are a last resort and the Government has made this perfectly clear over a long period of time. When an application for a bans clause comes before a presidential member of the Commission the nature of the hearing is such that every opportunity will be given to the parties to resolve their differences and avoid the making of a bans clause if they are prepared to act with good will and in the best interests of their members. A bans clause is the first step in the application of sanctions provisions. It provides the opportunities to which I have made reference. If an organisation acts sensibly it need not be taken any further along the road to the imposition of a penalty under section 119. </para>
        <para class="block">But if the attitude of the offending organisation is such that the Commission has no alternative but to insert a bans clause, the steps towards the final phase of the imposition of a penalty quicken but not such as to make the question of punishment inevitable. </para>
        <para>There is interposed before the imposition of penalty the process of proposed new section 33 to which the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> made reference. This also maintains the concept of the 1970 amendments. Again every opportunity is given to an organisation to use the processes of conciliation and arbitration. The section recognises that only a presidential member of the Commission may deal with it and this is further recognised by the fact that the presidential member will have the powers of both conciliation and arbitration. This is a significant departure from the new scheme of the Act. But that it is such a departure once again establishes the Government&#39;s firm yet restrained approach to this whole question. There is one significant change which is made in the proposed new section 33. Whilst it gives wide discretion to the presidential member as to how he will deal with applications under section 33, he is obliged to issue a certificate and so open up proceedings in the industrial court where conduct in the form of strikes or bans is taking place notwithstanding all his best efforts to bring about a cessation of that conduct. </para>
        <para>In summary, what section 33 provides is as follows: Firstly, that no penalty action for a breach of a bans clause can be taken in the court unless the alleged breach is notified under section 33 and a certificate is issued by a presidential member; secondly, that when a notification is received, the presidential member is to inquire into the matters alleged in the notice, attempt to stop conduct occurring if it has commenced or is threatened, and issue a certificate as to such conduct unless he is satisfied that a prompt settlement will be effected or that the conduct is about to cease; thirdly, where conduct has ceased but a certificate is asked for, a presidential member is to inquire into the matters alleged in the notice and shall not issue a certificate if he thinks that to do so would be undesirable having regard to the circumstances in which it ceased or the terms of settlement that were arrived at. With specific reference to the question raised by the honourable member for Barker, I direct his attention- </para>

          <para>- I want to correct something which my gallant and learned friend - learned anyhow - the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> said. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> put strike penalties into the Act or that he refused to take them out; it does not matter which. The history df this ma tter is as follows and I am drawing on a paper that I wrote some time ago after researching the matter thoroughly. From; 1930 till at least 1947 there were absolutely no penal clauses. Occasionally, but very occasionally, a provision was made in an award imposing obligations on organisations and in these cases the penalty then provided under the Act, namely a fine of &#163;100,: could be imposed for a breach of the award. The offences would not be continuous offences, incurring daily penalties, as is now the case. The first occasion when penal powers reappeared was in 1947 as a result of the 40-hour week case. When the 40-hour week was introduced the arbitration court provided that reasonable overtime should be worked and that an organisation should not be concerned in any ban on overtime. This was said to be a temporary measure only. When one looks at volume 59 of the Commonwealth Arbitration Reports at page 609 one will see the specific reference and indications given by the court at that time. The breach of that provision could make an organisation liable to a penalty. But the penalty was &#163;100. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In 1951, on the application of employers, the court introduced bans clauses which it then held were punishable in the event of a breach by use of the powers defined, namely, prison for contempt. It should be noted that the present  President  of the Commonwealth Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby, was a dissenting member of the Bench which made that decision. Among the comments that he made was this: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I am not convinced that the Court should convert offences which are not in themselves in the nature of contempt into contempt for the purpose of obtaining a jurisdiction which it otherwise doss not possess. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So, one wlD see that even up until that stage  -  1951  -  the Court obtained its power to punish strikes through its contempt powers and not from any other specific powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kirby, in reference to another point made by the employers, said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Nevertheless, to my, mind, it would be calamitous if their presence in awards- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is. the bans clause in awards -  were used as a means of imposing unlimited penalties,- </para>
        <para class="block">That is what contempt powers give a court, or did at that time give a court -  in glaring contrast with the extremely limited scale laid down in the Act, on such Unions as commit and continue breaches of them. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Foster expressed part dissent, and the then Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Raymond</inline> Kelly and, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy approved the insertion of the bans provisions in the clause. </para>
        <para>However, since that time, the extension of the clauses has been largely by the courts and not by the Parliament, with some belated legislative action subsequently taken to endeavour to patch up the, difficulties which were being created by the Courts&#39; insertion into awards things which the Court was not authorised by the Act to do. In the metal trades case which went to the High Court of Australia and which is reported in volume 82 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 208, the High Court, in considering bans clauses and the then state of the Act, considered an order that the union concerned should cause its members to work overtime, and in other judgments pointed out that this was far beyond any provision in the award or any Act at that time, and that the only requirement to be found in the award was that the organisation should not be a party to a ban. Subsequently, sections 29 (b) and (c), as they then stood, were amended to enable contempt proceedings to be taken for a breach of award, as well as of the Act. Later, as everyone knows, section 111 was added which gave the previous power to fine organisations $1,000 for failing to comply with an order of the Court. Quite plainly, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> did not put into the Act the specific power of the Court to impose strike penalties. The imposition of strike penalties was secured by judicial act - by judge-made law. If you like, it was secured by stealth - not by a deliberate decision of this Parliament, as the honourable member for Moreton tries to imagine. </para>
        <para>I refer in passing to what my honourable friend said about the question of enforceable industrial agreements. </para>
        <para>Before I do mention that subject, as time may cut out on me, I categorically deny the assertion made by the Minister that I agree with the Government&#39;s policy on strike sanctions. I never have agreed with it and I challenge the Minister to quote any statement that I have ever made anywhere at any time, saying that I agree with strike sanctions being applied to people who refuse to accept work in accordance with the immediate requirements of the award. What I did say, what I still say and what I always will say, is that where freely negotiated voluntary industrial agreements are reached between unions and the employers it is the duty of the unions and the employers to honour those agreements. Where the unions decide, with the consent of their members, to incorporate into the agreement enforcement provisions, it is proper that those enforcement provisions shall apply. </para>
        <para>The Meat Industry Employees Union already has those kinds of enforcement provisions written into its agreements. They have worked and the. penalties imposed upon the employees for a breach of agreements are applied. The result is that the workers are .10 per cent better off than they could have been under the award. There are very few strikes now in this most turbulent of all industries because the unions officials are honouring their compact. Union officials are not people who repudiate freely negotiated voluntary agreements. It is an absolute lie and a distortion of the facts for anybody to say that union officials repudiate their agreements. Of course they do not. This would apply even to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edgar</inline> Williams, whose organisation has signed agreements which attract from the Act the savage penalty incorporated within the Act - the $1,000 penalty contained in section 119. I do not think anybody could accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> of being a person who would break his word to the employers. </para>

        <para>The Australian Labor Party policy is not in shreds, as the honourable member said. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has stated quite clearly that where unions make agreements under its auspices, the ACTU will see that the agreement is carried out. The Townsville meeting of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party supported my concept of industrial agreement, saying that where unions recommended to their members that agreements should contain enforcement provisions and the members agreed to those enforcement provisions, that was a matter for the. unions themselves to determine. It is their business and of course they are bound by whatever they agree. That is what I have said. I have said it all along. I say it now, and that will be the policy on which we will fight the election. It is a policy that will work, but the Government&#39;s policy - this stupid policy that we are now debating - just will not work any better than it has over the last 22 years. </para>

          <para>- This clause seeks to amend section 39 of the Principal Act, which is a very important section, by adding the following new subsection: (2.) In proceedings before the Commission under section thirty-one, section thirty-four or section thirty-five of this Act, the Commission shall, in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings. </para>

        <para class="block">This is an unwarranted extension of the Government&#39;s right to intervene in matters that it considers to be of public interest. It can only lead to the frustration of the processes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It will create delays and impose additional expense on employees and employee organisations. This Bill, in effect, envisages agreements and even minor awards being subjected to hearing by the full bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at the behest of this Government. This fact, coupled with the Government&#39;s policy of wage and salary freezing, and the unlimited right of manufacturers and retailers to increase prices, will place employees, particularly those represented by unions which adhere to the ordinary processes of conciliation and arbitration, in an impossible position. The proposed new sub-section is an extension of section 31 (3.) of the present Act which states, inter alia, that the arbitration authority may refuse to certify if it is of the opinion that it is not in the public interest that an agreement should be certified. I again refer to the question: Who is to define &#39;public interest&#39;? One would consider that to keep people at work at reasonable rates of pay and conditions of employment would be in the public interest. </para>
        <para>I draw attention to what I said only a few minutes ago. Public interest has now become the important part of this Act. It is not easy to define what is the public interest.  As  I said before, at one time acts of God were used to stop workers from receiving their just rights. It used to be said that God was on the side of the biggest battalions; now he is on the side of those people who have the control and the authority in this Parliament and the judges of these courts. This is what the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> had to say in his second reading speech in regard to the question of the Commission having to pay regard to economic consequences: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have already emphasised the implications that decisions of the Commission can have for the national economy. Therefore, the Bill proposes an amendment of section 39 of the Act to ensure that, when the Commission is constituted to deal with appeals and references and with the reserved matters under the new section 31, it shall, in considering the public interest, have regard in particular to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that it might make. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I say that the Government simply is passing the buck. Section 39 of the principal Act is to be amended by adding a new sub-section (2.) which, inter alia, states:  . . the Commission shall, in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings. </para>
        <para class="block">This is an unwarranted extension of the Government&#39;s right to intervene in matters that it considers to be of public interest. It will create delays and additional expense to the employee and employer organisations. The provision seeks to place the Commission in the position of giving undue weight to economic considerations, even when a just and reasonable case has been advanced for improvement in wages and salary standards or in working conditions. It places the Commission in the invidious position of having to assess the future of the economy, which is something that the Government could not do as was revealed by the last Budget and the shifting ground since then by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden).</inline> It will have a restrictive influence on the Commission in its efforts to come to a just and reasonable decision in accordance with the evidence before it. The Government is seeking to make the Commission assume responsibility for the overall economy - a responsibility that obviously is one that can be properly exercised only at government level. It is asking the Commission to do the Government&#39;s dirty work. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s appearance in the national wage case was not in the public interest, as the Government claims, but in its own political interests. That is why it appeared before the Commission. It tries to shift the responsibility for economic control and unpopular measures away from itself to the Commission. The function of controlling the economy is surely the duty of the Government, not of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The primary role of the Commission is to settle industrial disputes, not to manage the economy. The Government has shirked its responsibility for controlling the economy. In 1959 the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review advocated a widening of the economic powers of the Commonwealth, but here again the Government failed to act. The Government shirked its responsibility by putting to one side that review of constitutional reform. </para>
        <para>The Commission always states that it looks at the whole of the evidence placed before it on any matter on which it has to adjudicate and makes its decision in the light of that evidence. Without doubt, when the Government makes submissions to the Commission, as it did in the recent national wage case, the Commission gives weight to the economic evidence placed before it, but the degree of the weight depends upon the material presented as a whole, and I think undue weight was given to the submissions of the Commonwealth Government in this recent wage case. The Bill seeks to insert into the Act provisions to place the Commission in the position of giving undue weight to economic considerations, even when a just and reasonable case has been advanced for improvements in wages and salary standards or working conditions. Further, it places the Commission in the invidious position of having to assess the future of the economy, a most difficult task as the Government has found out. The last Budget and the results flowing from it show clearly that the Government, even with the expert advice that was available to it, was unable to read the future of the economy and this is amply demonstrated by the shifting ground of the Prime Minister and Treasurer in recent months. </para>
        <para>The major effect of the proposed change is that it will have a restrictive influence on the Commission in its efforts to come to a just and reasonable decision in accordance with the evidence placed before it. The Government is seeking to make the Commission take responsibility for the overall economy of this country, a responsibility that obviously can be properly carried out only by the Government if it has the guts to do it. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that the last part of the last sentence is the crux of the whole matter, namely, &#39;the right settlement of the dispute&#39;. If we are speaking about conciliation, which seems to me to be what we are speaking about, we are speaking about getting the parties to a dispute- of course the word &#39;conciliation&#39; presupposes that a dispute exists - together in order to arrive at some sort of settlement. I do not think that there would be any disagreement in the community with that proposition. My respected friend the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> has already made this point but I would like to elaborate on it. Apart from being a conciliatory body, and being expected to resolve a dispute that exists between 2 people or 2 groups of people, the Commission, in considering that dispute and its settlement, is expected to take into account the very ethereal quality called the national economy, an expression that the honourable &#39; member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> who is not here at  the moment, would, I am sure, take issue on, as he does with the question of ihe public interest. It is a very difficult, almost impossible, expression to define. Yet these expressions are liberally - that is a small T - splattered throughout this whole Bill. </para>
        <para>To talk about the national economy and to expect the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to have some expertise in this matter is an act of arrant nonsense, even blatant arrogance, on the part of the Government. It is a denial and a refusal by the Government to accept its rightful role in the community. I see the role of a national government as being to consider the national economy as it sees it from time to time and not to depute that right to another body, certainly a body such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which, during its hearing of national wage cases over a period of years, has indicated clearly that its knowledge of what the national economy is all about is very limited. There have been so many contradictions in the decisions handed down from time to time by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it ceases to be humorous. On a number of occasions the court has said one thing in one national wage case decision, and the reverse in another. The latest and perhaps most glaring example of that is that some 2 or 3 years ago the court agreed with a submission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson,</inline> who was the employers representative at that time, that the national economy, which was being ostensibly considered then, would be better off with a national wage and that there should be no longer the structure which we knew and which seemed to serve the purpose so well of a basic wage and a margin for skill. So that was disposed of. The arguments put by the Australian Council of Trade Unions were disregarded. The body which made that decision is the body which is now expected <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take into account the national economy. Some 2 or 3 years later the court now agrees that the national wage concept does not work. </para>
        <para>It would be better if we had a way to determine the sum on which a man, his wife and his children could live, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Higgins introduced in the Harvester award in the first national basic wage decision, and then a margin for skill. There has been a complete reversal of form by the Commission. I am not quarrelling with the right of the Commission to be inconsistent because the inconsistencies are fundamental inconsistencies which clearly illustrate to me - and I do not hold myself out as a paragon of the community but I think I am a average member of the community and I believe that most members of the community share this view - that the Commission has demonstrated on more than one occasion that it is incapable of considering and not properly equipped to consider the questions of the economy which are placed before it. </para>
        <para>We are now talking about the settlement of disputes. We are not talking about national wage cases. We are not talking about anything other than a settlement of an industrial dispute according to the provisions of section 39 of the principal Act. If the Government is seriously concerned about the number of man-days that are lost through disputes in this country it will have greater concern after this Bill is passed because there can be no question that a dispute which could be relatively and simply solved by the good offices of a conciliator will be dragged on and on as the Commission considers the national economy in the light of public interest. Already one honourable member on the Government side, a man learned in the law, has said to us how very very difficult it is even to define &#39;the public interest&#39;. He is not in the chamber at present to tell us how much easier or more difficult - and I would believe more difficult - it would be to define the national economy. </para>
        <para>It is not a question of courts deciding. If it were a question of the courts deciding, let us dissolve this whole place, pay us all off and send us home so that we can enjoy the comfort, of our own homes instead of coming to this Parliament to put forward propositions that are going to be steamrolled by the Government on the basis of the strength of its numbers without any cognisance being taken of that which is said. It is not possible to resolve an industrial dispute if the commissioners who are appointed to resolve the dispute have to concern themselves with the national economy. That is the function of the people who sit on the other side of this chamber. After the end of this year when the first Whitlam ministry takes its place in this  chamber there will be more of us with him on the other side than there are now on this side and there will be fewer members on this side of the chamber. When we sit on that side it will be our function to take into account all matters that affect the national economy and not to depute that function to somebody else. It will be our right and we will ensure that it will be carried out. We will not squib the issue as the Government is squibbing the issue in this proposed amendment to section 39 of the principal Act and I hope that the Committee will reject it. </para>

          <para>- Clause 19 deals with sections 45 and 46 of the Principal Act, and the important matter with which at deals is secret ballots. I pose the question: How will secret ballots on strikes limit the duration of strikes? If a ballot is carried by the members of the unions the strike is on and the ballot has the effect of legalising the strike. There is no doubt about that. The strike cannot be called off until another secret ballot is held, so its effect would be to continue the strike instead of limiting it. Of course, most strikes nowadays are of limited duration. They may last a few hours or they may last one or two days, but if a ballot has to be taken before a strike can be ended it means that it could go on for a long time indeed. The strike in fact would be taken out of the hands of union officials. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I invite the attention of honourable members to some figures that I should like to quote. In 1929 a ballot on a strike was conducted under the control of the court and resulted in a vote of 5,318 against and 732 for the proposition that those affected be prepared to work under the existing award. On that occasion 9,000 ballot papers were burnt. The court can order a ballot under the existing law. That section has been in the Act for many years but has been used on only 3 occasions. This Bill does not leave any room for manoeuvre on the part of union officials. It could mean that once a ballot has been carried the full settlement of the original demand must be met or the strike goes on. A strike can blow up quite easilyand suddenly but once the first emotional step has been taken the heat goes off to some extent. Skilful negotiation by officials from both sides can limit a strike to a short duration. This Bill will harden the attitude to a strike once a vote has been carried. </para>
        <para class="block">All room to manoeuvre will be lost and conciliation and compromise will be impossible. </para>
        <para>The strike weapon is not illegal in Great Britain, the United States of America or in Australia. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not prohibit strikes, though it did so until 1930 when the prohibition was removed. It is true, as we have heard tonight, that the Commission has power to include in its awards a ban on strikes. I emphasise to the Committee that we cannot expect a system of industrial arbitration to eliminate entirely strikes and other forms of direct action. Anyone who believes that is attributing to arbitration a function it cannot possibly fulfil. The laws of the land relating to the settlement of disputes are much more easily applied by the State to individuals than to powerful organisations such as trade unions. The State, in attempting to exercise compulsion over trade unions, is dealing with a powerful section of the community. A huge majority of people accept the fact that common law courts and criminal courts enforce a law with which they agree but in the field of industrial conflict their outlook is quite different. In this area there are no set principles of what is fair, reasonable or just. The arbitration system deals with questions on which the community as a whole is divided into 2 camps. Workers and employers have their own view of what is reasonable and what is just. </para>
        <para>There is no doubt - and all members on this side of the House would agree with me - about the value and importance of our conciliation and arbitration system but it is ridiculous to think that it can usher in a reign of peace in  industral  relations. Noone would deny the value and importance of international law but conflicts arise between countries and those differences are sometimes so severe that all observance of law is swept away. We are all aware of an instance of this happening at present. Our arbitration courts successfully settle hundreds of issues brought before them but they cannot succeed in every matter. The system would be strengthened if this Government were to accept the reality of the situation which is that in our community there are issues and conflicts so acute that no court could hope to find an acceptable solution. </para>
        <para>I want to draw attention to what happened in Britain, according to a recent review of this matter. The most direct overseas evidence unequivocally rejects such proposals for secret ballots on strikes. The British Royal Commission headed by Lord Donovan dealt specifically with this matter in these terms in its report which was handed down in 1968: 426. Compulsory Strike Ballots </para>
        <para>A number of witnesses have suggested to us that a secret ballot should be required before a strike can lawfully take place. This proposal is based on the belief that workers are likely to be less militant than their leaders and that, given the opportunity of such a ballot, they would often be likely to vote against strike action. 427. It is clear that the scope of any legislation to this end, if it were to be effective, would have to be confined to major official strikes. A law forbidding strike action before the holding of a secret ballot could not be enforced in the case of small-scale unofficial stoppages, which make up the overwhelming majority of the total number of strikes. 428. There is little justification in the available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirms this. Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action. This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Two instances of ballots held in recent years in this country where the vote went against strike action are sometimes quoted in support of the case for compulsory secret ballots. One was held in connection with an industry-wide wage claim in engineering in 1962, and one in connection with action to secure the reinstatement of certain employees dismissed by the Ford Motor Company in 1963. But these ballots were held on the initiative of the unions concerned. They do not provide reliable evidence of what the outcome would be if ballots were held in quite different circumstances and under the compulsion of the law. 429. There are other objections to such ballots. Once a vote has been taken and has gone in favour of strike action, the resulting stoppage may delay a settlement by restricting union leaders&#39; freedom of action. Moreover, how is the question on which the vote ls to be taken to be framed. If the vote is, for instance, about whether to accept the employers&#39; latest offer, its result can be stultified if the employer subsequently makes a slightly improved offer. 430. We do not recommend that it should be compulsory by law, either generally or in certain denned cases, to hold a ballot of the employees affected upon the question whether strike action should be taken. We think it preferable that trade union leaders should bear, and be seen to bear, the responsibility of deciding when to call a strike and when to call it off. Occasions may of course arise when union leaders would themselves wish to hold such a ballot or are required to do so by their rules. The decision on such a matter should continue to rest with the unions. </para>
        <para class="block">I suggest that those words used in the report of the British Royal Commission headed by Lord Donovan, handed down in 1968, are appropriate to the proposal of this Government for the question of strike action to be decided by secret ballot. I suggest to the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> that the Government is making a mistake. Instead of reducing the period of a strike, when it unfortunately happens, the holding of a ballot will lengthen the period. Ballots will have to be taken to see whether the strikers will go back to work which will be a damned stupid situation. </para>

          <para>- I should like to associate myself completely with the remarks made by the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb).</inline> I refer very quickly - I understand that we have to deal with this entire clause very quickly  -  te proposed new section 46. Honourable members will note that this deals with offences relating to ballots and provides for a penalty of $500 or imprisonment for 6 months for such offences. I should like to draw the Committee&#39;s attention to proposed new sub-section (3.) of clause 46, which states, relevantly from my point of view, that a person shall not, in connection with a ballot ordered under section 45 of the Act, offer or suggest any loss or disadvantage for or on account of any support of, or opposition to, voting in a particular manner. I suggest that the whole point of voting revolves about this very point. It is suggested to people that they will benefit or be at a disadvantage depending on whether they vote yes or no, Liberal or Labor or for or against whatever the proposition is. Surely the whole point of having an intelligent vote is to have a discussion about what the advantages and disadvantages would be of voting for or against a proposition. It seems quite ridiculous to me that a penalty of $500 or imprisonment for 6 months should be incurred if a person puts, in connection with one of these ballots, the proposition that if, for example, the workers vote against the strike it means they will be at a disadvantage on account of opposing that strike, or vice versa. Surely this is not intended, and I should like to hear the Minister&#39;s explanation. </para>

          <para>-  I oppose this provision. This is another one of the proposals the Government has put forward that just will not work. The Government knows that it will not work. It is a good political gimmick. It sounds good at electioneering time. It is perhaps a means of obtaining donations to the campaign fund by foolish, naive employers who think that by having secret ballots on strikes we will stop strikes. What I want employers to know - and I am surprised that the Government did not tell them this - is that we have had this sort of provision in the Act now for many years. It has been in the Act for decades. The law, in section 45 of the Act, already allows this to be done. The Government has never implemented section 45. For 22 years this section has lain dormant in the Act. Not once has the Government ever resorted to it, and it had good reason not to use it. The only previous occasion on which it was ever actually implemented was during the timber workers strike of 1929, when a ballot was conducted and by an overwhelming majority the workers in the timber dispute decided to support the strike. This supports what we have always said: It is not the union officials who cause strikes; the union officials merely react to the demands that come from the people at the factory floor level for strike action when those people feel that so-called constitutional means have failed them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another feature of the provision - this shows the duplicity of the Government&#39;s whole attitude - is that, when a strike ballot is taken and a strike is approved in cases where the award concerned contains a provision prohibiting individual employees from going on strike, it is still an offence and the individual employees who have had their strike ballot and voted in favour of the strike are still acting in contravention of the award, even after the strike ballot is held. </para>

In fact I happen to know - I cannot reveal to the Minister my source of information, but it certainly was not one of hig officers - that the officers of his Department prepared a paper on the operation of section 45 and the whole question of strike ballots, and they told his predecessor that section 45 would not work and that it was unenforceable or unworkable. The officers of the Department who prepared that paper were absolutely correct. They knew what they were talking about. The Minister says: &#39;I do not want good advice; I want political advice. I want something that will get us some votes. I want something that makes it sound as though I am fighting the unions and I am fighting against strikes. I want people to think that all of a sudden I have a secret weapon that will put an end to all strikes. We never had it before, it is something I have just discovered.&#39; Of course, it was not a recent discovery at all; it has been in the Act for donkey&#39;s years. It has never worked and never will work. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joe</inline>Riordan, who cannot be said to be a raving, extreme left winger or a communist, says that the whole thing is preposterous. He says that once we pass this law we will pass the control of the trade union movement and policies on strikes over to the militant shop stewards and to other people who are closer to the ear of the rank and file than are the union officials. He says that it is quite calamitous to bring in such a proposal. On the employers side, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McPhee</inline> said that the Chamber of Manufactures had never asked for secret ballots to be introduced, although it would consider any proposals that the Government would make. He said that the Chamber would rather see legislation which confined the election of union officials to no more than 3 years. Then the rank and file could vote out union officials who made decisions with which they were dissatisfied. This is the whole crux of the matter. </para>

I have been a union official as have some other honourable members. We know that you cannot with utter and total abandon disregard the views of the rank and file. I shall quote from the leading article of the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; of 8th September  1971.  It dealt with the union opposition to secret ballots for strikes and the way that union officials see the position. The article also dealt with the New South Wales legislation; which is the legislation upon which the present proposal has been patterned to a large extent. The article states: </para>

          <para>- I want to intervene briefly in this matter because it seems to be highlighted in the debate on this clause that the Opposition has quite misunderstood the main impact of this Bill and the main intentions behind it. I noticed this earlier in the debate in regard to the sanctions clause, but the same kind of thing is coming out now. Surely what we are trying to do is to protect the men against the tyranny of the union machine. One would have thought that the Opposition, if it had readily been on the side of the men, would have been very glad for this kind of provision to operate.

            <para>- One would have thought that the Opposition would have been welcoming this clause, if the interjection of my honourable friend is to be taken at its face value. If the provision in the Act is good already one would have thought that the Opposition would have welcomed this clause which would make it better. But the Opposition does not do that. I am afraid that it is not really concerned with the interests of the men. It is concerned with the interests of the. union officials. It is concerned with maintaining the coherence of the trade union machine which can become - it is not always so - a tyranny over its members. The members of the unions are naturally looking to the Government to protect them against the tyranny of trade union officials, and that is what this Bill is all about. </para>

        <para class="block">Amendment No. 1 amends clause 45 of the Bill by substituting the word &#39;shall&#39; for may&#39;. It relates to cases where the Court in an action under section 140 of the Act finds that an organisation&#39;s rules are defective or that it does not have rules it is required to have. The Court orders the organisation to bring its rules into conformity with the Act and clause 45 provides the means for doing this. It provides that if the organisation does not do so within 3 months the Registrar may himself make the necessary amendments. It was considered that the requirement for the Registrar  to do this should be mandatory rather than discretionary; otherwise the court&#39;s direction might still not be given effect to. Thus the amendment proposes that the word may&#39; shall be replaced by the word &#39;shall&#39;. </para>
        <para>The second amendment amends clause 46 of the Bill. Clause 46 amends section 141 of the Act to provide a limitation on the precise time in which challenges can be made to elections for office bearers conducted by the organisations themselves. The reasons were to give office bearers reasonable security of tenure in the event of innocent defects in their election being found after lengthy periods. Primarily it was to overcome the problems created by the Moore v. Doyle decision in which it was held that some members of a State union were not eligible to be members of the State branch of a federal union which was regarded as the same body. The Bill restricts such challenges to a period of 6 months after the elections. It has, however, been strongly put that in many cases it is difficult to ascertain the facts which will lead to action of this nature within a period of 6 months, perhaps because of some fraud en the part of the persons in control of the election. </para>
        <para>The amendment proposes to extend from 6 months to 12 months the period in which an applicant may challenge under section 141 an election for office bearers conducted by the organisation itself. It is also designed to provide that where an applicant could not by reasonable diligence have obtained the necessary facts and evidence to take action within a period of 12 months, the court permits him to take such action. There <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> a further proviso that the court shall not allow the use of this let out clause after the period of office involved in the election. For example, if a person is elected for 4 years an action cannot be taken at all after that time. </para>

It appears to me that if anybody can intervene in these proceedings, unions can be up for a lot of money because of outsiders intervening just for the purpose of breaking a particular union. The interveners could cause that union a lot of legal expense especially as their legal expenses are covered by the Commonwealth Government. I would like to find out, therefore, just who would or could be an intervener in these proceedings. </para>

          <para>-  The Sydney Atlantean bus dispute could be dealt with by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because the drivers operating the buses came, under a federal award. Although the dispute was not interstate in character the drivers were covered by a federal award. This is where the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission can intervene, as it can in a dispute in a factory, for instance, if the people working in that factory are covered by a federal award. </para>

          <para>- I would like to think that the Government will be encouraged to abandon clause 50 and not to proceed with it in this Committee. If the Minister will give an indication that the Government will, have another look at the implications of this clause, I will not continue with my observations. But, in the absence of that undertaking, I indicate that I would speak in opposition to the proposal and I certainly would vote against it. Now, as I understand the Minister, he has indicated that he is prepared to listen to fresh argument that I may advance to him outside the Committee - in other words, clause 50 would not be passed by this Committee- and that it would go- </para>

There is no gathering on the front bench of this Parliament - none - which will persuade me. to abandon the stand that I take- none at all. I will not be persuaded by any person who takes the view that this Committee should lightly embark on support for a fundamentally new principle. The Minister for Labour and National Service is in charge of this Bill. Happily, the Minister for the Navy is not. If the Minister for the Navy wants to move a censure motion here or anywhere else, I hope he can muster the quality of courage to do so.

            <para>- I am talking about clause 50 which requires every organisation to register with the Registrar where it does its banking. If the Minister for Labour and National Service were to say that he was prepared to listen to fresh submissions and argument on the matter, I would not continue. However, if the honourable gentleman were to say that we must have the argument out here and now, I would offer no complaint about that and I would continue with my views on the subject. </para>

        <para>To me, this invites argument and I hope that the invitation will be accepted by every person, irrespective of his views on politics. In my view, this is the most extraordinary proposal I have ever seen in a statute. Yesterday, in the chambers of one of the most distinguished lawyers in this country, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dan</inline> Casey, I pulled from the shelf at random a statute volume of the Queensland Parliament and I opened it at random. It dealt with the Rabbit Act Amendment Act and the penalty provided for was $200. Is it seriously to be suggested that, every time a penalty is provided for in an Act, those who may possibly infringe it should indicate where they do their banking? I will have no bar of this. I issue no threats. I am not like some wilful individuals whom I see around me who, irrespective of the issue, will walk across and say: &#39;I will defeat a government&#39;. I will indicate my views in this Committee and in this Parliament on the merits and I will defend my views in the Parliament and in the country. This to me is one of the most reprehensible proposals I have ever seen. I do not know who was the genius who thought of it. I only hope that he does not get a C.B.E. for it. If the Minister would say to me that he would have another look at the clause, that would be the end of it. </para>
        <para>I want to illustrate very quickly to the Minister and to the Committee how easily this could be defeated. If individuals or organisations - an organisation is a trade union, an employers organisation such as the Metal Trades Industry Association Qf Australia or anything else - do not put before the Registrar where they bank, they are exposed to a penalty. I do not complain about that. But what are the provisions of the Bill? It provides that a &#39;financial institution&#39; means: </para>

        <para class="block">I will give the Minister for Labour and National Service one quick illustration as to how this could be circumvented by a person who would still be within the law. He could nominate a person to be a trustee and that would be the end of it. A trustee is not a financial institution. A trustee is not a bank. A trustee is not one who receives money lent to him by way of deposit. A trustee is not one who provides safe deposits. That is the answer to the provision in one simple practical explanation. The second one is this: Assume there is a dispute and union X is opposed by organisation A and the matter is before the court. It is obvious that there will be a row, so the  president  of the union says: AH right, here is a cheque, go over and clean out the bank account. Here is a biscuit tin. Put the money in that tin and bury it near the pawpaw tree in my back yard.&#39; Suddenly he is before the court after the court has issued an order garnisheeing the bank account or some order of attachment. When asked where the money is, he refuses to answer. This is precisely the case in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Shea</inline> was involved. I am not canvassing that; I am talking of practical politics. I look back upon the Federal platform of the Liberal Party, which is something which I have had to do with in contra-distinction to some of the Johnnycomelatelys in this place. Section 92 refers to democratic control of their own organisation by unionists, assisted where appropriate by secret ballots and supervised where necessary by the industrial court. If any person tells me, with their cerebral processes normal, that this legislation gives democratic control of their own organisation by unionists, then I will be prepared to argue the point. </para>
        <para>I turn now to &#39;Broad Highways&#39;, a Liberal Party publication put out some years ago. The  chairman  of the Party research group was the Rt  Hon  William McMahon. I do not want to embarrass him or the Committee, but I served on that Committee too. We came to this conclusion on the platform dealing with industrial matters: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The platform clearly sets out the industrial principles that should shape Liberal thinking- high wages, industrial organisation, conciliation and arbitration, profit sharing, the progressive increase of leisure and living standards, democratic control of unionists of their own affairs. </para>

        <para class="block">I say to the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Manufactures and to every metal trades and employers organisation in Australia that if this proposal had been introduced by a Labor Government there would have been a hue and cry up and down the countryside. </para>
        <para>I will have no part of this, none at all. Even though I stand alone, stand I will. I oppose this proposal. I oppose it here, I oppose it outside, and I will oppose it wherever the suggestion is made for needless intervention and forthe state to say You shall do as we say&#39;. No person, no matter the quality of his divinity, will persuade me to depart from that. </para>

          <para>- I want to raise a minor matter with the Minister. First, I ask how broad the definition of organisation is. Does it cover organisations such as the ACTU, State trades hall councils and similar bodies, or does it cover individual unions? If it covers individual unions, does it also cover individual employers who should be placed on the same basis? If the latter case applies, will the Minister inform me what the effect would be on the provisions of this Act if the employer is a bank. </para>

          <para>- This clause, in rugby league parlance, is what is called a double tackle. It does not satisfy the viciousness of the Government to impose the penal clauses upon the trade union movement; the Government wants to make sure that it humiliates the trade unions to the utmost because for many years when it has come to the real crunch and the Government has gone to the point of imposing a penalty and seeking to collect it, there is generally some good fairy who comes to life and pays the money. In many cases the good fairy is very obviously some employer or some business interest who realises that as a matter of stark common sense it is better to pay the money into court than to suffer the disruption, dislocation and loss of business that would result from the ultimate collection of the penalty from the assets of the union involved. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>But that is not sufficient; the Government does not want to be balked of its prey. The Government wants to carry this right through to the limit because it has a particular interest with the forthcoming election in provoking industrial disturbances for its own political survival. This clause is intended for exactly that purpose. Apart from that, there is the general question of the sanctity of banking. I quite agree with the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> that there is not merely one way; any competent lawyer could think of half a dozen ways to get around this Bill. Nevertheless this clause is put in the Bill by design for the purpose of political provocation of the most extreme, arrogant and reprehensible kind. I agree with the honourable member for Moreton that this is something of which the Government itself should be ashamed. </para>

        <para class="block">I mention  to  the Committee that amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are technical drafting amendments. At this stage I shall not weary the Committee with an explanation of the application of those amendments to the provisions before it. But I turn to amendment No 6 which amends clause 51, which relates to the amalgamation of organisations. The existing clause, which inserts section 158l and relates to the provision of a statement in opposition to an amalgamation to go with ballot papers, could be regarded as defective in that it would be possible for a sufficiently large group of persons supporting the amalgamation to prepare a phoney case against that amalgamation and on the basis that it was the largest group that would be the case that would be submitted. </para>
        <para>The amendment provides that where more than one case against amalgamation is received a presidential member shall consult with representatives of the groups putting cases in opposition to the amalgamation and prepare a statement which will take into account, as far as practicable, the main arguments in all the cases submitted and this shall be the case to go with the ballot papers. The amendment also proposes that the regulations may provide that the official union journals shall give equitable opportunity for the publication of views against the amalgamation. This is designed to ensure that one-sided publicity does not appear in the journals. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I want to speak to clause 51. T did not hear all the amendments that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> moved because it was not easy to hear. He will correct me if what I say is contrary to any of those amendments. The provisions contained in clause 51 introduce a new version of the twist. In the period between his statement of intent of December 1971 and the introduction of this amending Bill a couple of weeks ago this happened. This new version should be called the &#39;political twist&#39;. The Democratic Labor Party played the, tune and the Minister danced to it. In. paragraph 95 of his statement of intent the Minister said: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>We will amend ... the Act ... to prevent unions from enforcing compulsory unionism. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This did not suit the Democratic Labor Party which gets most of its trade union support from the Clerks Union, a union most difficult to organise and one which compulsory unionism strongly favours. So a quick shuffle backwards took place to the tune of the DLP. The proposition was dropped. At the same time, again in tune to the DLP, the Minister introduced something which previously he had strongly supported. He made it most difficult for union amalgamation to take place. This did not receive a mention in his statement of intent.  His  speech at the Central Industrial Secretariat dinner on 2nd March showed his attitude towards amalgamation. This was a dinner connected with the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat for the purpose of amalgamating 2 employer bodies - the Employers Federation and the Chamber of Manufactures - to co-ordinate their industrial relations policies. He pointed out that the reason which had motivated them to form that body were no doubt those that the 3 metal trades unions would put forward in support of their plans to amalgamate. It is interesting to refer to some of the statements the Minister made at this dinner. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The legislation provides certain criteria to be fulfilled by the organisations which seek to deregister. This criteria includes the holding of ballots of members in accordance with the rules of the organisations and that the de-registration should be approved by a majority of those voting. </para>
          <para>Ballots were held by the Sheet Metal Workers and the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths and, indeed, although not required to do so by the legislation the AEU also held a ballot because its rules provided for this. </para>
          <para>The results of the ballots  showed  that almost 86 per cent of those voting in the AEU ballot favoured amalgamation, 73 per cent in the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society and almost 70  per cent in the Sheet Metal Workers Union. The percentge of total membership of the union of those voting were 9 per cent AEU, 40 per cent Boilermakers and Blacksmiths and 36 per cent Sheet Metal Workers Union. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Later in that speech he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The normal voting percentages in &#39;officially conducted&#39; ballots for office bearers ranges from 12 per cent to 75 per cent, and in the majority of such elections less than 50 per cent of eligible members have voted. In addition the percentage varies substantially as between different unions and from election to election in the same union. In the Australian Railways Union the figures vary from 20 per cent to 70 per cent. In the Federated Clerks Union 40 per cent to 75 per cent. In the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners 14 per cent to 22 per cent </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">All these arguments that he advanced are against the arguments that have been put to him that he should do something about preventing the amalgamation of these 3 unions. He continued: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The 50 per cent plus proposition implies that a substantial majority of those who do not register a vote can be said to be opposed to the proposal for amalgamation. This is a doubtful thesis. It is more likely that most of those who strongly oppose the proposal will vote and that the majority of those who fail to vote are not sufficiently moved against the proposition - they merely acquiesce. </para>
          <para>Even if it were accepted that of those not voting 50 per cent were in favour and 50 per cent against - a more reasonable assumption - then the amalgamation proposal could be said to have had the support of more than 50 per cent of total membership of each of the unions. </para>
          <para>It is also pertinent to note that in Federal Parliamentary elections it is not required that a candidate must obtain the support of 50 per cent plus of all voters on the voting roll to be elected. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The effective result of introducing a 50 per cent plus voting pattern would be to stop a number of amalgamations, including, of course, amalgamations of employer bodies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Minister wiped off the point that the amalgamation will provide a large communist dominated organisation by saying that there was a minority of communists on the federal council of the amalgamated union. At page 7 of his speech on 2nd March he went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>For instance, there are some 300 unions in Australia. Most of them are very small. It could facilitate the functioning of the arbitration system and relations generally between employers and unions if this number of unions decreases. I know of situations in which employers have sat across the table with so fewer than 15 unions in relation to one issue. Government departments have bad this experience. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Despite that, the Minister went on to introduce this legislation. Having said all that, he bent the knee-to and kissed the hand, if not worse, of the Democratic Labor Party before doing another shuffle. Proposed section 158n provides that, in order to bring about an amalgamation, at least SO per cent of those on the role of voters must vote and more than 50 per cent of those who vote must vote in favour of an amalgamation. In his speech of 2nd March the Minister pointed out the difficulties of getting a high percentage of members voting. I have already quoted what he said on page -5 of his speech in regard to that matter. At the behest of the Democratic Labor Party he has made it much harder for unions to amalgamate, in spite of what he had to say about the representatives of 15 small unions having been present at a conference in relation to one issue and his statement that that had occurred on many occasions in regard to his Department itself. </para>
        <para>The Minister has admitted that it would be better if there were fewer smaller unions and the smaller unions were to amalgamate. It would be better in regard to industrial relations and it would be better in the interests of the unions themselves because there are too many small unions at the present time. There is a tremendous waste of resources as a result of that. Each union has to have a secretary, typing facilities and an office. The administrative costs are excessive. If unions could amalgamate and there was a bigger body of unions of similar types they could have specialists, they could have an officer dealing with industrial matters and they could have a man dealing with compensation, apart from the administration of those matters which are very necessary. I believe that this amendment unduly interferes with the freedom of trade unions. It was prepared without any consultation with the trade unions. It is a sad case of the Democratic Labor Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. </para>

          <para>- I wish to make just a few very brief observations. I am puzzled as to why proposed section 158h refers to &#39;regulations&#39;. I think it is a pity that there is not some measure of definition. I am not aware of any reason why there cannot be some definition as far as this proposed section is concerned. Turning to proposed section 158l, I suggest to the Minister for Labour and National Service that sub-section (2.) of that proposed section should read &#39;the organisations&#39;; in other words, the plural should be used because it is obvious that 2 organisations are involved in an amalgamation. If the Committee turns back to proposed section 158k it will see that reference is made there to the fact that the Industrial Registrar shall arrange for the conduct in respect of each of the existing organisations concerned. </para>

            <para>- Sub-section (2.) of proposed section 158l. I think that is the neatest way of describing it. Sub-section (2.) of proposed section 158l states that the organisation concerned may deliver to the Industrial Registrar a statement in writing of not more than 2,000 words in support of the amalgamation. Both organisations may want to deliver an argument in favour of the amalgamation and similarly there may be members of both organisations who want to deliver, arguments against it. This may be picked up somewhere else. </para>

        <para>As I understand the remarks of the honourable member for Stirling and some of the other arguments relating to amalgamation which I have heard in. advance, there is objection to the proposed new section 158n, which requires that there shall be at least one-half of the members on the roll who shall vote and there shall be one-half of those members who shall be in favour of the amalgamation. I concede that there is substance in this point of view. The fact is that there is no compulsory voting as far as these provisions are concerned. I must confess that I have always taken the view that compulsory voting has its limitations. We have it in Australia but it would rather be a gesture in the nature or character of Don Quixote to imagine we could do anything about it. We have compulsory voting. </para>
        <para>As far as trade union ballots are concerned and as far as these provisions are concerned there is no compulsory balloting and one apprehends that this could well be  a  weakness. What would happen if there were massive disinterest? What would hap pen if there were a union of say 8,000 members of whom 3,000 voted? They may have powerful views on the issue but the other 5,000 people could not care less. I am sure that this is the common expertence of us all in regard to an election of a member to a committee in large bodies, when people simply do not vote. </para>

            <para>-  I am sorry, &#34;i do not: move in the .select circles in which my honourable friends move. I am sure that the Committee understands the point that I am making. If massive disinterest is shown by the 2 organisations, what happens if the episode is to be repeated? I- think there should be some provision &#62; whereby an appeal may be made to some body. I am sorry that I do not spell this out with a greater sense of definition to the Minister and to the honourable gentlemen assisting him. I feel that the proposed new section 158n could in certain circumstances be very severe and I think there should be some provision so that if .apathy is shown regard will be had for that fact. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough, if not in this chamber then elsewhere, to look at the proposed new section &#39; 158l. I do feel that the word &#39;organisation&#39; should be in the plural. I feel also that there could be provision for the proposer and the prop*see, those who want to join&#39; and those who are to be joined. There may &#39;.be views on both sides. In other words, there could be 4 points of view, so that in .certain circumstances there could be the occasion for the 4 points of view to be circulated. </para>

          <para>- I would like to respond to the points which the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has put before the House. As far as the proposed new section 158l sub-section (2.) is concerned, separate ballots are to be taken by each of the amalgamating organisations and therefore the term is correctly used in the singular. In fact the term in the plural would not be appropriate because of the separate nature of the ballots. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Of course, that must mean the organisation because only one organisation is submitting a &#39;yes&#39; case to the ballot. The other organisations which may be involved in the amalgamation would reach that stage either before or after taking the ballot. So the point I am making here is that there is a separate ballot for each organisation and, therefore, the term must be used in the singular. I apologise to the honourable gentleman; my attention was diverted when he was talking about the question of ballots, so I am not entirely certain which particular point he was querying. </para>

            <para>- If I understand the position which the honourable gentleman places before me, he is querying the situation where for a variety of reasons there may not be a SO per cent vote. The Government has looked at this matter in a most thorough way. It also has had the opportunity of looking at the results of court controlled ballots which show that approximately 50 per cent, as I recall the figure, returned a vote. So on that basis it would be clear that a 50 per cent vote cannot be regarded as an achievement of unusual dimension. I believe it ought to be borne in mind also that this is a vital vote, going as it does to the whole concept of the entity concerned. The Government believes it quite reason able to require a 50 per cent vote before that organisation in fact can be wound up. It ought to be borne in mind also that that 50 per cent is not 50 per cent of those voting in favour; it is simply a 50 per cent vote of the membership at that time, as defined in the provisions of the Bill. The honourable gentleman queried another matter. </para>

I personally know of no agreement in this place in relation to how long a time has been set aside for the debate. My point of order is this: If the Government, the Leader of the House or the Minister at the table is to have the parrot at the back of the chamber move the gag, all I say is that we on this side will do our best to delay it. Why should we not do that? The measure before the House is an absolute disgrace to a national Parliament. </para>

            <para>- This clause makes alterations to the penalties set out in 20 sections of the Act. The penalties in some cases are increased by 150 per cent. In other cases they are increased by 400 per cent. In one other case I can see there is an increase of 200 per cent; another case involves an increase of 500 per cent. In one case I notice r.hat the 500 per cent increase in the monetary penalty is accompanied by a new penalty of imprisonment for 6 months which previously was not there. My colleagues will be glad to know that this is a new penalty of imprisonment which will be imposed upon employers who fail to make their records available to inspectors. What I cannot understand is that the Government has seen fit to retain section 122 in its old form, a form that has remained the same for many years. It says that no person shall wilfully make default in compliance with any order or award. The penalty is $40. That is not the section of the Act that is used to prosecute employees or unions; it is the section of the Act that was incorporated originally to deal with employers who wilfully made default in compliance  with an order or award. The penalty is still only $40. But to get a conviction you have to prove that the employer wilfully committed the offence. On the few occasions that the section has been used to prosecute employers, the prosecutions have usually failed because the prosecution was not able to prove wilful default. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>But let us have a look at the way this Government considers it is proper to deal with unions which commit an offence against section 119 of the Act. The Government says it is quite all right to impose a penalty of $500 a day upon a union, no matter how much the union tries to prevent a strike. Even though the strike is taken against the directions of the union&#39;s executive, that union - not wilful but, on the contrary, doing its best to try to prevent a strike - can be punished by a fine up to $500 a day or $1,000 where the bans clause treats the offence as a single offence. Yet here we have still in the Act this section, which does not refer to employers but which is the section which would have to be used. If the section is no longer of any use - I think that can be said of it - why has the Government not taken the opportunity that this debate now offers to take the section out of the Act altogether? It has not been used for a long time. In fact, with the section 119 already in the Act, whereby it is not necessary to show wilful disobedience, there is no need for it. I would like to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> explain why the section was left there in the present form. If it is not to be altered, why was it not deleted from the Act altogether seeing that section 119 now does the job? I do not have anything more to say about it but the Opposition objects to a procedure which increases the penalties by up to 500 per cent in 20 separate sections, in one clause by way of a schedule attached to the back of the Bill. </para>

          <para>-  I can think of few clauses in the Bill which deserve more than this one does the absolute and utmost condemnation of all fair minded and thinking members of the Committee. I include in that those on the Government side because they have the opportunity tonight to oppose this proposed section and vote with the Opposition. We have a situation continued in this Bill that makes retrospective payment to people in the community who do not deserve it, do not need it and ought not to get it. We have a situation in which every Minister has had questions directed to him over a long period of time in this Parliament in regard to the cost of living, the minimum wage and social services. In fact, you name it, and that question has been posed to Ministers who invariably have got to their feet and said that these problems have been caused by the wage spiral. They have intervened, however much they might say to the contrary, by way of Press statements and publications put out on behalf of the Liberal Party, such as the great rag called the &#39;Australian Liberal&#39;. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member was silly enough to ask the question. He should read it and see. Here is a former industrial officer of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour who has never stood in this place and advocated a wage rise other than for the kind of people who are being benefited by this clause before us tonight. The honourable member and his colleagues have condemned wage and salary increases. Whenever the necessity for such increases has been put to the Government honourable members opposite have opposed them. Answers to questions asked in this chamber regarding rising prices and so forth place the whole blame for rising prices on wage increases. These are blamed for all of the inflation today. Why does not one of the honourable members opposite get to his feet tonight and admit that measures such as this and previous measures that we have had from the Government - and the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> is laughing his head off over there - have been responsible for benefiting the less deserving section of the community. As a result of one such measure a quarter of a million dollars was split up among 57 top public servants, but the Government does not give a damn about the Third Division public servants. It is doing the same sort of thing now with this measure. Why does not one of the honourable members opposite endeavour to convince us that a measure increasing a salary and making the increase retrospective will do something for the economy? Why should this fellow get retrospective payment? What good will he do with it? He is not going to spend it. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I think that when you see the point that the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> was trying to get cleared up you and the Committee will understand why he is insisting upon an answer. Clause 68 of the Bill purports to exempt from the provisions of the Bill, relative to amalgamation procedures, any application for amalgamation that was made before this Bill was put through both Houses. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honourable member for Stirling wants to know whether, in the event of the proceedings now before the Industrial Court going against the amalgamated unions and the Court holding that the application was not properly lodged, and that it therefore was a nullity, and that there was in fact no application legally before the Registrar, this clause will not help them. This clause prescribes that the Act does not apply in relation to an amalgamation in relation to which, before the date of commencement of this section, an application was made to the Registrar in accordance with section 139 of the principal Act. That is all the honourable member wants to clear up. I think that paragraph (c) ought to be inserted to the effect that an application for amalgamation between the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia and the Sheet Metal Workers Union shall be deemed to be an application made in accordance with the  provisions of the principal Act. I am talking off the cuff, but I am sure the Parliamentary Counsel will understand from the Hansard report what I am seeking. </para>
        <para>Unless the Government does this, the amalgamated unions run the risk, after long delays, of being told that this amalgamation, which really sparked off the whole controversy following an attempt by the Government to reach a compromise with the Democratic Labor Party, will not be allowed to proceed. They will be back where they started and they will have to commence their amalgamation procedures right from the beginning, going through the formalities stipulated in the new legislation for amalgamations. It will take 3 times as long to comply with those formalities as it takes to comply with the present requirements of the Act, and it has taken these unions more than 2 years to comply with them. After going through all  that, if the Industrial Court holds that the application was not validly made, it will mean that the application itself was a nullity, that there was no application and that the protection which prima facie this provision gives to the amalgamation processes will come to nothing. </para>
        <para>I think the Minister ought to indicate the position now. I know that already he has the amended Bill in that amended form printed and ready to go to the Senate in the morning. In the Senate he ought to indicate to the Committee that he is prepared to place the position regarding amalgamation beyond any doubt. It must be remembered that one of the judges sitting on the case is not well. He may take a long time to give his decision. There is no way of getting an order of mandamus against a judge of the Industrial Court, and until that judge writes his judgment the whole matter will be delayed and nothing will be brought to fruition. However, if the Government makes it clear that notwithstanding any decision taken by the Industrial Court in the proceedings now before it the amalgamation now under way will be completed, it will not matter how long the Industrial Court takes to deliver its judgment on the point now at issue. In those circumstances the amalgamation would be able to proceed. </para>

            <para>- If the Opposition wants the information which it has sought it will have to keep quiet, otherwise we will finish the debate here and now. Honourable members opposite can please themselves about it. The question of ballots, of course, is subject to challenge before the court at the present time. Therefore, I do not canvass the issues involved, and the extent to which that question will involve the current legislation obviously will be determined by the nature of the judgment which is handed down by the court. But I can say to the honourable gentleman who raised this matter that if the ballots are found to be defective, then it would be found that the requests for deregistration were nor properly made. It is the Government&#39;s intention that those matters should then come within the provisions of the new Act. If that matter is not sufficiently clear- </para>

He and nearly every honourable member on the other side of the House give scant consideration and courtesy to anything out themselves and their own party discipline. This evening the Government has been putting legislation through the Parliament with the leave of the Opposition when such leave is required, but at no point does the Government ever consider anybody but its supporters. When I was sitting in my room a few moments ago I heard the Minister say: &#39;If the Opposition is going to speak like this, I will put the legislation through straight away&#39;. What a wonderful power lies in his hands. It lies there not because he is so powerful but because not one honourable member opposite has one inch of grit, stomach, guts or self reliance.

            <para>- The reason why I have moved dissent from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> is quite obvious. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> apparently does not want to be embarrassed by having to be sat down as members of the Opposition have been sat down on many occasions. The Minister did mention earlier that there was an agreement in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I did not know anything about an agreement. It seems strange to me that the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> spoke on this Bill more than did any other member of the House. Did the honourable member for Moreton know about the agreement? I do not think he did. Had he known about it, probably the gag would have been applied to him. However, the fact is - this is quite, obvious - that the Minister has shown a lot of bias. Of course, he has got that from the Assistant Government Whip, the honourable member for Angas (MrGiles), who has applied the gag to honourable members on this side consistently during the last 2 hours. Why did not he apply the gag to the honourable member for Moreton? Is this patronage? Is it favoritism? Did not the honourable member for Moreton know about this agreement? If he did, he did not keep it. I do not think anybody on this side of the chamber knew anything about the agreement. </para>

          <para>- I second the motion. I do so for reasons similar to those which have already been put. During the course of the debate this evening, honourable members on this side of the House have continually been subjected to what I would refer to as a vicious method of applying the gag by a party which has been in office for too long and which is in some kind of desperation. In addition, when the Opposition sought information on the second last clause of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> took up a lot of time and was reluctant to answer the queries of the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> until he had had a chance to refer to officers of his Department. What reason or rhyme has the Government or the Minister had to carry on in the manner in which they have carried on tonight? Why is it- </para>

I think that the honourable member is getting wide of the mark and I ask him to confine his remarks to the motion now before the Chair. </para>

            <para>- The reason I am on my feet as the seconder to a motion of dissent against your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> is quite obviously the fact that the ruling supports the very thing that the Government has been doing during the course of the debate tonight. That is a good and sufficient reason for seconding this motion. I will say this: You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> do not occupy the chair for a great many hours in any particular parliamentary session and, with all due respect, although this Government has been in office for some 22 years, because of its calibre, as shown tonight, it is still slow to learn. Perhaps its supporters have not learnt the procedures of this House as quickly as others have learnt them. It may be that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> erred tonight in your decision because that you have been under some pressure from your colleagues- </para>

Franki, commonly known as the &#39;fire fighters case&#39;. Members on this side of the House are glad that the Government has extended these provisions to the Commonwealth Territories but regret that similar extension cannot be made to the States. At any rate, it is better to do this than to do nothing and the Opposition will give both Bills a quick passage. They do something we have wanted to do for a long time. </para>

            <para>Statistics supplied in the attached tables are derived principally from surveys of overseas investment and overseas participation conducted by the Commonwealth Statistician and from information used to compile the Australian National Accounts. Descriptions of the statistics on overseas investment and overseas participation are given in the statistical bulletins: &#39;Annual Bulletin of </para>
            <para class="block">Overseas Investment 1969-70&#39; (reference No. 5.20); Oversea Participation in Australian Mining Industry 1968&#39; (reference No. 10.42); &#39;Overseas Participation in Australian Manufacturing Industry 1962-63 and 1966-67, Part I- Overseas Ownership and Part II - Overseas Control&#34; (reference Nos 12.19 and 12.20, respectively). Descriptions of the statistics relating to total investment are set out in the bulletin &#39;Australian National Accounts - National Income and Expenditure 1969-70&#39; (reference No. 7.1). </para>
            <para>Answers to each of the twelve parts of the question are shown in the accompanying Tables A and B, the item numbers used corresponding where possible to the part numbers of the question, or by way of reference to Treasury Economic Paper No. 1, &#39;Overseas Investment in Australia&#39;, May 1972. Many of the questions relate to fields in which precise statistical information is not available. For this reason, it is necessary to apply some degree of judgment in making use of such statistics as are available. The following answers are provided subject to this general reservation. Brief explanatory notes are given below: </para>

                <para>It is not really appropriate to make a comparison between statistical series of overseas investment in Australia and total investment in Australia. The two series measure investment flows of differing natures. Overseas investment in companies in Australia is a measure of the net flow of private financial investment from overseas, which may take the form of acquisition of existing assets and financial claims in addition to the creation of new assets. It also excludes investment by overseas-owned companies from depreciation funds. The national accounting series of total gross investment in Australia, on the other hand, measures the value of physical investment in new real assets only. For what it is worth, however, the ratio of the statistical series of total private overseas investment in companies in Australia to the statistical series of total investment (defined as gross fixed capital expenditure plus the value of physical changes in stocks) is calculated in Item (3). Table A. </para>

                <para>Item (4) of Table A shows the rates of growth of (a) total investment, as defined in (3), and (c) private overseas investment in companies in Australia, for one year over the previous year. Item (4) in Table B shows the percentage growth for the same two categories for the periods 1949-50 to 1959-60, 1959-60 to 1969-70 and 1949-50 to 1969-70. The Statistician does not compile statistics of &#39;local investment&#39; and, for various statistical and conceptual reasons, including those given in (3) above, it is not valid to define and measure such a concept as the difference between gross capital expenditure and overseas investment. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(5)">
                <para>The Statistician has compiled statistics on the industrial classification of direct overseas investment in companies in Australia for 1956-57 and subsequent years. An industrial classification of private overseas investment in the&#39; form of portfolio investment and institutional loans is, however, not compiled. There are no statistics of total investment (as defined in (3) above) classified by industry, but statistics of total gross private fixed capital expenditure in respect of individual sectors of industry are available. Item (5) of Table A shows (a) the major industrial classification of direct overseas investment in companies in Australia in the form of (i) undistributed income and (ii) other direct investment for the period 1956-57 to 1969-70 and (b) the annual rates of growth of (i) total direct overseas investment in companies in Australia classified by major industry groups for the period 1957-58 to 1969-70 and (ii) total gross private fixed capital expenditure classified by major industry groups for the period 1949-50 to 1967-68 (the latest year for which such statistics are available). Item (5) in Table B shows the percentage growth in (a) direct overseas investment in companies in Australia classified by major industry groups for the periods 1956-57 to 1959-60, 1959-60 to 1969-70 and 1956-57 to 1969-70, and (b): total gross private fixed capital expenditure classified by major industry groups for the periods 1949-50 to 1959-60, 1959-60 to 1967-68 and 1949-50 to 1967-68. Because statistics of overseas investment by industry relate only to direct overseas investment and exclude investment from depreciation funds, it is not possible to relate the information supplied in answer to questions (2) and (3) to sectors of industry. </para>

                <para>Statistics of overseas control of Australian industry have been compiled only for the mining and manufacturing sectors and only for a limited number of years, namely calendar years 1963 to 1968 for mining and financial years 1962-63 and 1966-67 for manufacturing. Information on the proportion of overseas control, measured in terms of the value of production, is contained in Item (6) of Table B.

                    <para>and (c) No statistics are compiled on gross profit rates, after tax, for those sectors of industry which are locally controlled and overseas-controlled. However, some approximation of the profitability of that section of industry which is overseascontrolled can be obtained by calculating the earning rates of companies which are directly overseas-owned (as defined for statistical purposes). In addition, some indication of the profitability of locally owned companies can be obtained from Reserve Bank sources. The estimates so obtained are deficient in several respects. Moreover, since they are derived from separate sources, they are not directly comparable. The  available  information is presented on pages 31-35 of Treasury Economic Paper No. 1,Overseas Investment in Australia&#39;. (8)For the purpose of this question, gross profit after tax for industry overall  is  measured by total company income after tax as defined in the bulletin &#39;Australian National Accounts - National Income and Expenditure 1969-70. No statistics are compiled on the gross profits after tax of those sections of industry which are locally and overseas controlled. However, an approximate indication of the gross profits after tax of those sections of industry which are locally and overseas-owned can be obtained by measuring gross profit after tax for overseasowned industry by total company incomeafter tax payable overseas and for locally owned companies by the difference between total company income after tax and total company income after tax payable overseas. Item (8) of . Table A shows the percentage of gross profits after tax retained for (a) all industry, (b) locally owned industry and (c) overseas-owned industry, calculated on the basis of income measurement outlined above.

        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(3)">
            <para>to (7) In some respects, these parts of the question are inappropriate to the training provided under this Scheme, which is practical, on-the-job employment training and does not extend to institutional training or specific established courses. The Scheme provides for subsidies, for a maximum period of 12 months in resspect of each Aborigine, to employers who provide long-term work training (with a minimum period of 12 months) to Aborigines who have been assessed by the Commonwealth Employment Service as having no history of previous employment or inadequate previous employment. The subsidy payable to employers is a diminishing proportion of the award rate for the work in which the Aborigine is being trained (the Scheme applies only to employment in which an award or determination applies or for which there is an established ruling rate). The subsidy is as follows: first 3 months - 30 per cent of award, etc. rate; second three months - 25 per cent of award, etc. rate; third 3 months - 20 per cent of award, etc. rate; fourth 3 months - 10 per cent of award, etc. rate. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Commonwealth and State Departments and instrumentalities are not eligible for subsidy under the Scheme. </para>
        <para>In addition, the Scheme provides for direct benefits to be paid to Aborigines placed in employment by the Commonwealth Employment Service. These benefits, which are not restricted to Aborigines placed in subsidised employment training, consist of payment of fares to take up employment and for junior Aborigines, living away-from-home allowances, payment of the first week&#39;s accommodation costs for those required to live away from home, assistance with daily fares for those living away from home in metropolitan or major employment areas, a clothing grant for those under the age of 17 years entering their first employment and the payment of fares for those juniors living away from home to enable them to return to their families. </para>
        <para>The Scheme has been gathering momentum, reflecting increasing acceptance by employers and Aborigines and the efforts of specialist staff to select and counsel trainees and employers. </para>
        <para>The number of Aborigines placed in subsidised employment training during 1971 was 678, compared with 419 during 1970 and considerably more than double the number of juniors were receiving direct benefits at the end of 1971 (396) than at the end of 1970 (149). </para>
        <para>Since the inception of the Scheme 1,426 Aborigines had been placed in subsidised employment training to end-February 1972, at which time 330 were still in training; 676 juniors had been granted living-away-from-home allowances; fares to take up employment had been paid for 456, both adults and juniors; 212 junior Aborigines had had their return fares paid to visit their families. Since December 1970, the first weeks accommodation costs had been paid for 318 juniors and the clothing grant paid to 212 juniors. </para>
        <para>Through the Scheme the Department has been able to place in employment a substantial number of Aborigines who might not have found employment in the particular industries or occupations in which they were placed or who might not otherwise have found any regular, long-term employment. Certainly the provision of direct benefits to young Aborigines appears to have been a significant factor in encouraging them to enter regular employment, to acquire work skills and in making it possible for them to move voluntarily from areas of no employment potential to areas of industrial activity. </para>
        <para>Placements under the subsidised employment provisions of the Scheme have been in a wide range of occupations and industries. Almost half (45 per cent) of all the placements were in semiskilled work as factory operatives, machinists, and building, metal and electrical workers. Less than one-fifth (19 per cent) of the placements were in unskilled work - and many of those so placed would progress to more skilled work. Well over one-fifth (23 per cent) of all junior males were placed as apprentices or trainees in skilled trades. Almost half (48 per cent) of the junior females were placed as office and sales workers and nursing assistants, while most of the remainder were placed as clothing machinists or other factory workers. </para>
        <para>An analysis, by State and Territory, of the time spent with employers by trainees who terminated their training between 1st July 1970 and 30th June 1971 in the various States and the Northern Territory is set out in the table below. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="078131197205165_109_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>From this table it will be evident that of those whose employment training terminated during 1970-71 half had remained 4 months or longer, including those who completed the full term of training. When it is considered that the Scheme is specifically directed to Aborigines with little or no previous experience of regular employment, the value of involving the 50 per cent who completed more than 4 months in a regular work situation should be stressed. A separate analysis of all those who commenced training in 1970 indicates that 25 per cent completed their 12 months training, which is even more encouraging. </para>

              <para>A reallocation of priorities in planning work being undertaken by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board was effected late in 1971 to advance the finalisation of technical plans for the Stage 7 stations. In the case of a number of the stations proposed for Queensland, a decision was made that the work be contracted on a &#39;turn-key&#39; basis and a Specification and Tender Schedule were produced accordingly as a matter of urgency. Tenders were left open for a period of only eight weeks, which is considerably less than the time normally afforded for tendering. The Tender Schedule was issued early in January 1972 and tender assessment is now nearing completion. For certain stations in South Australia and Western Australia requiring special technical solutions for which normal equipment is not available, it . was decided that Departmental staff would adapt commercial equipment to make it suitable rather than accept the long delays which could be expected if special equipment had to be developed by industry in the usual manner. Furthermore, financial authorisation was obtained as a special measure from the Treasury early in 1972 to enable&#39; ordering of equipment to proceed in advance of finalisation of the budgets for 1972-73 and 1973-74. This is expected to result in an improvement in the equipment delivery situation, particularly with supplies from overseas. </para>

            <para>The following table, based where applicable on information provided by State authorities, shows the average cost of an attendance at an outpatient&#39;s department of a public hospital and the average patient contribution to the cost in each State and Territory for 1970-71. However I should point out to the honourable member that these are of limited value as there are differences between States in the manner of defining outpatients and defining and recording out-patient attendances. There are also differences in the methods of allocation of costs. </para>

              <para>The cost of extending  a  radio telephone service beyond the15 miles radius depends on such factors as whether power is available, the type of country involved, the type of towers required, and the need or otherwise for repeater equipment. Generally, the cost of  a  radio circuit is constant up to a distance of15 miles but beyond15 miles costs can increase, with such increases ranging up to over $4,500. Similarly, the cost of physical line plant can be affected by the size and type of cable or aerial line plant utilised and the type of terrain over which it is provided. For extensions beyond the 15 miles radius cable costs could vary from about $210 to $1,300 per subscriber per mile. </para>

            <para>A satisfactory standard of service can be provided by either radio-telephone, cable or open wire construction.

Where the area is suitable for the radio-telephone solution, it offers advantages from the standpoint of ease of provision. However, the subscribers are required to supply a suitable source of power for charging the battery associated with the radio-telephone service in their premises. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The monthly average for 1972 so far is 9,225 letters. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Virtually all letters require and are given some form of response. Fewer than 5 per cent require  a  fully written answer. Almost without exception, listeners ask that they be sent one or more items which Radio Australia makes available on request These include: Programme Guides, booklets showing how to erect  a  radio antenna for better reception, booklets for use in conjunction with the English language programmes broadcast by Radio Australia, fan card photos of Radio Australia staff, picture postcards of Australia and scripts of past programmes. If all items sought by the listener are available, they are sent by surface mail as soon as possible after receipt of the letter. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Most listeners address their letters to a Radio Australia post office box in Djakarta. The mail is opened in the ABC&#39;s Djakarta office, read, and coded to indicate specific requests. Once a week, the letters are air-freighted to Melbourne, where the process described in the reply to Question (2) begins. When all requests in the letters have been met, they are destroyed. Some letters are replied to in Indonesian language programmes. These include letters asking questions about Australia and on general topics, as well as letters requesting music to be played in the programme listeners&#39; Request&#39;. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>A specific answer is difficult because of the process outlined in the reply to Question (2). Frequently, letters dated 3 months previously are received in Melbourne with letters 10 days old. The delays often seem to occur in the Indonesian postal system. The processing of letters begins within hours of their arrival in Radio Australia&#39;s Melbourne office. Because surface mail is used in the main to send the replies, it could happen that from the time  a  listener writes until he receives  a  reply, up to 6 months could elapse. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>The time lag is not generally excessive. But to minimise the delay in forwarding replies, staff has been appointed in the ABC&#39;s Djakarta office to handle as much mail as possible in Djakarta, and thus speed the answering process. Bulk supplies of items asked for by listeners have been and are being sent to Djakarta for this purpose. In addition, an outside contractor is being engaged in Djakarta to help with some aspects of the operation, particularly the distribution of English language lesson booklets. </para>
