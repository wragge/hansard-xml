        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the &#39;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#39;. Article 25 reads: &#39;Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.&#39; </para>
        <para>Yet, 23 years later, in our country of great national wealth and abundance it is to the nation&#39;s shame that many thousands of our people live in a state of being inconsistent with the dignity and worth of the human person - languishing in poverty and want, neglect and the lack of proper care necessary for their health and well-being. </para>
        <para class="block">We, the undersigned, respectfully draw to your attention that the conscience of the nation is not at ease while the records of our country show that social services are not comparable with that of other advanced countries administering such services, therefore, we call upon the Commonwealth Government to immediately legislate for: </para>

        <para class="block">Mental illness placed in the same position as physical illness. </para>

            <para>- The Government is pursuing a vigorous campaign to sell the aircraft, which at present is known as Project N, and is examining several alternatives to find an experienced sales representative or representatives with a world-wide network of contracts. The Government believes that there is cause for confidence in selling this aircraft. Although it is probable that the aircraft can be sold in lots of one&#39;s and two&#39;s only, the interest which has been shown indicates that it should be possible to sell a considerable number of the aircraft. For that reason it is necessary to find an experienced sales organisation. I hope to be able to announce before very long that one has been found. However, on this point I would say that the Australian aircraft industry has a great opportunity to sell many of these aircraft, provided that it can maintain fairly stable cost of production. As to the second part of the question, honourable members will be aware that the Government has received many suggestions for a name for this aircraft and that competitions have been held by radio stations and newspapers for this purpose. The Government has taken advice about the sort of name that would be more acceptable in the markets to which it looks, namely, in North America and Europe, and has decided that the name of the aircraft should be Nomad. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member&#39;s question refers to the fact that the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia has threatened to withdraw its operators from Australian National Line ships in protest at the use of the ship Echuca&#39; on the run from Melbourne to Tasmania to service that State&#39;s export container trade. As the House may recall, the ANL purchased the &#39;Echuca&#39; specifically for the Melbourne to Tasmania run and provision was made for the use of a radio telephone operator rather than the usual wireless telegraphers - the sort of dit-dit-dit-dash men - that ships traditionally carry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some time last year the members of the Professional Radio Employees Institute went out on strike and, as a result, tied up the ships of the Australian National Line. After a great deal of consultation with all the unions involved it emerged that no other union believed that safety of life at sea was imperilled or that ships were endangered in any way by transferring from wireless operators to radio telephonists. Finally, the &#39;Echuca&#39; was allowed to sail and the National Line ships put to sea on the condition that there was set up a committee consisting of technicians from the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and from, I think, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd, or some other experts in radio, as well as representatives of the unions involved, to study the effect of the use of radio telephony as against wireless operation. </para>
          <para>It has always amazed me that although we can talk by radiotelephone to men on the moon, members of the Professional Radio Employees Institute refuse to believe that we can talk to people half way across Bass Strait without impairing safety. .There has been reasonable peace since the committee was set up. The facts are that the committee is about to report back to me and, I imagine, to the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and to the employer representatives, on the long term use of radio telephonists as against wireless operators. 1 am absolutely staggered to think that the Professional Radio Employees Institute should take strike action at a time, when, shall we say, the umpire is about to make a decision. It seems to me a quite irrational and irresponsible thing to threaten to tie up the Australian National Line ships and to place in jeopardy not only the freight from the island State of Tasmania, with all the troubles that that foreshadows, but also the operations of the overseas ships of the Australian National Line. </para>
          <para>It has taken us years, of course, to get back into the overseas shipping business and now, by some irresponsible action on the part of one union, we can see the possibility of all the ships of the Australian National Line being tied up. I deplore the attitude that has been taken by the Professional Radio Employees Institute on this occasion. I think it is totally deplorable and quite irresponsible. I cannot use strong enough words to describe it. </para>

Some weeks ago, I think in answer to a question from the Opposition, the Minister indicated that he hoped to introduce a system whereby naval personnel could get a full discharge by giving 18 months notice. How is this plan developing? How will this affect the numerical strength of the Service, especially of senior personnel? </para>

            <para>- It is quite right that a few weeks ago I was asked a question about this matter - I think by the honourable member for Sydney - and I indicated that I had hopes that a scheme of free discharge, after giving 18 months notice subsequent to certain requirements of return of service being fulfilled, could be instituted. I am happy to say that agreement has been reached on this scheme and it will be announced in the course of a few days. The details of the scheme, roughly speaking, are that a junior recruit now entering the Navy at ISi years of age at HMAS &#39;Leeuwin&#39; will not be required to serve the full 12 years of his engagement. He will have to fulfil a minimum requirement of <inline font-style="italic">4i</inline> years service. As to the effect on the numbers borne in the Service, of course the basic idea behind it is to make the Service more attractive as a career for young men. It is hoped that this scheme will improve the enlistment rate, which is not entirely satisfactory at the moment. Nevertheless there are indications that the naval service is being seen as more and more attractive. The re-entry rate has risen by over 100 per cent in recent months. Re-engagements of senior sailors are running at the rate of about 70 per cent which is, as everyone will appreciate, a very high figure. 1 will not be satisfied until I see the institution of a scheme whereby sailors can enter the Service for a lifetime career, not simply for stipulated periods of 12 years or 9 years. The scheme would envisage their being able to remain in the Navy throughout their working life with the possibility of discharge after 18 months notice, which would be the minimum requirement. I believe that this will make the Navy still more attractive and will increase the numbers rather than otherwise. </para>

            <para>- I direct to the Minister for Primary Industry a question concerning a national fruit marketing authority. 1 remind the Minister that on the 28th September last year the Prime Minister told the honourable member for Franklin that he had referred a communication from the then Premier of Tasmania regarding the establishment of a single national fruit marketing authority to the Minister for Primary Industry. As many growers in my electorate are interested in this question, when does the Minister expect to be in a position to indicate what the Commonwealth&#39;s attitude is likely to be? </para>

            <para>- As I have explained in this House and elsewhere, there have been very real problems in the horticultural sector of primary industry. It is true that there have been discussions at various levels about the way the industry could be helped. In addition, following the submission of the report by Professor Grant to the previous Tasmanian Government to the Commonwealth Government a representation was made concerning the constitution of either a national export board or an Australian marketing board. As a third alternative the Tasmanian Government itself was to consider the constitution of a State board. At this stage I have, through consultations with the Apple and Pear Board and with others in the industry, been able to identify a few of the particular areas where perhaps further assistance is needed. As the honourable gentleman knows, rising freight rates have been one of the particular problems that the industry has faced on export markets. This, in conjunction with the problems of excess production in some sectors of the industry, and declining market opportunities, have placed the whole industry in a very difficult position. At the moment a CommonwealthState committee of officials is examining the alternatives available. Discussions are to be held shortly with State Ministers on some aspects relating to canned deciduous fruits. The whole area is still under active deliberation by the Commonwealth and the States. Unfortunately it is not an area which lends itself to easy solutions. Nonetheless I recognise and the Government recognises the quite critical problem that faces many growers in this area and we are doing all we can to ensure that in respect of the complex arrangements that exist on a Federal basis between the Commonwealth and the States everything that we can do will be expedited. </para>

            <para>- The planning stage for the development of the new port of Darwin was completed last year. As the honourable gentleman is aware, the case had been examined by the Public Works Committee and it was shortly thereafter that there was a downturn in the steel industry throughout the world. This caused a falling off in the estimated additional requirements for iron ore from Frances Creek in the Northern Territory. Because this was one of the keys to the major bulk facility development at East Arm this meant that the matter had to be reviewed. So we called upon the steering committee to review the situation there. It has been considering proposals in relation to not proceeding with the bulk facility at East Arm but to proceeding with continued use of the existing facility which is in the main harbour area, and also to provide some additional permanent normal loading facilities in the main harbour itself. These proposals, of course, will not be as costly, but they will include the major facility for normal cargo handling and the small ship facility. The bulk loading facility will only be deferred until such time as there is an upturn in the world steel industry and the demand for iron ore increases. We expect that additional contracts would then be available to the producing company in the Northern Territory. At the present time the steering committee has come up with 2 alternative proposals. We are in the process of examining those at the moment and I do hope that my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, and I will be in a position to make an anouncement regarding this in a matter of the next month or so. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Does he agree that control of the volume of money and credit is the prime function of a national government? Has he noted that in the last 20 years control of money and credit through the Reserve Bank of Australia and the orthodox banking system has dropped from nearly 70 per cent to less than 46 per cent? To what extent has the para-banking system, particularly merchant banks, contributed to this? What action does his Government propose in respect of the excessive inflow of overseas funds which have swollen Australian exchange reserves to a dangerously high level? </para>

            <para>- &#39;My question is directed to the Prime Minister and concerns a proposal for a housing finance scheme for servicemen. Does the Prime Minister recall assuring the House when replying to a question 6 months ago &#39;by the honourable member for La Trobe that the Minister for Housing had already presented a submission for the setting up of a home finance scheme for members of the regular forces? Did the Prime Minister assure the House also that Cabinet would consider the submission on that same day? What was the Cabinet decision on this question? When was it made and when can servicemen expect to derive benefit from that Cabinet decision? </para>

Is he aware that Crest Mills has been ordered by the New South Wales Maritime Services Board to quit its water frontage property on Monday despite its having contracts to provide binding needed for the manufacture of 220,000 sausages in Tasmania, soya products for Queensland and flour for the Northern Territory?

            <para>-I shall answer the question. Some comment was made by a correspondent about this subject. I do not know from where he got his information, but he made a quite unnecessary statement that is causing unnecessary anxiety among some of the people in the Australian dairying industry. Last week I had talks with the New Zealand Minister for Overseas Trade and following those talks I joined him in issuing a statement saying that we would endeavour to set up a Government and industry panel to promote co-operation and the exchange of information on mar keting in third markets. To avoid any cutthroat competition or confusion in the market it was agreed that there would be a very close understanding between the 2 Governments. With Britain going into the European Common Market and with the likelihood of both Australia and New Zealand having difficulty in disposing of their excess production, it is quite vital that we work more closely together. But a suggestion that we would cut our production back for the benefit of New Zealand is quite wrong. We have been aiming to create a mechanism whereby Australia would be able to control her situation if we got into difficult marketing circumstances. That is what the Minister for Primary Industry has been endeavouring to do, and I hope that he will come to some arrangement and agreement with the industry before long. There has also been some rumour, a mischievous rumour, that New Zealand might hope to get dairy pro, ducts - butter - into Australia. Anybody who talks this way does not understand the stabilisation and orderly marketing system in this country, which could not allow any imports to necessitate still further exports to other markets. Our orderly marketing arrangements are complicated. They depend on complementary legislation of all State governments. </para>

              <para>- It is not my custom to give Dorothy Dix questions out for people to ask me, and this one is not such a question either. However, I can understand the honourable member for Murray, who comes from one of the best dairying electorates in Australia, being very interested in and concerned about this subject. Thank goodness there are a few members in this House who display an interest in the topic. I do want to assure the Australian industry that the New Zealand Ministers understand our domestic marketing arrangements. They know that there is no possibility of New Zealand butter being sold on this market while we arc a major butter exporter, and it would not make sense to displace Australian buller merely to put more on the export market. </para>

I am delighted that the honourable member is now taking a belated interest in the subject. I have received various deputations on this matter and I point out to the House that the honourable member has not been on any of them, nor has he sought to lead one. I say that as justification for my comment. I have informed members of the deputations that no decision will be taken about the use of concrete sleepers by Commonwealth Railways until the Bureau of Transport Economics reports to me on an economic evaluation it is making of the use of concrete sleepers vis-a-vis timber sleepers. No decision will be taken on the tenders that have been let until such time as that evaluation is available to me so that a proper judgment can be made on the subject. </para>

            <para>- The Department of Supply deals with the United States space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, on behalf of the Government. There are at present no approved programmes for the period between the end of America&#39;s ambitious Skylab project, which will be complete by the end of next year, and the first orbit of the space shuttle project, which will not be before 1978. NASA has advised that it has under consideration a number of changes brought about by its changed activity in space. It is in the process of amalgamating 2 specialist networks - that which supports manned satellites and that which supports unmanned earth satellites - and this, on a world-wide basis, will lead to a reduction in the number of tracking stations from, I believe, some 23 or 25 to about 15. The Honeysuckle Creek tracking station will be converted to a deep space station as part of the deep space network and this will lead eventually to the closing down of the Island Lagoon tracking station, which is a sort distance from Woomera. As regards Carnarvon - and these plans by NASA are tentative - it is expected that there will be a diminution of activity there after 1974. Up to that time it will be supporting the Sky Lab programme and will be taking information from the packages which have been left on the moon. It is an important station for the first orbit of manned vehicles which are put into orbit from Cape Kennedy and is expected to have a role there up to 1974 or 1975. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I know that there has been a great deal of concern about this matter. As I have said, the position is that these are only tentative plans by NASA. I had to consider whether, in view of the fact that they are only tentative, this information ought to be disclosed. It was thought that such information as could be disclosed should be made available to the contractors and, of course, to their employees. So high level consultations and discussions are going on in respect of this matter. I will do my best to see that information, when it becomes more specific, is given to them. I would like to add that the recent announcement of a possible cooperative effort between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has not yet been taken into account in these discussions because, as yet, there is not sufficient information on it. </para>

The right honourable gentleman doubtless has taken the opportunity, since my reminder at question time last Thursday, to follow up the instruction he gave Treasury officers after a question to him by the honourable member for Canning 5 week earlier, to seek final census results from the Commonwealth Statistician. As the Statistician had advised the Chief Electoral Officer on 7th December last that final population totals were most unlikely to vary significantly from the preliminary results published on 25th October I ask him what he has found to be the reason for the delay in taking action to ensure that Western Australia gains the additional electorate to which it is entitled in the next Parliament and that all States have electorates based on the current population. </para>

            <para>- I took this matter up with the Commonwealth Statistician through the relevant Minister and I was advised that unless other very important work was set to one side it would be extremely difficult to get this matter through. I believe it is correct to say that it would be difficult to get it through within the period relevant to the purpose mentioned by the honourable gentleman. Nevertheless, I will have a further inquiry made today, but I think he will find that it is probably now too late to be able to take action. I will find out from the Statistician through the Minister himself. </para>

            <para>- I have not received any official advice along the lines suggested by the honourable gentleman but I have certainly seen a Press report indicating that such a study would be carried out by the College. The position in relation to childcare centres, which has been made clear in recent days by the Prime Minister, is that this has been the subject of detailed consultations in recent months by the Government with Commonwealth and State government departments and also with a diverse series of voluntary agencies involved in this field. That research having been completed, the matter is now before the Government, and a decision will be taken in due course. But I can assure the honourable gentleman that, so far as the research which is available to me from my Department is concerned, there is no evidence which points to the fact that children of working mothers are necessarily more prone than others to juvenile delinquency, psychological problems or any form of disturbance of the type that I recall the honourable gentleman suggested. As the Prime Minister recently made clear, there is an absence of child-care centres in Australia at present. The last figures which were taken out late in 1969 indicated that of approximately one quarter of a million children under the age of 6 whose mothers worked only 7 per cent were in registered child-care centres. The matter is before the Government. It would not be proper for me to make any indication of any forward intention, and certainly I will not do so. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. If Ampol Petroleum Ltd succeeds with its takeover bid for R. W. Miller Ltd, will this mean that all tankers operating on the coast will then be owned by oil companies, having in mind that Howard Smith Ltd has a substantial interest in oil through its shareholdings in the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and Esso, besides being the managing agents for Caltex? Does R. W. Miller Pty Ltd, the only Australian independent tanker operator, own 23.7 per cent of the Australian tanker fleet and does this compare very badly with overseas countries where independent tanker operators own 63.8 per cent of the world tanker fleet? If this takeover is successful, will the oil companies then be in a position to falsify their freight charges and illegally establish a case for a price increase in petroleum products? Finally, is it in the best interests of the Australian economy for all tankers to be owned by oil companies? If not, what action does the Government propose to take to prevent this creation of a monopoly? </para>

The answer to the main part of the honourable member&#39;s question rs no; there will not be a monopoly created because Howard Smith is an independent operator. </para>

            <para>- 1 understand that there has been a strike of Japanese seamen since about 5th May. The honourable member asked about the effect that this strike has had on the iron ore and coal industries. In the first place, about 50 per cent of coal is carried by Japanese flag operators and about 50 per cent under flags of other foreign operators. My understanding is that the coal companies are able to stockpile sufficiently and to clear stockpiles with ships that are now operating. Therefore, they are not yet seriously embarrassed by the strike. Insofar as iron ore is concerned, I understand that all the companies are stockpiling. There has been some difficulty for one company but I am told that only in the last few days 2 foreign flag ships called to load iron ore and this is relieving that company&#39;s situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The companies have invoked a force majeure clause which releases them from their contractual obligations. But as best as 1 can make out no real trouble has yet been created for either the iron ore or coal companies. So far as the last part of the honourable member&#39;s question is concerned, the cartage of iron ore and coal is arranged on f.o.b. contracts by Japanese importers and therefore the use of ships is very much a matter for the importers themselves. They would have to pay regard to the situation of the Japanese seamen being on strike and the political or industrial repercussions if they tried to use other flag operators as well. </para>

              <para>- Is it correct as stated in a letter to the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; from the headmasters of private schools that Melbourne Grammar School will receive $280,000 per annum under the scheme for assistance for non-state schools announced recently by the Prime Minister? Is the Minister aware that the approximate cost of conducting an average state high school in Victoria of 800 to 900 students is about $220,000 per annum? I have calculated that figure from a school with which I am closely associated. How can he justify paying out a larger amount of public money to private institutions which accept no public responsibility than it takes to maintain an equivalent state high school? </para>

            <para>- I find it hard to believe that the honourable gentleman does not know that the payments to independent schools will be based upon enrolments and that the only way in which a payment to a particular independent school could be greater than that made for a particular state high school would be if that independent school had a very much greater enrolment than the state high school. Under the proposals which for its part the Commonwealth has adopted and in which the Prime Minister has suggested the Premiers should join - one State has indicated its firm intention to agree to this proposal and at least two others have shown a keen interest - the Commonwealth has proposed that 40 per cent of the cost of education in a government primary school or secondary school should be made available to all independent schools. </para>

The calculations are based on the number ot enrolments. They will be based on a percentage of cost of education in government primary or secondary schools. If the criticism which has been made about the 8 schools which certain people attended is to be taken as meaning that other independent schools with equivalent fee levels would receive no support from the Government, under the policy of the Opposition 32 per cent of all pupils attending secondary schools which provide education to a full matriculation standard would be excluded from any government support. </para>

            <para>- In answer to this unexpected question, it should be made quite clear that co-operation in the field of housing between the Commonwealth and the States has remained a cornerstone of Australian housing policy. It should remain the cornerstone of Australian housing policy if anything meaningful is to be done to house the Australian people and to maintain the standards to which they have been accustomed. It is also clear that co-operation between the States in this field is mirrored by the co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in the whole field of financial policy.

            <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Order of the Day No. 11, Government business, for the consideration of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1971 being called on forthwith and having precedence until disposed of. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">When this motion is agreed to I will move similar motions in respect of the Senate Elections Bill 1971 and the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Bill 1971. On 31st March 1971 - exactly 14 months ago today - the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Hunt) introduced the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1971 and 2 complementary Bills, namely, the Senate Elections Bill 1971 and the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Bill 1971. These Bills still remain on the business paper and no effort has been made by the Government to proceed with the debate on them. </para>
          <para>Another Bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1971 (No. 2), which I introduced on behalf of the Opposition on 1st April 1971, still remains undebated on the notice paper. As there is little chance of the Government supporting a motion to debate the Opposition&#39;s Bill, I move this motion in the hope that the Government, or at least the Liberal Party, will support the motion to debate its own legislation. In the course of his second reading speech the Minister stated that the purpose of the Bill was to effect changes in the Commonwealth Electoral Act to improve voting facilities for electors. He further stated that a review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and regulations had been in progress prior to the 1969 House of Representatives elections, and that the proposed amendments incorporated in the Bill were the result of that inquiry. </para>
          <para>This Bill is a product of investigations which commenced prior to the 1969 elections - more than 3 years ago - and after lengthy investigation and preparation it was introduced 14 months ago, yet the Government, for some mysterious reason, will not proceed with the debate. It is a most important Bill affecting the democratic processes in Australia. It must be assumed that the Government approved of the Bill and was ready to proceed with it at the time of its introduction. Why then the delay? This is the reason I am moving this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. If the legislation is not debated today it will not be debated for some months - until the Budget session - or probably not at all. The Opposition considers that it has a responsibility in seeking to have this Bill debated, amended and enacted prior to the coming Federal elections. We will be happy to assist the Government to debate its own legislation and, at the same time, we will seek to move appropriate amendments in line with Labor Party policy and with the needs of the nation. </para>
          <para>What sinister reason prevents the Government from allowing the Parliament to debate this important Bill? 1 suggest a few reasons for the delay. They are the reasons which have prompted me to move this motion. At about the time of the introduction of the Bill, fierce jungle warfare broke out in the Queensland State Parliament between members of the Liberal Party and members of the Country Party over the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries. It produced unprecedented scenes and events in the Queensland Parliament, even carrying to this chamber. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter),</inline> speaking of certain Liberals who crossed the floor to vote against the Country Party&#39;s greatest gerrymander of all time, spoke in these terms: </para>

              <para>- 1 realise that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I was just making passing reference to the reason why the House is not being allowed to debate this Bill. At the time to which I was referring, desperate words were spoken by desperate Country Party members opposite who were prepared to use every known device to stop the democratic processes which would enable this legislation to be enacted. If the debate had proceeded in this Parliament at that time - this is another reason why we want it to proceed today - members of the Opposition would have exposed to the Australian people, particularly those in Queensland, the pressure that the Country Party exerts on electoral reform in this and other parliaments. This is why we believe that my motion will be opposed. The Country Party has indicated that, at all costs, it will not support the Government&#39;s legislation. The results of the Queensland elections held last Saturday show that members of the Country Party have good reason for delaying this legislation. On Saturday last in Queensland the Country Party, which secured only 19 per cent of the total votes recorded, is now the premier party in that State. The combined Liberal and Country Parties gained 56,000 votes fewer than the Labor Party, yet the coalition is in government. That is one reason why today it is important for the Parliament to consider this legislation. We should be able to debate it and amend it in order to prevent gerrymandering and the prostitution of democracy by the Country Party and others who sit opposite. I believe they have a good reason for not wanting to debate it today, particularly in view of the Queensland election results. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another factor - I raise these points because they are important - could be the disunity that exists in regard to this legislation. People know that there is disunity in the Government Parties concerning the continental shelf, the wool industry, decentralisation and leadership. </para>

              <para>- I mention this aspect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to show that there must be some reason why my motion will be opposed and the debate not proceed. I ask: Is there electoral disunity on this question? It is a strange thing, but it is the Government&#39;s own legislation that we seek to have debated. The legislation had been investigated and was introduced to the Parliament by a Country Party Minister. It has remained on the notice paper for 14 months. Something must be wrong when this is the situation and that is why I seek to have the Bill debated. The Commonwealth Electoral Act needs reform more than any other Act in the nation. A Federal election is pending. In addition to the reforms incorporated in the Bill, some of which the Labor Party supports, the Labor Party seeks to review completely the Act to provide for other reforms. This cannot be done unless my motion is carried. In addition to some of the proposals in the Bill which are good the Labor Party would like to see incorporated in the Act before the next Federal elections provision to enable 18-year olds to vote. Additionally the Labor Party would like to see equality of population in the various Federal electorates and &#39;one man one vote&#39;. Further the Labor Party would like to see provision made in the Australian Capital Territory for an additional member of the House of Representatives and for senators. The Labor Party would like to see the designation of Party affiliation on ballot papers. Also the Labor Party would like to see written into the Act a complete negation of gerrymandering processes that are part and parcel of Country Party representation and policy in Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>as a member of the Liberal Party, you know that in Queensland the Liberal leader should be the Premier. Country Party members have prevented that and they seek now to prevent debate on legislation in this House. I say that it should be debated. It is significant how silent members of the Country Party are on this issue. They will probably have a Liberal Party Minister defend their stance because they know that what I say is true. The Country Party might well consider changing its name to &#39;The Party for Gerrymanders&#39;. Does the Government intend to deny the people the reforms necessary to bring the Commonwealth Electoral Act into line with modern-day thinking in all democratic countries? Because of the delay, the evasion and the complete failure of the Government to take this legislation beyond the second reading stage, one may well be entitled to say that the Government, and particularly the Country Party section of it, is opposed to reform of the Electoral Act, even by its own legislation. 1 move for the suspension of Standing Orders for the reasons I have mentioned. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have curtailed my activities somewhat, but I think I have made my message clear. There can be no excuse for a delay of 14 months in debating proposals which were instigated prior to 1969 and which have remained on the notice paper for so long. The Opposition believes that this delay is another step in the Country Party&#39;s well-known policy of denying all the principles applying to democratic elections. The delay must be taken as an indication that it is intended, if at all possible, to gerrymander the Australian electorates to the advantage of the minority group - the Australian Country Party - and to prevent electoral reform and its effect on the democratic functions in Australia. The delay in presenting the Commonwealth Electoral Bill and the Senate Elections Bill and carrying them through to completion is scandalous and inexcusable. They should be debated and that is why I move for the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- I second the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> because it is an urgent necessity to suspend the Standing Orders to give effect to the sentiments expressed in his second reading speech by the Minister for the Interior {Mr Hunt) on 31st March 1971. I draw attention to the first paragraph of the Minister&#39;s speech when, by way of apology for the late introduction of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, he said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>During the last session of the previous Parliament, the then Minister informed the House that a review of the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Regulations thereunder had been in progress for some time, and that, although it was not possible to reach the point where amendments to the Act could be presented to the Parliament for consideration before the 1969 House of Representatives election, the Government&#39;s intention was that the review should be resumed immediately after the elections and taken to finality as soon as possible. </para>

          <para class="block">I emphasise the words &#39;as soon as possible&#39;. The Minister continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">This has been done and the amendments we propose are the subject of this Bill. </para>
            <para>While certain of the proposed amendments are formal or machinery in character and need little or no explanation, other provisions of the Bill seek to bring about much needed changes in the electoral laws- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise &#39;much needed changes in the electoral laws&#39; -  and it is to these that I will devote most of my remarks. </para>
          <para class="block">I support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders because the Labor Party agrees with the urgency conveyed by the Minister in his speech on 31st March 1971. We had reached the stage where the Minister said that a review had been commenced during the previous Parliament and he was bringing in this legislation halfway during the last Parliament. Shortly we will go into recess and will return for a short Budget session. This will be followed by the Federal elections later this year. If we do not take the action which has been advocated by the honourable member for Grayndler in his motion, consideration of matters which the Government regarded as vital in March 1971, and which the Labor Party regarded as vital then and still does now, will probably not and almost certainly not be given by the Parliament until after the next elections. </para>
          <para>The question arises whether this matter is urgent. The Government proposes to extend absent voting facilities on an Australia wide basis so that an elector can vote outside the State or Territory for which he is enrolled. The Minister in his second reading speech explained that there were anomalies and that voters were unable to exercise the franchise as was their right. Apparently the Government considered that to be urgent in March 1971 but it is not given urgent consideration today. A further proposal of the Bill - the Labor Party will support this one - is to improve voting facilities for patients and inmates of hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, and to enable mobile booths to be established at convalescent homes and hospitals. In March 1971 the Government regarded this as urgent. The Minister in his second reading speech said that it was a matter of great importance that the law should be amended in this way. Therefore the Opposition is advocating the suspension of the Standing Orders today in order that effect might be given to the proposed amendments. The Bill also proposed to tidy up a number of other matters. They include the matter of people who lose their franchise when they are posted overseas; the removal of a person&#39;s name from the roll although he has not ceased to live permanently in the subdivision for which he is enrolled; the eligibility of a member of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to nominate for election as a senator or a member of the House of Reprsentatives; and electoral expenses, a matter on which the Labor Party has some very sound and profound views. </para>
          <para>For those reasons, for the reasons stated by the Minister in his second reading speech which was made a long time ago, in March 1971, and also because the Labor Party wishes to take an opportunity to move amendments to this Bill in line with Labor Party policy to reform the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make our franchise more democratic, to extend the franchise to 18-year-olds and to ensure that the electoral system is run as honestly and efficiently as it may be run, I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Grayndler for the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- It is rather strange for this matter to be raised now because I understand the Opposition has indicated to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that it has for discussion a matter of public importance to be introduced by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> We are now in a curious position because we take it that that matter is not so urgent after all seeing that the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> has taken precedence and has proceeded with an obvious move to delay the business of the House, firstly, in having an opportunity to debate the matter of public importance, which we now understand cannot be so urgent after all, and I suspect therefore that the Opposition would not wish to proceed with that matter, and secondly, because the honourable member for Grayndler knows full well that the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> who handles these matters and who introduced these Bills, is this week in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory attending government conferences. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member knows also that this motion is designed only to try to interfere with a debate on the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill which we expect will be received from the Senate very shortly. These things are, of course, well known and this motion is obviously too blatant an attempt by the Opposition to firstly, delay the business of the House and, secondly, to try to take control of the business of the House which has been laid down by the Government. In these circumstances and in view of the arguments that have been put by the 2 Opposition members who spoke to the motion - those arguments were almost facetious in their intent, the comments in most cases being completely irrelevant and dealing with matters other than those relating to the Electoral Bill - this also is an obvious indication of the intention of certain members of the Opposition to try to delay the business of the House by moving this motion. </para>

My point is that the Minister said we did not speak to the the Bill. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> should take action on that.  1  take his remarks as a reflection on you because I know full well that you keep all speakers within the provisions of Standing Orders. Therefore I would like you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to reprove the Minister for the remarks he made which, although they did not reflect so much on me, reflect on you. </para>

            <para>- I do. During question time the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> attributed words to me which I said were false. Even after my drawing his attention to the fact that they were false he continued to make further accusations. I point out that standing order 76 provides that all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on members shall be considered highly disorderly. I repeat that the words attributed to me by the Minister during question time were false, lt is regrettable that the Minister may use question time in this House to get down to gutter politics because of his precarious position in retaining his seat. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr UREN</inline>(Reid)- As a further persona&#93; explanation, I point out that the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> misrepresented me when he said that I made these utterances in a speech at Sydney University. I would be prepared, if I am given the time, to go to my office and obtain copies of the speeches I have made at Sydney University, and to table them in this House. It so happens that each time I present papers or address gatherings at universities my speeches are prepared and they are distributed to the Press before I deliver them. I will therefore go up to my office, with your permission, get the document and table it. The Minister says the speech was made on 29th April? </para>

            <para>- I understand from discussions with honourable members opposite that the amendments bearing the numbers that I have read to the Committee, which therefore are the subject of this motion, will be the subject of debate by members of the Opposition, but will not be the subject of a division. At a later hour of this day 1 will move separately in relation to the 2 amendments, Nos 1 and 7, which the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> has foreshadowed to me will be the subject of a division. The amendments that have been specified in the motion have in fact been the subject of canvass in the Senate already. It would not be my intention at this stage to go over again ground that has already been covered in that place. Therefore I have simply moved that amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 be agreed to. That is in accordance with the understanding which I made with the honourable member for Stirling. </para>

          <para>- We agreed to take these amendments as the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has suggested. There are 2 amendments made by the Senate on which we want a vote; they are Nos 1 and 7. However, at the moment the Committee is dealing with the other amendments, and I want to pass some comments on them although we do not intend to vote against them. I will explain the reasons. Let us take clause 12, for example, which is amendment No. 3. Of course, the Labor Party opposed the clause in this place as it proposed giving commissioners an increase in salary to $16,250. It was opposed also in the Senate, and the result is that the salaries of the commissioners remain as they are at present, and the Government has now accepted that situation. Even some Government Senators voted against increasing the salaries of the commissioners while the Government was keeping down the salaries of others. Of course, the Government has got its desserts. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The commissioners are already in receipt of a salary of $11,800, and it was intended to give them an increase of $4,450 per annum, and to make the payment retrospective to 4th November 1971. These are the men who increased the minimum wage by $4.70 only a few weeks ago and gave tradesmen a miserable increase of $2 a week. The Government tries to adopt a double standard, as is clear when one looks at the legislation now before the House. It is willing, in fact, to grease the fatted pig. The Government has 2 standards. It goes before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and argues that in the interests of the national economy the wages of the workers must be kept down, and it uses all the forces of the machinery at its command to do this. Then it proposes to give these large increases to persons on very high incomes. </para>
        <para>I point out to honourable members, as I have done before, that if the workers want their wrongs righted, they must produce witnesses, must call evidence, and must prove conclusively that their claim is justified. Even then the Commission can refuse to grant those just claims if to do so would not be in the public interest, in accordance with the Commission&#39;s interpretation of the public interest. Employers, on the other hand, can raise prices at their own whim and fancy. They do this in the secrecy of the board room without any thought for the public interest or without calling witnesses to give evidence. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and the Minister for Labour and National Service lay the blame for increased prices on the workers and on their demands for increased wages to meet increased costs of living. Yet they will do nothing about prices. &#39;Public interest&#39; has been expanded in this amending Bill to take into account the state of the economy. </para>
        <para>I ask the Government: Did it take into account the state of the economy when Broken Hill Pty Company Ltd recently increased steel prices by <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent and in some instances, particularly in regard to building materials, caused price rises of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent? No charge is ever made by the Government that such companies are taking too much of the national income, thereby endangering the economy and causing living costs to rise. Is it any wonder that the workers take direct action and threaten to withdraw from arbitration and to rely on negotiation to have their wrongs righted? The Government is even trying to interfere at the present stage in the waterside workers case. The worker has never been in a worse position financially than he is in today. At one time the worker&#39;s wage was adequate to meet the ordinary financial needs of the home. Today no worker and his family can live on the base wage. Consequently, he has to have 2 jobs or work overtime or his wife must work in order to make ends meet. That is the situation in which families find themselves these days. </para>
        <para>The Government supports an increase of $4,250 a year, or about $84 a week, retrospective to November 1971 for certain statutory office holders while at the same time it adds sections to the Act to lessen the workers&#39; chances of getting increases which may be approved by the employers. I instance again the intervention that is presently taking place in the watersiders&#39; case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Government wants to stop employers and employees reaching amicable agreements on wage claims. The Opposition opposes strongly any suggestion of a wage freeze. It believes in the 2 main principles of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which are to promote goodwill in industry and to encourage conciliation with a view to amicable agreement, thereby preventing and settling industrial disputes. Unfortunately, this Government seems to have lost track of those principles. The amendments since the Act was initiated in 1904, whether they were entirely satisfactory or not, had a set purpose - to try to improve those principles. But this Government seems to have got away from that. </para>
        <para>This amending Bill works in the other direction. It is purely political. No attempt is made to improve the Act in line with the thinking of the trade union movement and the more advanced employers. In fact, its aim is to create dissension in the community for political purposes. Before the Minister for Labour and National Service brought down the December 1971 statement of intent, meetings had taken place between the employers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to investigate ways in which the Act might work more smoothly. A lot of progress was made in 1971 and a satisfactory stage of agreement had been reached between the parties. It was at this stage that the Minister stepped in and refused to accept the understanding that had been arrived at. What had been achieved by the unions and the employers was sabotaged by this Government. All that the Minister would do, following on earlier successful meetings, was to hear views, but he would not enter into worthwhile discussions. After hearing the views he said he would consider them. The next move was the statement of intent. The attitude of the unions was not even considered when that took place. Then this Bill was introduced. </para>
        <para>The other clause on which I wish to comment briefly is clause 41. I draw attention to the fact that this deals with the exercise of the court&#39;s jurisdiction. The Australian Labor Party moved an amendment in the Senate to the Government&#39;s </para>
        <para class="block">Bill. I do not want to quote it all but I think that some extract from it would be worth while. The amendment is headed Exercise of Court&#39;s jurisdiction&#39;. It was moved to improve the workings of the Act as far as we could see it. A further amendment proposed by the Senate was accepted by the Australian Labor Party Opposition in the Senate, and consequently the amendment to which I have referred was withdrawn. The Opposition does not oppose the amendment as it now appears. I will leave it at that. I have expressed my views on these matters. The Opposition does not intend to call a vote on the matter. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition intends to oppose both the amendments to which the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has referred. I draw attention to the fact that when this Bill was before the House and the matter was being debated clause 2 read: </para>
        </talk.start></continue><list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="2.">
            <para>- (1.) The following provisions of this Act shall come into operation on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent - </para>
          </item>
        </list><para class="block">Then it numbered all the clauses, including the clauses which are now in dispute. When this matter was before the Senate the following sub-clauses were proposed to be inserted: (2.) Sections 41, 49 and 53 of this Act shall come into operation on such respective dates as are fixed by Proclamation. (2a.) Sections 51 and 68 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the twenty-sixth day of May, One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. </para><para class="block">The amendment from the Senate backdates the operation of 2 vital sections of this Act to 26th May 1972. That is why we are opposing it. Let me explain the reasons why. </para><para>These are the sections dealing with amalgamation of organisations. It will be remembered that when the debate was taking place here in Committee I raised the question under clause 68 as to whether it affected the amalgamation of the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, the Sheet Metalworkers Union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union which was in process at the time. These unions had been working on this amalgamation for a period of about 3i years and had almost completed the necessary procedures. The House will remember that the Minister was very reluctant to answer the question I put to him. He said that section 68 was a mere tidying up. It was clear that the Minister was hiding something - in my opinion anyhow and, I think, in the opinion of some other members of the House - and that the aim was to prevent if possible the amalgamation taking place. Finally, after repeated questioning he admitted that the unions could be disadvantaged depending on the decision of the court on the question of deregistration of some of the unions which was before it at that time. </para><para>So the Government was in a very awkward situation as far as the amalgamation of these unions was concerned. It is clear that the Government, under pressure from the Democratic Labor Party, was trying to make amalgamation more difficult. The Minister, somewhat reluctantly, was dancing to the tune of the DLP. My accusation can be proved. Honourable members will recall his statement of intent of December 1971. At paragraph 95 of that statement of intent he said: </para><quote>
          <para>We will amend the Act to prevent unions from enforcing compulsory unionism. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">This did not stop the Democratic Labor Party, because most of its support in the industrial movement comes from the Federated Clerks Union, which would be a difficult union to organise without compulsory unionsim. I am not casting any reflection on that union. It has every right to try to keep compulsory unionism and we are pleased that it has been successful. From then on the Minister forgot all about the matter and let it drop. So his intention to abolish compulsory unionsim disappeared entirely. </para><para>However, something that was not mentioned in his statement of intent was included in this Bill. That was a proviso to make amalgamation of the unions more difficult. His speech at the Central Industrial Secretariat dinner on 2nd March showed his earlier attitude towards amalgamation. This was a dinner connected with the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat for the purpose of amalgamating 2 employer bodies - the Employers Federation and the Chamber of Manufactures - to co-ordinate their industrial relations policies. At that dinner the Minister said: </para><quote>
          <para>Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous Governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely, to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the rights of members or groups of members. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">He also ridiculed the idea that 50 per cent plus of the total membership should vote. He pointed out to this body that the reasons which prompted them to form their body were no doubt those that motivated the metal trades unions to amalgamate. He pointed out the advantages of amalgamation. In fact, his whole speech showed that he supported the amalgamation of smaller unions into bigger unions. Then at the behest of the DLP he brought in these amendments designed to make amalgamation much harder. However, the progress of the metal trades unions was too great and despite the efforts of the DLP their amalgamation has become an accomplished fact. </para><para>However, the backdating of the commencement of this proposed new section to 26th May means that other unions which have made considerable progress towards amalgamation will have to start all over again. I do not know the names of all the unions which are in the process of arranging amalgamation, but there are several. They include the Ironworkers and Chemical Workers Union and the Theatre Managers Association is another. Also, the Bacon Employees Union in Queensland is seeking amalgamation with the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union; I know that negotiations in this case have been going on for about 2 years. The amalgamation of the metal trades unions as the Minister well knows took about 3 years to complete. There are several other unions which under this legislation will have to start their negotiations all over again. </para><para>I would like to quote from an article entitled: &#39;Union Law Backdated&#39;. It reads: </para><quote>
          <para class="block">The  Ironworers&#39;  national secretary <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short)</inline> yesterday condemned the retrospectivity issue and sent a telegram asking the Federal Government to defer the proposed legislation. </para>
          <para>Late tonight the Senate was still debating additional clauses of the Bill. . . . </para>
        </quote><para class="block">This shows that the union was opposed to this measure because it interfered with the steps it had already taken. If the Bill had been returned in the form in which it left this chamber - that is, to come into effect on a date to be proclaimed - unions would have been able to commence and complete the amalgamation proceedings. If the proclamation had been held up for a period they would not have been disadvantaged. </para><para>These amendments seem to be aimed at the amalgamation of the ironworkers, chemical workers and the others I have mentioned. Why should this control be restricted to the unions? If this is to be the new way of life why does it not apply to employer bodies and companies which amalgamate? The Government should be making amalgamation easier instead of more difficult. The Minister, if he were free to do so, would admit this. For example, amalgamation could prevent all of the demarcation disputes that occur. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan</inline> of the Metal Trades Employers Federation saw the wisdom of this. He supported the unions being free to amalgamate. Instead this Government is placing obstacles in the way of amalgamation. How different it is when commercial interests are concerned. It has taken the Government over 10 years to do something about the Trade Practices Act which is not yet law. The Bill has not even been introduced despite many promises. But when it comes to interfering with the unions legislation becomes a matter of extreme emergency. This Government will go down in history as being biased towards trade unions and not interested in industrial relations except to stir up strife for political purposes. </para><para>So much for that part of the legislation. There is just one other point to which I would like to refer. We oppose the amendment to clause 51 to which the Minister has referred. I refer here to amendment No. 7 in the schedule of amendments made by the Senate. I do not want to go into the details of it. What we wanted in our amendment, which I do not have time to quote, was that in circumstances when a union which had membership of less than 5 per cent of the membership of the host union was being absorbed, the host union would not be required to have a ballot. </para><para class="block">This was a reasonable provision particularly if we look at paragraph (a) of our amendment which states: </para><list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. which special circumstances the Industrial Registrar could refuse the exemption. </para>
          </item>
        </list><para class="block">The Government&#39;s amendment now before the House was obviously moved by the DLP with the connivance of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> who no doubt assisted with its drafting. It is indefinite and leaves ground for a lot of litigation. Our amendment was a definite proposition, was reasonably clear and in fact left it to the Industrial Registrar, to decide whether he did not want to grant the amalgamation, even though the question that was at issue was only whether the union seeking amalgamation had a membership equal to only 5 per cent of the host union&#39;s, the host union did not have to take a ballot. I think that was a reasonable amendment. I regret that the Government did not see its way clear to do something about it. The Opposition intends to vote against this amendment as well as the other one which I have mentioned. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb).</inline> I join him in opposing as strongly as I possibly can amendments Nos 1 and 7 sent back to us from the Senate. To refresh the mind of honourable members I point out that amendment No. 1  -  and it is not explained why this is the case - seeks to vary the date of operation of the Bill. I refer to clause 2 (2.) to which this amendment applies. This clause deals with proposed new sections 41, 49, 51, 53 and 68. The Bill states that the legislation will come into operation on the day on which this Bill receives Royal Assent. In fact, the amendment which was moved and carried in the Senate makes the date of operation, as I understand it, Friday of last week. Surely this action poses the question why it was necessary to back-date the legislation and why the original provisions of the Bill were not agreed to. The Government must have thought when the Bill was drafted that it would come into operation from the date of Royal Assent. In the short time in which I have been in this House this seems to have been in line with the common terminology of Bills. Yet, in this legislation an amendment has been moved by the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Government In the Senate and agreed to after opposition from the Australian Labor Party in that place. This amendment would make the date of operation a day before the Bill even received Royal Assent or the concurrence of members of this Parliament. </para>
        <para>When one reads the clauses that axe to be affected by the date being set back I think the position starts to become a bit clearer. Clause 51, which is the clause on which I placed some emphasis before, is one of the clauses which will be affected by the back-dating of this Bill. We should bear in mind the fact that only on Tuesday of this week, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sharp,</inline> the Industrial Registrar, finally came to execute all of the instruments necessary for the amalgamation of the metal trades unions. There were still some arguments going on in the metal trades unions, particularly in regard to the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, on Friday of last week in regard to several pipelines which are to be laid in Port Phillip Bay. Does the Government or the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> intend that this new provision in the Bill should now be used to upset that amalgamation that has taken something in excess of 12 months - very nearly 2 years - to go through the procedures? Is the Government with one stroke of its pen going to place all of these negotiations and agreements and everything that has been done in jeopardy and require the union to go right back to square one and start again? I well remember the honourable member for Stirling, when this Bill was last in this place, asking the Minister at a very early hour in the morning whether this Bill in any way would affect the amalgamation of the 3 metal trades unions. The Minister could not answer because his adviser was not present. Only when finally pressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> did the Minister say that there was no guarantee that the effects of this Bill would not be made applicable to these unions that had come within one inch, after having run a distance of many miles, of consummating their amalgamation. </para>
        <para>It is very obvious that the amendments are aimed at the amalgamation or nonamalgamations of unions and nothing else. </para>
        <para class="block">Amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 7 are the critical amendments that deal with amalgamation. I think that members of my own Party in this place canvassed the question of amalgamtion very well when the Bill was originally in this chamber. We made it quite clear that in our view this Bill ought to be retitled as a Bill for an Act to prevent amalgamations. Just before he resumed his seat, the honourable member for Stirling mentioned that the Minister for Labour and National Service had spoken about the need for amalgamation and, in fact, had lauded employer organisations which, for a variety of reasons, had chosen to amalgamate. The Minister has made it clear publicly that he believes there are too many unions and that there should be an amalgamation of unions, yet he has been instrumental in introducing this type of legislation which makes the amalgamation of unions virtually impossible. </para>
        <para>I wonder whether this Government, which is placing all these impediments upon the amalgamation of trade unions, which it seems to regard as different from every other organisation in the country, would be prepared to introduce into this House as an amendment to the Companies Act, the Trade Practices Act or any other Act, guidelines, rules and regulations to resolve the amalgamation of organisations such as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, in respect of which we recently experienced a fiasco. Is there any need for organisations of this ilk to be bound by the very restrictive processes that will be established by this Bill in respect of organisations of working class people who come together to further their aims? Perhaps in the Government&#39;s view - once again, my friend the honourable member for Stirling mentioned this - trade unions&#39; standing in the community is different from that of other organisations. Is this Government really an anti-union government? Does it oppose the amalgamation and establishment of organisations that are formed primarily to support the interests of that section of the community which is not in the best position to protect itself? Or does this Government come down on the side of the very wealthy and powerful organisations and leave them to their own devices when it comes to a question of amalgamation? </para>
        <para>It is well known that the provisions contained in the amendment were asked for by the Federal Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Short, who, of course, was ably assisted by the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, whose general <inline font-weight="bold">president Mr Maynes</inline> was seen skulking around the corridors of Parliament House only last week. He was conferring with his mouthpieces in the Senate. The amendment which has been produced is a direct result of the pressure which was applied by a minority political party in this Parliament, supported by a minority group in the community. As I see it, this leads to a cynical arithmetical exercise by any union which wishes to amalgamate with another union. The amendment provides that if the membership of the host union is not increased by more than 5 per cent in an amalgamation, the union can make an application to be exempted from a ballot. This amendment does not set out conditions that would preclude an unscrupulous act by somebody or any act which would be legitimate within the wide application of the amendment. A large union could say to a smaller organisation: &#39;We will dispense with enough of your membership to leave you with only the required 5 per cent and then we will not need a ballot&#39;. Dangers of that sort are inherent in this situation. </para>
        <para>This amendment initially, is bad. We said that it was bad when it was proposed in this place and it has not been improved by the Democratic Labor Party, whose masters in the community insisted that certain amendments be carried. The provision has been worsened and, like my colleagues in the Labor Party, I intend to vote against it. Divisions will be called on these matters and we will vote solidly against them. We trust that enough wisdom will prevail on the Government side of the House for Government supporters to listen to the reason of the arguments that have been put forward and that they will join with us and have this iniquitous legislation thrown out. </para>

          <para>- It seems to me that amendment No. 7 which has been proposed by the Government is completely hypocritical. My disquiet is not in any way alleviated by the fact that, when this amendment was moved by the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate, no explanation was given by the Minister in charge of the Bill in that chamber. I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> will give some explanation now as to why the amendment originally moved by the DLP in the Senate was so worded. 1 invite the House to examine the amendment that was proposed in the Senate by the Australian Labor Party. This amendment provided that paragraph (b) should read: the total number of members of the de-registering organisation or organisations is not more than five per centum of the number of members of the first-mentioned organisation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">The amendment moved in the Senate by the DLP and supported by the Government purports to assist the amalgamation of unions or the absorption of little unions by big unions. I strongly suspect that the amendment moved in the Senate by the DLP, wilh the connivance of the Government, was brought about with the connivance also of the draftsmen of the Department or, perhaps, the Parliamentary Draftsman. The draftsmen certainly appear to have helped the Government to overcome certain problems in this regard. The Government&#39;s amendment states that (b) should now read: the total number of members that have been or could be admitted to the organisation upon and by any reason of the amalgamation. . . . </para>
        <para class="block">It appears to me that the insertion of the words &#39;and could be&#39; is quite critical. The Government would like to have us believe that the amendment will enable small unions, after a plebiscite, to be absorbed into bigger unions. A plebiscite would not need to be conducted in the larger union. However, the phrase &#39;and could be&#39; which was introduced by the DLP with the connivance of the Government in actual fact will frustrate the supposed purpose of the amendment. No explanation was given by the Government in the Senate and I think that the House is entitled to some explanation now. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I support completely the remarks of previous speakers from this side of the House. This is a very sorry attempt on the part of the DLP to try to block union amalgamations all along the line. The DLP is completely opposed to such amalgamations because it knows that union amalgamation is in the interests of industrial peace and of the advancement generally of the cause of trade unionists and workers. This is a sorry tale of betrayal of the working people by the DLP and, from speeches which he has made in the past supporting the cause of amalgamation, I think that the Minister for Labour and National Service knows this very well. I am saddened to see that once again the Government has connived with the DLP to defeat yet another amalgamation. I hope that the Minister will give some explanation to the House as to why the Government has taken this action on this occasion. </para>

          <para>-  The basic philosophy behind the amendments that have been moved is a simple one. The Government believes it is important that new Part VIIIA of the Act which deals with amalgamations of organisations should begin to operate as soon as possible. Honourable members opposite appear to believe that the amendments now being considered are aimed at inhibiting or preventing union amalgamation. I would like to make it quite clear to the Committee that these provisions are designed specifically to ensure that the control of organisations remains with the rank and file members of those organisations. Part VIIIA constitutes a new code as to what is required of organisations seeking to amalgamate and it is clear and specific in its detail. For the first time, it presents to organisations a set of provisions dealing specifically with amalgamation and, therefore, the Government believes that it should operate as soon as possible. The old provisions should not be continued, save for a limited time during an interim period. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I would like to make clear to the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> that the amendment is not designed to interfere with the projected amalgamation of the various metal trade unions. If the honourable member reads clause 68 of the Bill carefully, he will find that that is made abundantly clear. That clause provides that the new Part dealing with the amalgamation of organisations is not to apply in relation to an amalgam as to which, before the commencement of clause 68, certain applications had been made to the registrar and a valid request for deregistration had been lodged with him under the principal Act. As to the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the applications for deregistration by the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society and by the Sheet Metal Workers Union, the Registrar signed the instruments of deregistration on 30th May, and deregistration will operate 3 months from then, that is on 30th August 1972. The objections to the deregistration were withdrawn when the Registrar had the matter before him on 29th May. </para>
        <para>Turning now to amendment No. 7, to which I think the honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Gun)</inline> specifically referred, this amendment is an amalgam of the amendments brought into the Senate not only by the Australian Democratic Labor Party but also by the Opposition and accepted by the Government. It proposes that a new subsection be added to section 158k which forms part of the new Part VIIIa which deals with amalgamations. The purpose of this amendment is to allow some flexibility as to the holding of ballots in connection with amalgamations, where a small body is to amalgamate with a large one. Part of the amalgamation processes provided for by the Bill requires all organisations involved in the proposed amalgamation to hold a ballot of their members, but the amendment recognises that it would be unsatisfactory, for example, if where a relatively small organisation was proposing to amalgamate with a large one, the latter should be required to have a ballot of its members. </para>
        <para>Therefore, the amendment provides that where an organisation proposes to deregister and, by amalgamation agreement, have its members absorbed into an existing organisation, which would be the host body in an amalgamation, there need not be a ballot of the members in the host organisation if the total number of members in the deregistering organisation or organisations complies with the formula set out in the amendment. Under the amendment the host body would be required to seek from the Registrar an exemption from the ballot provisions, and the Registrar would be given a discretion not to grant an exemption if he considered there were special circumstances which could cause him not to grant it. There would, however, be certain limita tions, as set out in the amendment, on the circumstances in which an exemption could be granted. That is a brief explanation of why the Government has proposed these 2 amendments. </para>

        <para class="block">The reason for this motion, of course, is obvious. It is obvious from their mirth that members of the Liberal Party in no circumstances wish to come back early to the Parliament to discuss wool. The other objective is to see the response of the Country Party, which has been so vocal in wanting urgent legislation on wool. Members of the Country Party have been making a great song and dance inside and outside this Parliament about the need to legislate and the need to make decisions in respect of wool marketing. In particular, the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Maisey),</inline> the honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Pettitt)</inline> and the honourable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hallett),</inline> to mention 3, have expressed grave concern about the Government&#39;s non-decision with respect to wool marketing. Other honourable members have expressed similar views. Speaking on behalf of members of the Labor Party, I can say we agree with them. We have made that quite clear. But the principal objectives of asking that the Parliament be recalled before 30th June 1972 are, firstly, to consider the Randall wool report, which the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> today informed the House has been received by the Government, and, secondly, to enable effective action to be taken to rectify the current uncertainty on wool marketing. I move this amendment because, as honourable members well know, on 7th October last year the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Bill was introduced into the Parliament by the Minister for Primary Industry. The long title of that Bill read: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>An Act to provide for Payments on behalf of the Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring a Minimum Standard of Financial Returns to Producers of certain Australian Wool sold or otherwise dealt with on or after the second day of July, One thousand nine hundred and  seventy-one,  and before the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words that Act officially concludes on 30th June next, and wool deficiency payments will not be made after that date. There has been no indication from this Government on whether wool deficiency payments will continue to be made after 30th June or whether amendments will be made to the Act before that time. This Act authorises the appropriation of money to make wool deficiency payments to ensure an average return at a certain level as specified in the Act within the prescribed period. The prescribed period is clearly defined in the Act as the period ending on 30th June 1972. Can any member of the Country Party or the Liberal Party tell me what will happen after 30th June 1972? What do they say to that question which every wool grower they meet asks them? The honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Pettitt)</inline> and the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> are trying to interrupt my speech with interjections. The honourable member for Hume will get his chance to vote and we will see how good he is. We all know how he will vote, just as he talks outside this Parliament. We know how the Minister for Shipping and Transport will vote. He will vote in the same way as he always does. The point I make is that the provisions of the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act 1971 cease to operate after 30th June this year. This House will shortly commence the winter recess. No amendment has been made to this Act, no amendment has been foreshadowed and no decision has been taken in regard to any new legislation to enable these payments to continue to be made after 30th June. The 30th June is an important date because the new wool selling season commences on 1st July. It is important that the whole scheme of wool marketing be clarified. Before this Parliament rises we should at least be in a position to know what will happen after 30th June. We have heard in recent weeks, both inside and outside this Parliament, a number of statements made by members of the Country Party about the need for an acquisition scheme, the need for a drastic reform with respect to wool marketing and the need to treat these things as a matter of urgency. We will test those honourable members in this House on their statements just as the Opposition tested 3 key Liberals on the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill. We all know what they did. We will see the same thing happen in regard to this matter. Members of the Liberal Party and of the Country Party make big brave statements outside this Parliament but it is a different thing when it comes to saying them in this Parliament and showing how fair dinkum they are and whether they are prepared to back up their statements. </para>
        <para>After the Government has had a week or so to consider the Randall report the Parliament will debate it and the conclusions in it, and the Government will introduce an amendment to this Act to enable deficiency payments to be made for a further prescribed period or introduce new legislation with respect to a wool acquisition scheme or the marketing of wool. The Parliament knows full well that this Government is incapable of giving competent leadership. A prime example of this is the Government&#39;s stalling in this place month after month with the excuse that it is waiting for the Randall report. The Randall report has now reached the Government. We do not say that next week a decision should be taken on that report, but what we do say is that because this Act expires on 30th June 1972 a positive decision has to be taken. If the decision involves money - obviously it must - some explanation should be given to the Parliament on whether an amendment will be made to the Act or new legislation will be introduced. What will the Government do? Will it introduce some airy-fairy scheme which it will announce in the Budget Speech? </para>
        <para>The provisions of this Act will not apply from 1st July 1972. Until this Parliament resumes in August where will the wool growers stand? Every wool grower in Australia is asking the same question: &#39;What will the Government do?&#39;. The honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Maisey)</inline> has asked time and again: &#39;What will the Government do?&#39; In the television series &#39;This Day Tonight&#39; the honourable member referred to the Randall report as a subterfuge. </para>

            <para>- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> The reasons why we on this side of the House believe that the Parliament should resume before 30th June are obvious. The whole wool industry wants to know what the Government intends to do. What action will the Government take? This action can be voiced only by an Act of Parliament such as the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act. As I have said, the Randall report is now before the Government. We can only assume that this is the final report because we thought it had been finalised some weeks ago. We have had no statement from the Government on how long the Government is to consider the report. All that is needed is some indication that a statement will be made prior to the next wool selling season which commences on 1st July. This is not good enough. This is the Parliament of the Commonwealth in which members represent electorates throughout Australia, including wool growing electorates. It is completely unsatisfactory for this Parliament to rise today without an effective decision being taken by this Government in regard to the important matter of wool marketing especially when we know that by an Act of Parliament the wool deficiency payments scheme will conclude on 30th June. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>For that reason it is of paramount importance that this Parliament be recalled at some time prior to 30th June to consider this most important question and if necessary, if the Government holds this opinion, to consider introducing legislation to do one of 2 things, either to completely nullify the wool deficiency payments scheme or to extend the period for payments. The Government could also consider introducing new legislation with respect to wool marketing in Australia. It is for those reasons that I have moved the amendment which seeks to have the House recalled at some date to be fixed prior to 30th June. </para>

          <para>- I second the amendment. This afternoon the Opposition has made an attempt to discuss the Commonwealth Electoral. Act and the 75 other items on the notice paper before the House goes into recess, but no matter requires debate or finalisation before this House goes into recess more than does the marketing of the wool clip. However, as the Government has decided that the House will go into recess today, it is important that the House should reassemble before 30th June, for the reasons given this afternoon by the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson).</inline> I remind members that in his report for 1971 the  Chairman  of the Australian Wool Board made a most important statement. I use it to illustrate the importance of the wool industry to Australia as well as the seriousness of the situation that is confronting the industry. In that report he said: </para>

          <para>As income has fallen, farm debts have arisen alarmingly. Many of the industry&#39;s biggest debtors are its otherwise efficient producers. </para>

        <para class="block">That is known to be true by any member representing a rural electorate. While the honourable member for Dawson was addressing the House, Government members were interjecting: &#39;Where are the wool growers?&#39; In reply one might well ask them: &#39;How will the wool growers vote on this particular issue? How concerned are they about their fellows on the farms and about the situation in the rural industries because of the inactivity of this Government over a long period?&#39; It is all very well for Government members to say that the situation has improved. It has, but in spite of the Government not because of action taken by it. The Government now has an opportunity to show the level of its concern for electors in rural industries. It is of immense importance that this Parliament should reassemble to debate the Randall report, and that this report be tabled in this Parliament for distribution. As the member for Dawson said, we need to come back here to learn what the Government will do about the support scheme during the coming 12 months. </para>
        <para>Thousands of wool growers and their families and rural communities throughout Australia are in desperate need, but their needs can be met only as a result of Government decision and action. In the present circumstances it should be decision and action taken after regard has been had to the Randall report. Surely such decision and action ought to have been taken long ago. As I said in a speech I made in this House last week, in 1964 responsible individuals were advocating that total acquisition of the wool clip would be the answer to the industry&#39;s problems and that effect should be given to certain recommendations of the Australian Wool Industry Council. The present position has not come upon the Government unexpectedly. As I said in my earlier speech, it should have been prepared for it. It should have prepared legislation for submission to this Parliament before it went into recess, but now that the Government has decided that the House shall go into recess, surely it should ensure that the House will reassemble in order to debate the business that we have been advocating this afternoon. One Government member, who is a member of the political Party to which the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> belongs - the Minister responsible for this matter - said last week that the Government had resorted to a subterfuge in this regard. </para>

            <para>- Very well, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. Here</inline> is an opportunity for the honourable member for Moore to avoid resorting to subterfuge. By voting for the amendment he has an opportunity to stand on the side of the people whom he represents in this place. Indeed, so can the honourable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hallett).</inline> As both those honourable members well know, grave concern is felt throughout the rural electorates of this country, no less in Western Australia than in any other State of the Commonwealth. Because of the lack of security felt in the industry because people do not know what the Government intends to do at the end of this month or the end of next month in relation to the support scheme or in relation to wool marketing, it is essential that they should know what is to be done. All we get from the Government are statements. We do not want statements. What we want is legislation passed through this House. But first we want a debate on the Randall report before any decision is made and any legislation is passed through here. So I support wholeheartedly the amendment that has been so ably moved this afternoon by the honourable member for Dawson. I commend it to the House and I commend in particular that the House reassemble before 30th June in order to debate the Randall report and the state of the wool industry, and in order that appropriate legislation be passed through this House. </para>

            <para>- We have before the House a motion that relates to the time when we would normally resume. I see no reason why the House should countenance the amendment which the Opposition has moved. The reason for the amendment relates to the 2 matters which have been initially raised in this place by the honourable member for Dawson and his seconder. They have suggested reasons why there should again be a meeting of Parliament before the scheduled resumption date. If legislation relating to the matters raised is to come into force of course it must come before the Parliament, and at that time there will be adequate opportunity for the Parliament to debate the substance of that legislation. In the meantime the position is that we have had over the course of the last few months adequate opportunities to discuss a report which was submitted by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. As I understand the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson, it suggests that a further opportunity should be given to this Parliament to discuss the Government&#39;s attitude to that report. I suggest that there is no reason for this House to meet at a time when it normally would not meet to discuss our attitude to the AWIC report. I believe at the same time that it is essential- </para>

Normally I would have given him notice that I was to move this amendment, but he took me by surprise this afternoon. The blue paper setting out the programme for today listed a matter of public importance. It was only by mere luck that I happened to be here when other business was given precedence over this matter. I can understand the Minister&#39;s problem, but it is not the AWIC report with which we are concerned; it is the Randall report and the fact that the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act concludes on 30th lune. They are the only 2 reasons for my amendment. On 30th June the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act concludes. What are we going to tell the wool growers after that date? </para>

            <para>- The reason I mentioned the AWIC report - I appreciate the explanation given by the honourable member for Dawson - is that the Randall report is a document relating to the AWIC report, and presumably the purpose of the amendment is to enable us to discuss the attitude taken by the Government to the AWIC report. In essence what we are looking at is a matter of principle, the question of wool marketing, plus the second issue which the honourable gentleman raised, the question of wool deficiency payments. Both these matters will necessarily have to come before the Parliament in the next session. Both are matters of consequence to the industry. As a result of questions from both sides of the House I have explained that a statement will be made by the Government on the attitude that it takes towards the AWIC report as soon as possible. It has been dependent upon the receipt of a report from the Randall Committee, which has just been received. It is the third report from the Committee. There have been 2 earlier reports relating to other aspects of wool marketing. The Government will be taking a decision, and it will be taking it in time to allow the industry to be advised of what the policy of the Government will be for the season that will commence on 1st July next. </para>

        <para>I do not believe that a case can be substantiated for this Parliament to resume to debate these matters prior to the commencement of the new wool selling season. I believe there have been opportunities for matters relating to the AWIC report to be raised in this Parliament and for subsequent debate to take place. I believe that the fact that this report was distributed in this Parliament, or was distributed through the agency of the ad hoc committee, the Vasey Committee of the AWIC, which is of course the body that prepared the report, enabled every member of this Parliament to debate the issues. For that reason I do not believe that it is a matter which has been debarred from debate prior to this time. Of course it is important that members of a Parliament have an opportunity to debate significant policy matters. Of course it is significant for them to be able to consider matters of principle, but it is important that they take opportunities to do so while the Parliament is normally and customarily in session. </para>
        <para>I do not believe that in circumstances in which the Opposition has not taken advantage of opportunities previously available to it the Opposition should disrupt the customary proceedings in the course of a recess, which is designed to enable the preparation of the Budget and the planning of a wide ranging series of programmes which are normally undertaken by the Government before the commencement of the Budget session in August. I do not believe that an adequate case has been established for accepting the amendment which the honourable member for Dawson has moved. I believe that members from both sides of this House have had adequate opportunity to raise the matters which the honourable member for Dawson has suggested should again be canvassed. The second matter which he suggests we need an opportunity to debate, the question of the wool deficiency payments, is also a matter which I believe either could have been debated prior to this or can be debated during the Budget session. It is a fact that this was the procedure that was followed with respect to the 36c price support scheme which was introduced by the Government for the present wool selling season. As to the statement by the honourable member for Forrest that this Government only makes statements, I think the fact that the wool market has recovered, the fact that the Australian Wool Commission has been constituted and the fact that there is a wool price deficiency payments scheme all speak for themselves. For that reason the Government does not accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson that the House should meet prior to 30th June 1972. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition has brought forward this matter of public importance because the Government has been sitting on the Tariff Board report for almost 12 months. It has made various promises of bringing the report before the House but until today we have been unsuccessful in obtaining this information. I am pleased to say that as a result of the discussion of this matter of public importance we will finally flush the fox out of his lair. I believe that the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> when he follows me, will make reference to the Tariff Board report. So at least the. decision of the Opposition to bring forward this matter of public importance will pay dividends, will produce a result and will force the Government into making a decision. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>About 5 years ago the Government announced a policy of introducing Australian shipping into the overseas conference lines. This decision was supported strongly by the Opposition. Some 4 years after this decision was made the Government has found itself in the position where we have only 4 ships trading in the overseas tonnage - namely, the &#39;Australian Endeavour&#39;, the &#39;Australian Enterprise&#39;, the Munga&#39; and the &#39;Matthew Flinders&#39;, and some time in the next 12 months no doubt there will be the &#39;Australian Exporter&#39;. I think this is a disgraceful situation. We have some 5,000 sailings a year from Australian ports handling exports to the value of $4,400m and representing something like 100 million to 110 million tons of cargo. So there is any amount of trade for an Australian merchant fleet to carry. The Government should be getting on with the job. </para>
          <para>Even though the then Minister for Trade and Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen, stated that the object of the exercise was to get a window into the conferences, up to this point if there is a window into the conferences the Government has not told the Parliament what it is. Members of the Opposition have tried to obtain information as to what is actually transpiring in this trade and what the window is disclosing. The report of the Australian National Line discloses no confidential information or no information of value to honourable members. All we know is that it would appear that the venture into the European conference in particular has been a failure, that the recommendations that were made originally for roll-on roll-off ships to be used have been borne out and that the decision of the Government to go into cellular container ships has not been the success that it was hoped it would be. </para>
          <para>As far as the coastal trade is concerned, at present I believe 17 Australian ships are laid up with a displacement of 600 men who normally would man those ships. When another 300 complete their leave there will be a total of 900 Australian seamen unemployed because of the policy of this Government. We on this side of the House believe that something positive should be done about it. We believe that the Government should have taken action to move into the crude oil trade. In 1970-71 there were 3,001 million gallons of crude oil imported into Australia. All of this was brought to this country in foreign owned and manned ships. At the present time all ships in the New Guinea to Australia trade are foreign owned and manned. In the period including all of 1971 and up to February 1972- that is, a period of 14 months - 27 ships carried phosphate from Nauru to Australia; 25 ships carried phosphate from Christmas Island to Australia; and 12 carried phosphate from Ocean Island to Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I have already shown to the Minister for Shipping and Transport which very clearly gives the picture of the amount of phosphate that is carried from these islands to Australia. </para>

              <para>-  I thank the House. At the present time, as this table discloses, there are 13 dredges tied up throughout Australia. Approximately 500 men, who would normally have been working full time on these dredges, have been laid off. Dredging contracts in Australia have been let to foreign owned dredging companies. This is being done while we have unemployed Australians and ships, some of which were built in Australia, that are tied up on the coast. I take one case in particular, namely that of Bunbury. Some 2 years ago an acrimonious debate took place in Western Australia where the trade union movement was trying to get work in Bunbury harbour carried out by Australian dredges manned by Australian crews. But the then Liberal Government of Western Australia insisted on acceptance of the lowest tender which went to a South Korean dredging company. A South </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Korean ship manned by a South Korean crew was sent here to do the work. Today that company is well behind in its time schedule. It has run into problems that Australian dredging companies knew existed. The Australian companies knew about a hard rock shelf which would present great problems. The South Korean company did not have the equipment to do the job at the time the contract was let and it still is in the same position. The result is that work that should have been reaching completion has been held up. It is well behind schedule. These are some of the things that have developed because of the Government&#39;s allowing foreign dredging companies to come onto the Australian coast to do work which should be done by Australian dredges manned by Australian seamen. </para>
          <para>Another matter I want to deal with relates to shipbuilding. Whilst the Government has made orders available, one of the tragedies of &#39;the Australian shipbuilding industry is that at present the yards do not have a clear plan of continuity of employment. Once a tender for a ship has been submitted and accepted it takes about 6 to 9 months to organise the work and materials and get everything flowing. Unfortunately this Government has a stop-go programme of shipbuilding. This statement was made only recently in regard to the activities of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd in Brisbane: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The immediate survival chances of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd shipbuilding activities at Brisbane appear to depend on one of 2 tenders it has submitted to the Australian Shipbuilding Board coming to  fruitation  within the next few weeks. </para>
            <para>On a sober market assessment of this happening, the chances appear to be very, slim. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Here is a large industry - the second largest industry in Queensland - which is in a position where employment for approximately 3,000 men could be lost to that State. It is time the Government did something about shipbuilding. A Tariff Board inquiry commenced in 1969. The report of the Board was presented to the Minister on 12th June 1971. It has taken almost 12 months for the Government to make up its mind on the policy that has been recommended by the Tariff Board. If it had not been for the raising of the matter of public importance this afternoon I doubt very much whether the Government would even at this point of time table the Tariff Board report. In any case, we on this side of the House look forward with interest to what the report will contain. I would like to take the opportunity of commenting on it later. At least we are going to get the report tabled this afternoon- or I hope the Minister will deal with it in a few moments. </para>
          <para>At present there are 38 foreign built ships operating interstate and 14 operating intrastate on the Australian coast. This makes a total of 52 ships. Also there are 3 oil drilling ships and one drilling platform, all of which were built overseas. The replacement of these ships by Australian built ships would make an excellent ship building programme for Australian yards. At least if such a policy were adopted the shipbuilding yards could plan their work and get on with the job of providing employment for Australian workers. I seek leave of the Minister to incorporate in Hansard another list of ships which shows all of the ships built overseas and operating on the coast. </para>

          <para class="block">I thank the Minister and honourable members. Whilst the shipyards throughout Australia at the moment have current orders and work is under way, there is not sufficient work in the programme that is already under tender to keep any one of the 3 major shipyards operating in Australia fully occupied for 12 months. The tenders that are still open - even throwing in the extra 3 ships for which tenders have been called - when added to those yet to be allocated would not provide employment for one of the 3 major yards in Australia. Any number of ships built overseas are operating on the Australian coast. Replacements for these ships should be built in Australian yards. This Government should take action to do something about the situation. </para>
          <para>The other matter to which I wish to refer deals with docks. Once again the Government has taken too long to make a decision in this case. It has received the report from the Cabinet sub-committee which is tied up with the Tariff Board&#39;s report into shipbuilding. This report should have been tabled long ago. Very strong demands have been made on the Government by the Australian Chamber of Shipping. The Government was taken to task at a transport conference held in Canberra in March 1971 when speakers from various shipping interests strongly condemned the Australian Government&#39;s failure to do something about docks, and to provide adequate docks throughout Australia so that work could be carried out by Australian companies and not be given to overseas companies. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard a question I asked about this matter. </para>

              <para>- I thank the House and the Minister. We on this side of the House are strongly in favour of ships operating on the Australian coast being repaired by Australian workmen in Australian shipyards and in Australian docks wherever possible. I wrote to the Minister only this week to draw to his attention the fact that a little old ship, the liquid gas carrier &#39;Arago&#39;, was to go to Hong Kong for a 4-year survey although this work could be carried out in Australia. This survey will entail a good deal of work. When I heard about this I got in touch with some of the shipyards that would be interested in this work. The State dockyard in Newcastle has a slip which is available, which will be made available and on which the work can be done immediately for the company which owns the ship. The position is that these overseas companies bring to Australia ships manned with overseas crews and, as soon as a quid can be made for the Australian workman and the Australian economy from the repair of these ships, the companies want to take them overseas to Hong Kong, Singapore or somewhere else. We on this side of the House are totally opposed to this policy of allowing foreign-built ships to operate on our coast when the ships which are needed could be built in Australian shipyards. The same remark applies to ship repair work. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In conclusion I summarise the attitude of the Labor Party on the 4 questions relating to shipping that have been raised in this discussion of a matter of public importance. We believe that a reasonable amount of Australian trade should be carded in Australian ships, built and manned by Australians. I accept that countries which buy commodities such as coal, ore and other minerals from Australia have the right to transport these materials in their own ships but, in turn, we are entitled to transport in Australian ships our imports of crude oil, phosphates and other goods of that type which require a one-voyage journey. We believe that all dredging in Australia should be carried out by Australian dredges manned with Australian crews so that, at least, the work can be done to Australian standards of employment. We believe that it is time that there was a long-term, planned, shipbuilding programme to replace all foreign-built ships operating on our coast with ships which have been built in Australia. I have already provided the House with details relating to this aspect We believe that sufficient docks should be built, not financed completely by the Commonwealth but at least with reasonable Commonwealth assistance, to provide on our coast facilities to carry out the repair of ships that are operating around our coast and any other ships that could need assistance. If this were done, all this work would be carried out by Australian workmen in Australian shipyards. </para>

            <para>-  I am a little inclined to wonder why the Opposition has proposed this matter of public importance for discussion at this time. Let me relate to the House the wording of this matter of public importance. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government&#39;s failure to plan the orderly development and expansion of the Australian shipping, dredging, shipbuilding and docking industries. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Each of those subjects is fairly wide-ranging. In all fairness to the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> whilst I recognise that he has a keen interest in shipping, I must say to him that he has made no attempt to make a fair presentation of the facts in relation to Government policy towards shipping. I believe that, contrary to what the honourable member has said, the Government has policies which have led to the orderly development and expansion of the very things that he mentioned. </para>
          <para>I believe that I can easily prove my assertion by reading an account of each of the matters that I have before me. Regrettably, time will preclude me from establishing my case fully. Let me deal firstly with the report of the Tariff Board. The honourable member for Newcastle expressed a belief that he had flushed me out in regard to the Tariff Board report. The facts are that when I first heard that this matter of public importance was to be raised today, I rang the honourable member for Newcastle and said to him: &#39;I have been working on a statement relating to the Tariff Board report because the Government has come to decisions and I was hoping to have the statement finally prepared so that I could give it to you, in accordance with the normal courtesies of the House, 2 hours before I hoped to make the statement in the House. But if you proceed with this matter of public importance, I will be unable to complete the preparation of the statement on the Tariff Board report and to make the statement to the Parliament.&#34; That is exactly what has eventuated. I am now forced by the actions of the honourable member for Newcastle in raising this matter of public importance to make a statement on the Tariff Board report, on which Government decisions have been made, outside this Parliament, after the Parliament rises, because 1 have not had time to complete the statement. This is quite contrary to the Government&#39;s wishes in regard to the statement. We were working at full steam to present it to the House and make the statement properly. </para>

              <para>- The wool grower knows full well the value of Labor Party policies on rural industries. Do not start me on that. The honourable member for Dawson appeared on television one night recently and I happened to see the programme. I thought it was a delightful programme. It was a great credit to the producers of This Day Tonight&#39; that the programme should show him thundering forth in such fine fashion and denouncing the Labor Party&#39;s approach to rural industries, knowing full well that any chance he had of capturing a few votes in the rural areas had been destroyed by the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party. The rural electorates are fully aware of the cheap stunts that members of the Labor Party get up to in this House. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Newcastle referred to the number of imported ships that are in this country and made a case to suggest that they were displacing Australianbuilt ships in the coastal trade. The Government has been impeccable, when allowing a foreign-built ship into this country for a special task or for  a  short time or for any purpose, in studying carefully whether an Australian ship should be built to take its place. We have had complete co-operation from the shipping industry and there has been a complete understanding by the shipbuilding industry of our policy in this regard. Indeed, I have  a  list of ships that have been imported, showing the purposes for which they have been imported, whether they have been imported for a short term one-off job or, if imported for a longer period, whether they have to be rebuilt. </para>
          <para>I would like to name just one or two of these ships. The reason I do so is to point out to the honourable member for Newcastle that I do not believe that he has an understanding of what is required in the fast changing technological shipping industry. </para>
          <para>For instance, the discovery of oil off the coast of Gippsland has caused a complete new set of problems in the Australian tanker-building industry. We had to import tankers to cope with the short term problem, but they are being replaced by Australian ships or replacements are being built for them. I will just name a few of the ships to which I have referred. The Bayou Chico&#39; came into Australia for a seismic survey. It was a specific short term survey task. In those circumstances it would have been quite irresponsible for me as Minister to ask that this task be fulfilled by an Australian-built ship. It was a short term, one job task and a proper survey was made of the Australian shipping industry to see whether there was available a ship comparable to the &#39;Bayou Chico&#39; that could have done the job. However, none was available. So, it is quite ridiculous for the honourable member to suggest that an Australian-built ship should be used for this task. </para>
          <para>The &#39;Coral Sea&#39;, which is a grab dredge, came in for a specific task at Cape Lambert. Exhaustive investigations were carried out to ascertain whether an Australianbuilt dredge was available for the task. The same remarks apply to the &#39;DB1&#39;, the DB2&#39; and to many others. One of the bigger ships to arrive here was the &#39;Ida Clausen&#39; which was brought to Australia as a transport for livestock. She was brought in on the assumption that there would be a building commitment when the viability of the operation was established. I say to the honourable member for Newcastle that it would be quite irresponsible of me, as Minister, to refuse to allow a company to bring in a ship and try it out to see whether or not the company could establish a long term operation. The company brought in this ship to see whether the operation is viable. If the operation is not viable, of course, the ship can be sent back overseas. It is on charter. The company can do this instead of investing a great deal of capital and losing it. We have used some imagination in our policy and we have given consideration both to the commercial interests involved and to the employment of the Australian fleet. </para>
          <para>The facts are that all the ships used on the Australian coastline have to meet very vigorous Australian conditions, and this is one of our difficulties. The honourable member for Newcastle talked so blithely about the use of Australian seamen and even Australian docks for repair work. He totally ignores the commercial considerations and the added costs that have to be incurred because of the vigorous conditions which ships are obliged to meet, and which have a consequential effect on Australian exporting industries. In regard to overseas ships, the honourable member for Newcastle talked about our getting a window into the Conference system. The fact is that we have had a window into the Conference system and it has proved to be a great success. The Australian Government has received interesting and useful information from it. For commercial reasons this information is not made public. We cannot publish everything that we learn. </para>
          <para>I shall mention one or two developments that have taken place as a result of our participation in the Conference system. The first is that the Australian National Line has joined with the Associated Container Transportation Ltd in setting up a pendulum service within the European Conference, and we believe that a much more viable, economic and efficient service will result from this venture. Our joining with ACTL has resulted from knowledge we have gained inside the Conference system. As I have said, we are using the Conference as a window. The second development is that a second ship, the &#39;Australian Explorer&#39; is joining the run on which the Australian Endeavour&#39; is engaged. We have the &#39;Australian Enterprise&#39; on the Japan run. We are engaged also in the Pacific Australia Direct Line, or PAD, service. The Australian overseas shipping industry, through the Australian National Line, has become very important to the economy of Australian exporting industries. </para>
          <para>We have completely protected the Australian coastal shipping industry. The industry is fully aware of the steps which have been taken to protect it, and I believe that the claims of the honourable member for Newcastle fall quite flat. The honourable member also referred to the use of overseas dry docks. Again, this is a commercial decision; it has to be taken by the people concerned. The facts are that, regrettably, some of the demarcation disputes and political disputes that occur in Australian docks increase costs so greatly that commercial interests are unable to meet the higher charges imposed by Australian docks. It is all very well to be nationalistic in approach, but there also has to be some realism. In his opening remarks the honourable member for Newcastle said that a reasonable amount of Australian ships or a reasonable amount of employment- </para>

I suggest to the honourable member that in point of fact the Australian Government is meeting the needs and the wishes of the industries involved. Both in the Australian coastal trade and in overseas trade I believe that our policy has been successful. The honourable member for Newcastle also referred to dredges. I believe that we have taken every precaution to ensure that Australian dredges are used wherever practicable. He referred to a one-off situation. As I say, we have taken every precaution. Most of the Australian dredges that are not being used at the moment are too small and inefficient to be able to undertake big jobs. </para>

I understood from the honourable member for Newcastle that the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> was going to table a report that has been eagerly awaited, by all sections of the shipping and shipbuilding industry, since it was first indicated, almost 3 years ago, that an investigation would be made into the shipbuilding industry.

He may have had some difficulties within the Government parties, and I would not expect him to mention those difficulties in the House. The Minister said - and I take it that he said it in good faith - that the report would be presented during this session of the Parliament. I can only conclude from that statement that there are some difficulties within the Government parties concerning the recommendations contained in the report. But this has further confused the position for the people in the industry who are expecting some assistance from the Government. </para>

            <para>- Why has the tabling of the report been delayed for 12 months? The Minister spoke for about 5 minutes before he referred to the questions raised in the matter of public importance. As I say, he said that he has not had time to prepare a statement on the report, and that he will release a statement after the House rises. The Minister mentioned a policy going back, I think, to just after World War I when ships were allowed to operate on the Australian coastline with the permission of the Minister. This policy has not been changed, but what has happened is that there is some laxity in the application of the policy. I am informed that 52 ships which have been built overseas are operating in the Australian interstate and intrastate trade at the present time when, as the honourable member for Newcastle has said, 17 ships of the Australian National Line are tied up. It seems to me that the Minister is lax in allowing these overseas vessels to operate on the Australian coastline. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the Minister has said, there are new types of vessels. There have been some changes in vessels and in their operations. I agree with him that it would be better to bring in a ship and allow it to operate for a while before building a replacement ship in Australia and manning it with an Australian crew. I do not think that the Minister will receive any opposition on this score from the Australian Labor Party or from the maritime unions. This has been our policy ever since the days when the Millers brought their first tanker to operate on the Australian coast line. I am not alone in my thoughts that the Minister is being lax in allowing overseas ships to operate on the Australian coast line. I refer to a report in the Brisbane &#39;Courier Mail&#39; of 2nd May in which the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron),</inline> who is a member of the Liberal Party, referred to the Government&#39;s policy and said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>My inquiries indicate that this policy is not beingstrictly applied, and extensions of permission to use imported vessels are frequently granted. </para>

          <para class="block">He referred to the &#39;Iron Cavalier&#39; and the Iron Clipper&#39; which are owned by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. The point is that there is a particular problem facing the Evans Deakin shipyard, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Griffith. This is an election year in both the Queensland and Commonwealth spheres and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I want to diverge for a minute because there is some concern about what is happening at the Evans Deakin shipyard and the possibility of the shipyard obtaining further orders. In fact on 6th May the Liberal Treasurer and  Deputy  Premier of Queensland said that the State Government was negotiating with the Commonwealth in an attempt to obtain forward orders for Evans Deakin. </para>
          <para>In shipbuilding there is a need for a definite programme of continuity so that people know where they stand. The industry can maintain a competent work force and it can train apprentices to take the place of those who drop out of the industry. It should not be one of stop and go where people are employed for a short period and then discharged. They may be picked up by or they may wander off into other industries and never come back. Evans Deakin has a particular problem. It has built a graving dock - primarily a construction dock - at the Kangaroo Point yards. There is a possibility that a bridge will be built across the river downstream from this shipyard. This will limit, to some extent, the size of vessels that can be built in that shipyard. </para>

              <para>- I thank the House. In shipbuilding and ship repair work there is always a system of job to finish and I hope that this is the way this debate will work out. According to a statistical report concerning Australian shipping and shipbuilding there are 13 dry docks in Australia, the newest of which were constructed during the war. The Cairncross Graving Dock in Brisbane was never completed to its original size, nor was the Captain Cook Graving Dock in Sydney. From the total number of dry docks can be deleted the Frank Nicklin Dock, which is a building dock, and the South Brisbane Government dry dock which will close shortly. In the post-war period there has been no construction of floating docks or graving docks in Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As the Minister for Shipping and Transport said, there have been technological changes in shipbuilding. Today ships are built deeper and wider and they draw more water. An article in the &#39;Courier Mail&#39; refers to the problems that will confront the &#39;Clutha Capricorn&#39; after it is launched at Evans Deakin shipyard. It will then enter the Cairncross dock. The article points out that it will be a tight squeeze. The ship is 835 feet long with a 106 foot beam and the Cairncross dock can accommodate a vessel up to 860 feet in length with a beam of 110 feet. This will give this vessel a 2 foot clearance on either side, so it will be a tight squeeze. </para>
          <para>I believe there is need for some action. I can understand the concern of the honourable member for Newcastle in this respect. In 1970 a deputation from Newcastle spoke to the State Minister for Works, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes,</inline> and asked that a new dock be built as quickly as possible at Newcastle. The Minister said that his last approach to the Commonwealth had been in 1969 when a British expert estimated that a graving dock would cost $20m. A Japanese team had designed a scheme which would cost half that amount. The Minister said that the graving dock planned by the Government would be 900 feet long, 150 feet wide and would take ships up to 100,000 tons dwt, which is by no means the largest ship operating on the overseas trade at present. The Minister said that because of the shortage of dry dock facilities in Australia he believed it vital for the New South Wales maritime industry to have a new graving dock built at Newcastle as quickly as possible and asked for a Commonwealth subsidy - a one-third shipbuilding subsidy and an additional one-third subsidy because of the significance of the dock to Australia as a whole. It is recognised that there is a need for a policy. The New South Wales Liberal Minister for Works agrees that there is a need. The Minister for Shipping and Transport has had time to study the report, even if he has not had time to make a statement. I look forward to his statement. I disagree with him that the present policy is in the best interests of the shipbuilding industry or of the operations of ships along the Australian coastline. </para>

              <para>It is not known how many persons actually became unemployed in each of the last five years as a result of automation or technological change. However, some indication can be gained from he series of National Surveys of the Employment </para>

          <para class="block">Effects of Technological Change which have been conducted in the last few years by my Department. The first four stages of this series have been completed  and covered manufacturing and tertiary industries. In these surveys, results obtained from 2,704 firms employing 937,000 persons, indicate that over a three year period 3,615 employees were retrenched as a result of technological change, a rate of retrenchment of 0.13 per cent per annum. It should not be assumed that all of the 3,615 employees experienced unemployment following retrenchment. My Department&#39;s studies indicate that some of those retrenched obtain other employment either immediately or after an interval. In fact quite a number of employers actively assist their employees in obtaining alternative work. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>There is a certain amount of discrimination against the older worker in Australia. The effect of this discrimination, and the age at which it may be experienced, varies according to occupation, industry, locality and the skill required; it is however not possible to specify its extent. Generally speaking, semi-skilled and unskilled workers and some categories of executives are likely to suffer most from this discrimination. The Commonwealth Employment Service, operated by my Department, seeks to counteract this prejudice, where it exists. The Commonwealth Employment Service encourages employers to recognise that many older workers bring to their employment experience, judgment and stable attitudes. Unless there is evidence that an individual&#39;s age has caused a decline in his capacity to perform a particular job, there is no reason why age _ should become an overriding factor in his selection. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>There is no national minimum award wage as such in Australia. However, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has inserted in Commonwealth awards provision for  a  minimum wage for adult males. The 6 State Capital Cities average minimum weekly wage for adult males under awards made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is at present $51.10 per week which is equivalent to $2,657.20 per annum. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>To ensure that a taxpayer with 2 dependants earning an income of $2,657.20 per annum is exempt from income tax on that income it would be necessary to exempt from tax taxable incomes up to and including $2,137, i.e., it would be necessary to raise the minimum taxable income to $2,138. It has been assumed that the 2 dependants maintained by the taxpayer are a wife and a child for whom the taxpayer would be entitled to  a  deduction from assessable income of $520 for a full year. </para>
          <para>The cost to revenue in a full year at levels of income estimated for the 1971-72 income year of raising the minimum taxable income to $2,138 is estimated at about $300m. </para>
          <para>In this estimate, allowance has been made for shading-in&#39;, i.e., a reduction in tax otherwise payable on taxable incomes somewhat higher than the amount of $2,137. The purpose of &#39;shading-in&#39; is to ease the transition from complete exemption from tax to liability for tax at normal rates. Under the &#39;shading-in&#39; arrangement assumed for purposes of the estimate, the tax payable on the excess of the taxable income is limited to 47 per cent, i.e., the approximate rate (after inclusion of additional tax payable under section 8 of the Income Tax Act 1971-72) to which the tax payable on income falling within the &#39;shading-in&#39; range under the present law is limited. Reduced tax therefore applies to taxpayers with taxable incomes up to the level at which the amount of tax calculated at normal rates equals the amount of tax payable under the &#39;shading-in&#39; arrangement. This level would be $3,087 if the assumptions made for the purpose of the estimate were realised. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>At present, general rates of tax, when combined with additional tax payable under section 8 of the Income Tax Act 1971-72, exceeding 50c per dollar apply to that part of an individual&#39;s taxable income which exceeds $10,000. If the combined rates were limited to 50c per dollar and applied to the parts in excess of $10,000 of taxable incomes estimated for the 1971-72 income year, the resulting full-year loss to income tax revenue would be approximately $75m. </para>

              <para>and (2) At the meeting at Memooloo it was indicated that the Post Office could provide exchange facilities at Toprain within twelve months if the applicants reached agreement on the construction of lines to the exchange point at their expense. However, they were unable to agree between themselves on this aspect. At a later meeting in Brisbane in August 1971 between the Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Queensland, and Members of Parliament who were pursuing the matter on behalf of the applicants, the offer was repeated as a temporary measure pending the provision by the Post Office of standard Departmental lines which could not be programmed for some years. </para>

          <para>The position now is that, in the current 3-year works programme, an amount of $20,000 has been allocated for the construction of a trunk line from Blackwater to Toprain for the establishment of exchange facilities at the latter centre. It is expected that the trunk line will be constructed by the end of the 1972-73 financial year and the work on subscribers&#39; line reticulation and supporting trunk line provision on main routes will then be undertaken, with completion of the project in its entirety being scheduled for 1975-76. However, when the Toprain trunk line is constructed, it is proposed to utilise it for the establishment of a public telephone in) the area so that a measure of service will be available to the residents pending connection of their services. </para>

              <para>Funds for the Post Office capital works are allocated to the various States as far as practicable in proportion to the demand for services and the physical capacity to meet the demand. However, it is not just a question of finance. The telephone system is complex and the provision of new services often involves the establishment of new exchanges and trunk line facilities, as in the case of Toprain. Projects of this nature, requiring as they do highly trained staffengineers, technicians and the like - must be preceded by detailed surveys and exchange area planning to ensure that available resources are utilised in the most effective manner. Even if unlimited funds were available, this would not in itself mean that telephone services could be installed in all instances without delay, since the ability to expand capital within a given period is dependent on the extent to which resources of skilled manpower and materials can be devoted to the task. </para>

However, it seems clear that, if an organisation were operating purely and simply as a business undertaking, it would not be prepared to provide telephone services in many of our rural areas. Rural telephone services are generally not an attractive financial proposition because of the heavy costs involved in their provision and maintenance for a relatively low revenue return. For example, in the Toprain case, total revenue was estimated in 1970 at $4,500 per annum for a capital investment of some $100,000. Such uneconomic projects can only be undertaken by the Post Office in its role as a public utility with the responsibility for providing telephone services in unprofitable as well as profitable areas. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The number of aerobridges which can be used is partly related to the aircraft type. </para>
            <para>For example, they are not suitable for F.27 aircraft. </para>

            <para>On the other hand, the Boeing 747 required 2 aerobridges and these are already provided at a limited number  of  positions in both Sydney and Melbourne. As the percentage of Boeing 747 operations increases the number of Boeing 747 positions with 2 aerobridges is being increased. </para>
            <para>Both TAA and Ansett Airlines of Australia are planning  to  effect major improvements  to  their domestic terminals at Sydney and your request for the provision  of  aerobridges will be brought to their notice. They also have in mind  to  increase the number  of  domestic aerobridges at Melbourne, for example, as the frequency, of use justifies the expenditure. </para>

            <para>-  The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The Department of the Interior has advised that an average of approximately 60 per cent of compulsorily transferred Public Servants are housed immediately on arrival in Canberra. This figure relates to the last 5 years as earlier statistics are either not reliable or readily available. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>I have been advised by the Public Service Board that because Government housing is allocated immediately where required, compulsorily transferred Public Servants do not qualify as a group for Regulation 97 allowance. As regards other Public Servants moving to Canberra, while actual figures are not readily available, it can be said that in almost all cases, Government housing is not made available immediately and therefore these officers would be entitled to Regulation 97 allowance pending the allocation of a Government house in the normal manner. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>and (4) The Department of the Interior has advised that an average waiting time for the allocation of a new 3-bedroom house during the last 10 years is about 3 years. It would be reason able to assume that the average waiting time for public servants in receipt of Regulation 97 allowance would be about the same. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>As the longest waiting time for a Government house was 42 months in the .10 year period, it is assumed that the longest time for which public servants were in receipt of Regulation 97 allowance would be the same. </para>
          <para>In relation to the remaining parts of the question the Public Service Board has advised: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>and (7) That records on which to base an answer to these questions are not available. But so far as sums payable under Regulation 97 are concerned Hansard, 27th August 1968, page 609 gives a figure of some $400,000 for the financial year 1966-67. Figures for 1968-69, 1969-70, 1970- 71 are in round figures $519,000, $637,000, $903,000 respectively. So far as the numbers of public servants receiving allowances are concerned a survey made in June 1971 produced a figure of 946 as at 30th June 1971. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(6)">
              <para>Payments under Regulation 97 are made only to the officer involved. (8), (9), (10) and (11) Regulation 97 payments are made on the basis of an upper rental limit which is fixed by the Public Service Board from time to time after a survey of the market of suitable available houses. Each officer contributes according to a scale based on what he might reasonably have been expected to pay if a suitable unfurnished house were available. The amount of contribution is greater for officers on higher salaries than for officers on lower salaries. The detailed procedures to be followed by Departments are set out in instructions issued by the Public Service Board. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Payment of a rental subsidy has never been restricted to officers occupying premises which have been fair rented following application under the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance. An officer choosing to rent premises above the rental limit set by the Public Service Board must normally bear the excess rental whether or not the premises are fair rented. The intention is to give an officer freedom to select premises which best meet his needs within the framework of an upper limit which is known to him. </para>
          <para>For a period which concluded in 1965 an officer in Canberra renting furnished premises which had been fair rented had applied to him a slightly higher upper rental limit for allowance assessment purposes. This arrangement was discontinued in 1965. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(12)">
              <para>There are no records or estimates available to allow a clear conclusion to be drawn on this point. It appears, however, that there was an increase of some 10 per cent in average Regulation 97 rental subsidy payments in Canberra between 1968 and 1971. A spot check in 1968 showed an average subsidy of SI 5.91 per week (see answer to Question No. 252, Hansard, 10th September 1968, page 878) and the Board&#39;s survey of June 1971 showed an average subsidy of $17.55 per week. </para>

            <item label="(13)">
              <para>Details are not available of the occupations of applicants for fair rents which would show whether there is any relationship between the lower number of applicants referred to by the honourable member and the changed practice introduced in 1965 as referred to above. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The National Health Act makes provision for the payment of Commonwealth medical benefits to contributors to registered medical benefits organisations who incur expenses in relation to services rendered by qualified medical practitioners, or prescribed medical services rendered by approved dentists. The Act does not cover services rendered by optometrists, nor does it provide for payment of a benefit towards the cost of spectacles. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>However, in order to avoid discrimination between patients in the allied fields of optometry and ophthalmology in cases where spectacle lenses are prescribed, the Act specifically excludes the payment of Commonwealth benefits for attendances by medical practitioners which result in the prescription of spectacles. In this way, the patient is left in the same position whether the spectacles are prescribed by an optometrist or an opthalmologist. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>From time to time, the Government has given consideration to extending the Health Benefits Plan so that it includes ancillary services but, to date, such an extension has not been practicable. As the honourable member will appreciate, any proposal for the provision of benefits in respect of any particular type of ancillary service requires to be considered in the light of claims for benefits over the whole range of ancillary services. This raises a major consideration, namely, the additional burden which would be placed on the Australian taxpayer who, in 1971-72, is expected to provide some $510m from the National Welfare Fund for health services. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>While the matter is thus kept under review, I cannot promise that any early action will be taken to include optometry in the plan. </para>
          <para>However, most health insurance organisations pay ancillary fund benefits where spectacles are prescribed, and pay fund benefits towards the cost of spectacles. The major organisations provide these benefits only where the services are rendered, or the spectacles are prescribed, by medical practitioners. Certain other organisations pay fund benefits for optometrical as well as medical practitioner prescriptions. The question of whether, or the extent to which, health insurance organisations pay such ancillary benefits is regarded as essentially a matter for decision by the managements of the organisations. </para>

          <para>I mention for the information of the honourable member that the Public Service Ordinance was amended in March 1972 by the Public Service (Promotion and Recruitment Procedures) Ordinance 1971. The Ordinance now provides for appointments, promotions and transfers in the Public Service of Papua New Guinea to be dealt with by selection committees whose decisions are not subject to appeal by officers. The new system is designed to speed up localisation and incorporates procedures under which local officers can be advanced to positions at higher levels solely on the basis of their efficiency and without the requirement to win promotion in competition with overseas officers.

              <para>Numerous representations have been made by interested parties over a period of more than 2 years on various aspects of the production of alcohol from grain and Its use for blending with automotive fuel. </para>

          <para>My Department has examined information, including reports prepared by various committees and research organisations, which has become available, mainly from Canada and the United States.

          </list>
          <para>Studies made in Canada and the United States in recent years have resulted in the conclusion that it would cost more to produce alcohol from grain, even if the grain were supplied free, than the current ex-refinery prices of petrol in the respective countries. A further aspect of these studies is that industrial alcohol cannot be produced from fermentable materials as cheaply as it can be synthesised from ethylene. For this reason virtually all industrial alcohol in most countries is derived from ethylene. </para>
          <para>It is apparent that grain growers could not expect to receive a remunerative price for grain sold for the production of industrial alcohol. </para>
          <para>Other factors to be considered, apart from technical aspects such as the comparative efficiency of normal automotive fuels and alcohol blends include: </para>

            <para>No. The section of the Public Service (Papua New Guinea) Ordinance 1963-1971 relating to preference in promotion, transfer or appointment for local officers has been repealed by the Public Service (Promotion and Recruitment Procedures) Ordinance 1971 (No. 11 of 1972). The latter Ordinance provides for a new system of selecting officers for promotion or transfer and for appointments to the Public Service. </para>
            <para>The new procedures require that all vacancies which are to be filled must be advertised. Applications are considered by Selection Committees consisting of a chairman (an officer of the Department of the Public Service Board), a representative of the department in which the vacancy exists and a representative of the appropriate staff association. The appropriate Committee is required to select the most efficient applicant within the Public Service for promotion or transfer to the vacancy. If an overseas officer is selected as the most efficient applicant the Committee is required to determine whether any local officer applicant has a level of efficiency which would enable him to satisfactorily carry out the duties of the office. If there is such a local officer applicant the Committee issues a &#39;localisation certificate&#39; in respect of that officer. Where there is more than one so qualified the Committee certifies the most efficient. The successful overseas officer is then promoted but transferred to another position of equivalent classification, and the local officer named in the &#39;localisation certificate&#39; is promoted to the advertised vacancy. The decision of a committee is not subject to appeal. </para>
            <para>In relation to appointment to the Public Service the new procedures provide that vacancies may be filled by recruitment from outside the Public Service only where there are no applications from within the Service or where the Selection Committee is satisfied that no internal applicant is suitable for the position. The engagement of overseas staff is limited to those categories of employment for which local persons with the required qualifications or experience are not available. </para>

        <para>The need to step up the Campaign was given even greater emphasis through the recent United States gazettal of restrictions on the import of meat from T.B. affected animals or from animals showing positive tuberculin reaction. In the light of that United States action, the decision was taken here to prohibit the export of such meat in any form from Australia to any destination. The Australian Meat Board has made submissions about the problems facing the cattle industry following that decision. The submission includes proposals for an Australia-wide scheme for compensation against loss occasioned by bovine tuberculosis. Graziers organisations have made similar representations. These various submissions are also being studied as a matter of urgency. </para>

              <para>No other reference in these specific terms was made. However, it has been general practice for many years for references to the Board to be made under Section 15 of the Tariff Board Act as a whole, which includes (Section 15 (1) (h)) the question of whether  a  manufacturer was taking undue advantage  of the  protection afforded by the Tariff in regard  to  charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods or acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public. </para>

              <para>I am not aware of any such undertaking being sought by  the  Government. The procedures followed  by the  Government in setting levels of protection are designed to ensure that tariffs are no higher than necessary to protect economic and efficient industry. The Tariff Board makes a very thorough examination of the protective needs of such industry. The Board makes recommendations on levels of protection which are the minimum necessary, having regard to prices of imports, to allow economic and efficient enterprises to realise a reasonable profit. This procedure appears to provide satisfactory safeguards against firms which obtain high protection being able to charge unduly high prices. </para>

            <para>- The  answer  to the hon  ourable  member&#39;s  question  is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) I understand that the idea has been canvassed with some industry organisations by a private person who is interested in such matters. Should private bodies or persons wish to form such an organisation then it is, of course, open to them to do so. If such a body were formed, and if it were representative of informed opinion on trade matters in Australia, then any advice it cared to give the Government would, of course, receive full and careful consideration. In 1958 the Government established two organisations through which it has since been able to obtain valuable advice from experienced and eminent businessmen on a wide range of matters including Australian trade. These organisations are the Export Development Council and the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council. </para>

              <para>The research programme on disinfestation treatments has been given high priority but it involves extensive, time consuming original research of considerable complexity. The major problems in this type of research are the laboratory breeding of insects, the determination of the stage of the pest (i.e., larvae, etc.) which is most resistant to the treatment, the artificial infestation of fruit and phytotoxicity studies. To meet the Japanese requirements research is necessary on the Mediterranean fruit fly as well as the Queensland fruit fly, and, although much work had already been carried out on the latter pest, no previous research had been undertaken in Australia on sterilisation treatments for Mediterranean fruit fly. </para>

            <para>No steps have yet been taken for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to review educational policy in Australia. Preparation for reviews has begun in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Turkey and the United Kingdom. On the average, less than two reviews have been completed each year, and the present review procedure is currently being reassessed within the Organisation. </para>
            <para>At this early stage of Australian membership of the Organisation, Australian education authorities are engaged in the process of gaining familiarity with the Organisation&#39;s varied activities in education and in determining the areas in which Australian participation would be most valuable. Until such over-all assessments are made and priorities established, and any new forms of review established as a result of the current discussions within the Organisation are known, it would be premature for a decision to be made on the question of Australian participation in the programme of country educational policy reviews. </para>

            <para>The OECD has recently concluded an examination of the directions that its future activities should take in relation to science and technology in Member countries. The Organisation is now planning to give greater emphasis to studies of selected aspects of science and technology which are of mutual interest and importance to a group of its Member countries. It appears that less emphasis will be given in future to studying in isolation the scientific and technological situation in individual Member countries. The activities of the OECD in relation to science and technology are being keptunder review. Continuing assessment will be made of their relevance and expected value to the development of science and technology in Australia. </para>

            <para>Information is not available to answer this part of the honourable member&#39;s question. The only statistics now compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician in respect of semi-government authorities as a group separate from other State government departments and authorities are those shown in the annual Bulletin, &#39;Local and Semi-Government Authorities Debt&#39; (that is, relating to debt outstanding, annual interest liability, new money loan raisings, funds provided for redemption of debt and accumulated sinking fund charges). For purposes of that Bulletin, semi-government authorites are defined as those State government bodies other than local government authorities which have independent borrowing powers and which have in fact exercised these powers in borrowing from the public under the provisions of the Gentlemen&#39;s Agreement. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>This is regarded as an adequate definition for the purposes of debt and related statistics, but the Statistician considers that it would not be a satisfactory definition on which to compile other statistics, such as of semi-government revenues and expenditures, for the reason that there are in existence a number of bodies which have not borrowed but which would normally be regarded as semi-government authorities. A satisfactory alternative definition has not been found, the difficulty being to devise adequate criteria for distinguishing between State government departments and similar authorities on the one hand and State semi-government authorities on the other hand. </para>
        <para>Figures of semi-government revenue have been supplied in answer to previous questions by the honourable member, but these have not been based on a consistent and otherwise adequate definition of what constitutes a semi-government authority. The Statistician is, therefore, no longer compiling such statistics. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) An examination concerning the Inclusion of paramedical services within the scope of the National Health Scheme was commenced in the Department of Health following the Government announcement of its decisions on recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance (Nimmo Committee). I announced in the House in June 1970 that all paramedical services would be objectively examined and priorities determined to enable decisions to be taken by the Government to include specific types in the Scheme. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a wide range of paramedical services, including physiotherapy, optometry,- home nursing, chiropody, speech therapy, etc. Because of the diverse nature of these services and the interrelationships between them and medical and hospital treatment and Commonwealth and State financial arrangements, it will be appreciated that there are many implications associated with introduction of Insurance benefits <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this area which must all be given full consideration. </para>
          <para>The examination is proceeding but at this stage I cannot indicate when it will be completed. </para>

              <para>I understand that the 1971-72 Annual Report of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations contains statements along the lines suggested by the honourable member. The statements are based upon a review of the world literature on this subject, current in 1966, which was made as a preliminary to a survey of the smoking habits of Australian schoolchildren, conducted by an hoc sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council and published by Council in 1969. They do not refer to the results of the Australian study. The full text of the sub-committee&#39;s conclusions, which generally support the literature review, is as follows: </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The National Health Act, under which medical and hospital benefits organisations are registered, does not specify any matters in relation to investments other than that the organisations must furnish the Director-General of Health with such financial accounts and statements as he requires  to  prepare his annual report under Section 76a. Section 76a (fi) specifies that the report shall include &#39;details  of  how the reserves of the fund have been invested&#39;. 1 have recently tabled the report in respect of the 1970-71 financial year. No regulations have been promulgated in relation to investments by health insurance organisations. </para>
            <para>On 27th October 1971, in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> the Minister  for  Health summarised the policy adopted in regard to investments made by health insurance organisations. </para>
            <para>The following is the text of the reply the Minister gave on that occasion - </para>
            <para>The reserves of medical and hospital benefits organisations are held in various forms. These include cash at bank, short term money market, bank fixed deposits, Commonwealth bonds and inscribed stock, semi-government bonds, local government shares, debentures and mortgages. Most funds hold a very high proportion of their reserves in trustee type investments. </para>
            <para>The various types of investments held are such that sufficient funds are always available to meet any contingencies in regard to the payment of claims. While there has been some investment in industrial type stock by some organisations, these have generally yielded satisfactory results. </para>
            <para>The Government examined the question of the investment policies of organisations when considering the recommendations made by the Commonwealth Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance (Nimmo report). It concluded that funds had generally exercised a proper sense of responsibility in the assessment of reserves and that non-trustee investments have provided good returns to the advantage of contributors. The Government therefore decided that the policies followed by organisations in regard to investments should continue without the imposition of specific restrictions&#39;. (Senate Hansard, pages 1485-1486). </para>

            <para>Immediate effects on tax revenue can arise in relation to all forms of income flowing from Australia to the other country concerned in an agreement and from that country to Australia. However, it is not practicable to provide readily a reliable quantitative estimate of those immediate effects. </para>
            <para>As the terms of the honourable member&#39;s question imply, double taxation agreements have longer-term effects also- however, these too do not easily lend themselves to the processes of identification and quantification. </para>

              <para>Details of the number of overseas owned companies engaged in beef raising and handling activities are not compiled separately.

Even then companies predominantly engaged in beef raising and handling would be classified to one or other of the industry groups &#39;agriculture, forestry and fishing&#39;, &#39;commerce&#39; or &#39;transport, storage and communication&#39;, depending on whether the company in question is engaged in the breeding, transport or slaughtering aspects of the industry. However, it is not possible from data currently collected in the surveys of overseas investment to separately identify all the companies engaged in these activities. Moreover, the confidentiality provisions of the Census and Statistics Act would preclude the release of the names of individual businesses. </para>

              <para>Difficulties in controlling banana weevil borer were first reported in 1968. Since that time State Departments of Agriculture have been investigating control measures. The reports available to my Department indicate that much of the damage attributed to banana weevil borers was, in fact, due to nematodes which damage the root system of the plant. Moreover, plants affected by nematodes are much more susceptible to banana weevil borer. The investigations have also demonstrated the value of plantation sanitation, trapping and cultural practices in the control of the pest. Although resistant insects are present in New South Wales, the occurrence of dieldrin resistant borers in Queensland has not been confirmed. </para>

            <para>Neither the Bureau of Transport Economics nor the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads has carried out any specific economic valuations in connection with the roads between Canberra and the centres mentioned. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads is, in conjunction with State and local authorities, at present carrying out an Australian Road Survey. The road improvement projects shown to be desirable by that survey will be evaluated to assess if they are economically justified in the same way as the Bureau of Roads assessed the economic justification of the programme prepared after the 1967-68 Survey, (n addition, as I indicated in the House on 30th May (in reply to a question without notice by the Member for Hume), my Department will confer with the Department of the Interior and wilh New South Wales authorities to see if it is desirable that a study be carried out concerning the carriage of goods between Yass and Canberra. </para>
