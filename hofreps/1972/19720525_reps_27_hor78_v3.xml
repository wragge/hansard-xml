        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That on 10th December 1948, Australia signed the &#39;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#39;, Article 25 reads: &#39;Everyone has the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age and other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.&#39; </para>
        <para>Yet, 23 years later, in our country of great national wealth and abundance it is to the nation&#39;s shame that many thousands of our people live in  a  state of being inconsistent with the dignity and worth of the human person - languishing in poverty and want, neglect and the lack of proper care necessary for their health and well-being. </para>
        <para>We, the undersigned, respectfully draw to your attention that the conscience of the nation is not at ease while the records of our country show that social services are not comparable with that of other advanced countries administering such services, therefore, we call upon the Commonwealth Government to immediately legislate for: </para>
        <para>Base pension rate - 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings, all states, plus supplementary assistance and allowances based on a percentage of such earnings. Unemployed benefits equal to the foregoing. </para>
        <para>Completely free health services to cover all needs of social service pensioners - hospitalisation, chronic and long-term illness, fractures, anaesthetics, specialist, pharmaceutical, hearing aids, dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropody, surgical aids and any other appliances. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth Government to promote  a  comprehensive national scheme in cooperation with the States and make finance available to provide for the building of public hospitals, nursing and hostel-type homes necessary to effectively meet the special requirements of aged people, in conjunction with a comprehensive domiciliary care program to enable aged people to stay in their homes. </para>
        <para>Mental illness placed in the same position as physical illness. </para>
        <para>Substantial Commonwealth increase in the $5 subsidy a day per public bed pensioner patient in general hospitals. </para>
        <para>Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenues to local government for general activities which now include social welfare, health, conser vation and other community needs. Commonwealth subsidy for the waiving of rates for pensioners. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth Government to increase the non-repayable grant to the States for low rental home units for pensioners. </para>
        <para>Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia&#39;s social welfare structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the statement made by the right honourable gentleman at the end of last year that the increase in subsidies for nursing homes which he announced then was an interim measure. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Is he aware that the flow on from recent increases in nurses salaries granted by the Public Service tribunal in Tasmania last month has placed the future of homes for the aged in that State in jeopardy? In view of the fact that the last increase was classed as an interim measure, I ask the Prime Minister whether urgent consideration will be given to further assistance so that these homes will be able to remain open and continue with their great humanitarian work. </para>

            <para>- The Government did announce that the measures taken towards the end of last year would be only interim measures. Since then we have been carefully considering the problem associated with both nursing homes and nursing attention in homes. This is regrettably a very complicated and difficult problem. There have been several discussions of the matter in Cabinet or Cabinet committees and we are rapidly approaching the stage where I believe we will be able to make another statement about it. Regrettably too, we will not be able to make any Government statement relating to it in the House, but I will ensure that a statement is made public just as soon as I can get final decision on it. I think the honourable memberwill realise too that there is a pretty clear association between hospitalisation, nursing home attention and nursing attention in the  homes themselves. So we will have a lot of negotiating to do with the States. Nevertheless, I repeat what I said to the honourable member previously: We are anxious to come to a resolution of this problem and I will try to get the answer as soon as I can. </para>

            <para>- In the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; this morning there is a report which gives the substances of charges made last night in the House by the honourable member for Hughes. I would like to correct the report and say that it was with reference to the honourable member for Hughes - not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Johnson,</inline> the Administrator of Papua New Guinea, whose photograph appears. However, the remarks made by the honourable member for Balaclava, who is a member of the Public Works Committee, in answering fully the charge were not reported nor was my reply reported. </para>

          <para>To set the record straight I would like to give the substance of this matter. The Public Works Committee had a hearing in Western Australia to inquire into the Navy&#39;s requirements for land for its naval installation purposes on Garden Island. During that hearing the Navy made a public statement of its expected requirements and indicated that the matter was under study at the time and it could possibly make more land available. In consultation with the Prime Minister and the Naval Board the decision was made that some additional land could be made available. This decision was conveyed immediately to the Public Works Committee which, it so happened, without our knowledge was then sitting in private. The information was expected and anticipated by the Public Works Committee, as indicated in its report which is before the House. This information was given as information which the public had a perfect right to know. It was information of Government decision. This apparently was received while the Committee was sitting in private. Some honourable members imagined therefore that it was privileged and privy to the Committee. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware that I indicated that an inter-departmental committee was giving any consideration to telephone charges in any aspect. I did suggest publicly that my Department was in fact looking at this particular matter and in due course would inform me. Of course, this would be confidential information between the officers of the Department and the Minister. It would then be for me to make a judgment whether I took the matter to the Prime Minister or to Cabinet so that there could be a Government decision in relation to the content of the report. I do not hold out any real hope of adjustments in charges for the benefit of decentralised industry in Australia. I think ft is impossible to draw a distinction between what we term decentralised industry and private individuals in the same area with a telephone. Therefore, it is a matter on which I would not hold out any great hope of benefit. </para>

          <para>However, it must be remembered - and unfortunately many things are readily forgotten - that in 1958-59, when the extended local service area scheme was introduced, the area for local calls was increased from 80 square miles to 800 square miles. The number of trunk calls made was reduced by 45 per cent and it was only 3 years ago, I think, that the number of trunk calls being made in Australia returned to the number being made prior to 1958-59. Additionally, there were reductions in trunk call charges and at the maximum level, if my memory is correct, the charge was reduced from 25s to 18s which, I think honourable members would agree, was at that time a very substantial reduction. </para>

Is the Minister aware that the South Australian State Government is stretching its resources to the utmost in carrying out 3 major roadwork projects in the sparsely populated areas of western and northern South Australia, namely the Flinders Highway, the Eyre Highway and the Stuart Highway? Does he not consider that the efforts of the South Australian Government to seal these roads is worthy of more support from the Federal Government instead of repeating his statements on the supposedly generous allocation to South Australia under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, especially when it is noted that up to- </para>

            <para>- The first point I make is that the Commonwealth does not provide all the finance that is available to the States for their road construction programmes. In fact, the Commonwealth provides approximately one-third of South Australia&#39;s requirements. I think it is fair to say that all the States received acclaimed the Commonwealth aid roads programme when it was announced about 2 years ago. They were thoroughly delighted with the increase of finance from about $750m to $ 1,200m for the 5-year programme. South Australia as well as the other States enjoyed the increase. For the 5-year programme, South Australia will receive from the Commonwealth $120m. As I pointed out yesterday, just under $14m of this money is available for rural arterial roads - the very roads about which the honourable member for the Northern Territory spoke yesterday. As well, South Australia will receive a supplementary grant of $9m which, apart from Western Australia, which receives a supplementary grant of $41m and Tasmania which, I think, receives a grant of $2&#163;m, the eastern States do not share. So, in point of fact, the Commonwealth has been very generous to South Australia in the money allocated to that State under the Commonwealth aid roads programme. In regard to the other part of the honourable member&#39;s question, the South Australian Government sets its own priorities on the way that money should be spent. For my part, I would like to see that Government do more and meet more of its responsibilities in regard to both the Eyre Highway and the road from Port Augusta to Alice Springs. The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction in the matter. It is a matter for the South Australian Government and it must live up to its responsibilities and do the job properly. </para>

            <para>- The second 5-year programme for national water resources which provided for an allocation of $10Om is to supplement the work undertaken by the States in this field and, in some cases, to give them the opportunity to expedite works which they are already undertaking. In many cases, the projects which are undertaken are mostly joint projects. The position at present is that the applications that have been received under the second 5-year pro gramme exceed in aggregate the total of $100m, which is the amount the Commonwealth has approved for allocation for this purpose. Each project is examined on its merits and an expert feasibility study is undertaken by personnel in my Department. At the present time I could not state the exact amount that so far has been allocated under the second programme except perhaps to say that Queensland has benefited substantially in the approval of projects including one in the Bundaberg area which the honourable member knows quite well and also the border rivers scheme at Pike Creek. I say that merely in passing because I know the honourable member has a special interest in that matter. I will obtain the exact details in relation to the allocations so far and will let the honourable member have precise information regarding the amounts for Queensland which have been approved and where possible those which are still in the pipeline at the moment. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Prime Minister who will recall that a few days ago I asked a question about the Government&#39;s attitude to the proposed takeover of Rocla Pipes Ltd by Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd. This takeover or merger, if consummated, would appear to reduce or eliminate competition and to result in substantial overseas ownership of the merged company. In view of the statement made yesterday by the Government on mergers, will the Government examine this proposal to ascertain whether it would contravene the announced intentions of the Government and, if it would do so, in advance of the passing of any proposed legislation will the Government take such action as it can to discourage or prevent the takeover? </para>

This is something we would all like to see. I hope only that the statements made to me turn out to be correct. I can now make it clear that, so far as competition is concerned, Humes Ltd will have a major share of the Australian market and that there will be at least some competition between 2 Australian corporations. Nonetheless the Government has this matter under very careful consideration. I can say only that these are the facts which have been disclosed to me so far. Treasury is still considering the matter and as soon as it has made a report to me I will submit it to the Government. </para>

          <para>I should also let the honourable member know that we could not take this matter to the monopolies commission which the Government is establishing because yesterday&#39;s paper was put down for the purpose only of inviting discussion. T hope there is the fullest discussion on this matter and that in one way or another the House will be given an opportunity to discuss in full this question of takeovers. 1 like to see a maximum Australian ownership and this is a policy of the Government. We will do all in our power to achieve this but we will do it consistently with the national interest, which must be of paramount importance. The Government must take into consideration also the interests of Australian shareholders and make certain that what it does is based in sound knowledge of those interests.

He will recall also that he indicated in his answer that the Attorney-General&#39;s statement on monopolies and mergers would make explicit the Government&#39;s attitude to takeover bids such as the bid for Travelodge. ls it a fact that the new trade practices legislation will not come into operation for at least 3 months? Further, is there a distinct possibility that this legislation will remain on the Notice Paper during the whole of the Budget session?

              <para>- The honourable member referred to a wide series of fields throughout Australia. He referred to the fact that he regarded women as having been treated as second class citizens. He may well be surprised to learn that I agree with him that in many areas of this country, particularly in industry, women have been treated as second class citizens in the sense that they have not been accorded those opportunities which, certainly, they ought to have been accorded having regard to the talents they have and the contributions that they can make to industry at present. This is certainly so of the executive level of many large companies. Women, frankly, have not had the opportunities which many large companies ought to have provided to them. This is a matter of concern to my Department because it represents underemployment in the Australian community. My Department is involved in a number of diverse areas in an attempt to correct the present situation. I refer, of course, in the first place to the programme which seeks to provide women with opportunities to return to the work force. The honourable gentleman is well aware of the details of that programme. I think secondly - if the honourable gentleman will listen to the point which is being explained to him - of the many areas of activity of the Women&#39;s Bureau. Rather than weary the House on this point I will be happy to provide the honourable gentleman with a detailed written answer. </para>

            <para>- This is not a &#39;Dorothy Dix&#39; question, but I had been informed that such a question was to be asked. It is quite true to say that the dimension of Australian rural industry, as a dominant part of our Australian exports, is less than it was some years ago. It has been replaced by minerals and by manufactured goods. But primary products are still our major export earner, and primary industries are the basis of the economy of most of inland Australia. They are very important to the livelihood of millions of people living in country towns and cities. But this nation, being a great trading nation - a nation which has very heavy import demands - needs to earn foreign exchange. While we have those heavy demands on imports we will always have to rely very heavily on agricultural exports to earn this income. It is quite wrong to underestimate the significance of rural exports for this nation&#39;s continuing progress and for the high standard of living we maintain today. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister for Social Services. He has received from me representations regarding a 58- year old invalid pensioner, who has a wife who is also aged less than 60, who receive between them a pension of $52 a fortnight, which is $104 every 4 weeks. As this man as the Minister knows, has severe silicosis with extreme breathlessness, uses $70 worth of oxygen a month and pays rent of $9 a week - making a total of over $106 a month - how does the Minister suggest that this couple should exist? </para>

            <para>- In the first place the Leader of the Opposition well knows that the carriage of wool is a matter for negotiation between the wool owners, after the point of purchase, and the shipping lines. That clarifies my own position in this matter as the Minister in charge of the Australian National Line. Insofar as the activities of the ANL are concerned, the Leader of the Opposition will know also that the real purpose of the Government in putting the ANL back into the overseas fleet was to enable the Government to know the effect on and cost of shipping to Australian exporting industries. I am positively certain after its 2 or 3 years experience that the Australian nation is, for a couple of reasons, much better off as a result of ANL intervention. The first reason is that we are better informed about the European run. I think it is true to say that some of the good things that have come out of the changes in freight rates could well have resulted from the ANL entering into that conference. On the Japan run, the ANL is a member of the conference and contributes thoroughly and very efficiently to the carriage of goods by the conference. I conclude my answer in the way I began, by reminding the Leader of the Opposition that it is a matter for negotiation between the owners of the wool at the point of its departure ,ind the shipping companies. I shall look at the implications of the question asked by the honourable gentleman about what further steps the ANL could take separately. If there is anything to add to what 1 have said already I will inform him. </para>

            <para>- It is quite interesting to note the degree to which within the Opposition there is a desire to establish the peasant farmer concept in Australia. The objective of questions raised in the Parliament consistently has been to produce for wool growers and primary producers  a  minimal return, a return which is so low that those in country areas would be unable to operate profitably. Essentially the Government has provided help through the wool price support scheme for all growers. As my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry described this morning, it has provided help in such a way that the wool industry, in its role with primary industry abroad, is contributing significantly to Australia&#39;s export earnings. The Government has provided for that industry an underpinning which has enabled it to pull through the extremely difficult times which it had ahead of it 12 months ago. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has not distinguished between the small wool grower and the big wool grower in providing financial assistance. It has provided help to get the whole industry back on its feet again. For commercial reasons it is not thought proper to publish individually the amounts that have been paid to each of those who have received assistance. However, I shall look at that part of the honourable gentleman&#39;s question and if I believe that in the circumstances the amounts have been paid to the 2 specific companies to which he referred can be made available I shall make the information available. But I can see some difficulties in publishing details of the recipients of each of the contributions throughout Australia. I think it is essential that this House and the people of Australia recognise that the wool industry is a diverse industry. It consists of big growers and little growers. It is an industry which contributes significantly to the Australian economy. If the industry is to survive it has to be looked at as a whole. We in the Government are seeking the maintenance of a profitable farming community. A profitable farming community depends on individual wool growers being able to generate sufficient returns from their activities to enable them to maintain a reasonable position in relation to others in the economic structure of this nation. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. As much has been said regarding the presentation of White Papers, green papers or perhaps papers of some other shade of colour, I ask: Is it necessary, for instance, to use the name &#39;White Paper*, which gives no indication of what the paper is intended to convey and is so named probably because parliaments used the term long before this Parliament was founded? I ask: Will the right honourable gentleman make investigations with a view to having more up to date procedure adopted m the presentation of these papers? </para>

              <para>- I can give an example of what I think should be done. I refer to the statement made by the Minister for Defence relating to the total defence outlook and the attitudes that were adopted. This statement was probably in the nature of what might have been called in British parlance a Green Paper. I do not think that is suitable to Australian conditions, so we arranged for it to be called a Defence Paper. Equally too, in the case of the paper which was produced recently relating to the international capital flows, we decided that we would call this matter Treasury Paper No. 1. I think that these titles are appropriate. They clearly indicate the type of paper that it is. If the Government itself wants to make a policy decision then I think the Government should clearly indicate that the paper is one relating to policy and we should give it an appropriate title and make it clear that it relates to policy. That is why we are giving papers such names. </para>

The Minister will recall that because of the bulldog tenacity of the late Rod Miller he suceeded in breaking the overseas oil company monopoly of the coastal oil tanker trade. Will the Minister give honourable members an assurance that even if Ampol Pty Ltd succeeds with its takeover bid for R. W. Miller Pty Ltd, the oil companies will not be permitted to reintroduce foreign owned and manned tankers on to the Australian coast, even if it means directing the Australian National Line to build tankers for the coastal tanker trade? </para>

I can give that assurance. The policy of the Australian Government in this regard is well known - that is, to encourage the use of Australian flag vessels on the Australian coast both in the freight and oil carriage sections. Therefore, I can give that assurance. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Industry. The Minister will be aware that the recent report of the Special Advisory Authority on manmade fibre yarn recommended a temporary duty of 45c per lb in addition to the previous 29 per cent duty. Does the Minister realise that the report contained no estimate of the ad valorem equivalent of this specific 45c per lb duty, and without this information it is difficult for a layman to understand the significance of the recommendation? Will the Minister take this matter up with the Special Advisory Authority to see whether future reports can contain similar most elementary and vital information without which a rational discussion of the report is almost impossible? </para>

              <para>- I took it to mean that if it is to be a specific rate it should be in terms of the ad valorem percentage. This is hard for the  Chairman  to do, because basically what he has to do is to examine an industry in a very short time to see whether Australian industry is being damaged or is under threat of damage, and to see what action should be taken. When I make a reference to the Special Advisory Authority, the Authority is required within 30 days to make a report. The  Chairman  uses the simplest formula to give protection, and not necessarily an economic analysis of the level of protection that ought to be given; that is a matter for the Tariff Board. Always when the Tariff Board makes its assessment of the level of protection it is given in ad valorem terms. </para>

            <para>- I have seen a copy of the recommendations of the New Zealand Wool Board. The New Zealand wool industry recognises, as the Australian wool industry does, the changing market circumstances which beset the wool trade today. At the same time I think it should be said that New Zealand wool is essentially different from Australian wool but together we work through the International Wool Secretariat and together we share a great deal in facing competition from synthetic fibres. I believe that the steps announced in New Zealand illustrate that in New Zealand, as m Australia, there is this momentum towards change to make the industry more competitive in the future. I think that it will be of interest to us in our deliberations on the recommendations of the Australian Wool Industry Conference to consider the steps that have been taken on the other side of the Tasman. </para>

        <para>By way of amplification of the motion, I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jeffrey</inline> Penfold-Hyland,  president  of the Federal Wine and Brandy Producers Council of Australia, has said that the growth rate of wine sales has dropped by 0.2 per cent in 1970-71, which is a long way below the growth rate of soft drink and beer consumption. It is important that the House have an opportunity to debate the situation. The Government&#39;s own advisers warned the Government that if it imposed this iniquitous excise, wine sales would drop by 20 per cent. The situation is that the Government has been told by its own advisers, by the Australian Wine Board, by the Federal Grape Growers Council, by the Winemakers&#39; Association - in fact by everyone connected with this industry - that the excise is damaging. If we are to go into recess without debating the matter, we will ignore the whole industry. </para>

            <para>- Care is a great challenge always. There is a very urgent reason why the House should agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. The situation is that new evidence has been presented by the industry, and unless we agree to this motion honourable members will not have an opportunity to debate the position at all. There has been further support in the industry for the abolition of the tax, as appears from the terms of the motion. However, I quote also in support of my motion the motion that still appears on the notice paper under the name of the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles).</inline> I should like to quote this motion to the House. Honourable members will be well aware that the honourable member for Angas on 25th November moved: </para>

        <para class="block">The background to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders this morning is that I and my colleagues moved the suspension of Standing Orders at that time to enable the House to debate the motion moved by the honourable member for Angas which was vital to the industry.

        <para>The other point that supports very strongly the carrying of the motion I have moved this morning is the fact that the Grant report is one of a series of 6 reports. Actually, this is the Government&#39;s report on its 2 previous reports, which I would say is quite a feat of dexterity on the part of the Government. However, the main point is that the report which has been completed and which is in the hands of the Minister has not been released. We are going into the wilderness for 2i months. We may or may not see this report. We may or may not have an opportunity to examine it and to challenge its conclusions, if any. I stress that we do not even know what is in the report. It is absolutely vital that the Parliament as a whole has an opportunity to hear from the Government at this eleventh hour what it intends to do about the report on which the Government has hung the whole o. its policy. On several occasions recently, the Government has indicated that perhaps the wine excise could be reduced by half. I am just trying to point to the- </para>

            <para>- I am trying very hard to do just that. I am trying to point out that if we do not suspend Standing <inline font-style="italic">Orders</inline> this morning the report to which I have referred will not come before the Parliament at a very vital period. This is the crux of my motion to suspend Standing Orders this morning. It is the only opportunity we have to bring the report before the Parliament. If this is not done now, we will have to wait <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> months and all sorts of things will be happening. It will be a vital time for the wine industry. This has been stated by the federal leader of the industry. It also would give us an opportunity in the Parliament to test the statement by the Leader of the industry that both the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the Minister for Primary Industry have made misleading statements. Surely the Ministers must be concerned that they have been challenged on their statements on this matter. 1 am saying to them quite frankly this morning that we would like to clear up the great doubts which exist as to the intention of the Government. We would very much like to examine in depth the statements to which I have referred only in passing. We have not had this opportunity and, as you very rightly pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> we do not have in the narrow confines of this debate the opportunity to test the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Penfold</inline> Hyland that the 2 Ministers have been misleading and deceiving on this issue. I think that it is in the interests of the industry and of all the people concerned that we have this opportunity to clear up the situation and to establish it precisely. &#91; referred in the first instance to the reasons why we should do it now. I appeal to the Government supporters to agree to a suspension of Standing Orders and I appeal to the honourable members - there are 11 of them - who represent wine grape growers to find some courage on this issue, stand with us and have the debate. We are not asking those honourable members to bring down the Government but simply to suspend Standing Orders. I put it forward in a most reasonable way so that we can clear up very serious doubts which exist at this time about a most important industry. </para>

            <para>- Has the honourable member finished? The reason that the Standing Orders contain such a provision is to enable what is being attempted in the House this morning. I attended a meeting with the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who virtually gave that meeting an undertaking that, before the House rose for the winter recess, there would be available to the House and to the industry per medium of debate in this place a full report of the inquiry that he had promised on that occasion would be undertaken and expedited. I refer of course to the Grant Report. Public statements have been made by honourable members which support very strongly the carrying of the motion to suspend Standing Orders this morning. Those statements have been made by honourable members who have a vested interest in misleading many of their electors in regard to this matter, namely, the imposition of the wine tax. </para>

            <para>- I think that the motion to suspend Standing Orders should be carried this morning in order to let the people in the wine industry in South Australia know that at least their objections to the wine tax would be permitted to be debated once again in this chamber. Surely the Minister for Primary Industry should support and take notice of this motion if he recalls the very strong statements he made in regard to this matter at a meeting of wine grape growers and representatives of the industry at Berri earlier this year. Surely the industry spokesmen should not be ignored. For that reason alone there should be a recognition in this place at the importance of this measure by carrying the motion, so that the views of the industry could be put forward. </para>

The remarks of the Minister for the Army on the quiet in this place are mostly disgraceful. This House should not deny the passage of this motion which is for the purpose of ventilating in this place all the shortcomings of Government supporters and their complete abdication of responsibility towards others. This applies particularly to the honourable members for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> and Barker, /ho have broken promises that have been made at various meetings, particularly in the electorate of Angas. This has not applied so much to the electorate of Barker, if at all. Those honourable members have adbicated their responsibilities towards the people who live in those places. </para>

I feel quite strongly about the fact that one has to stand in support of a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders when the Government should accept the responsibility for having the matter now sought to be discussed brought before the House in a right and proper manner, as it is endeavouring to do in the last hours of this Parliament in relation to the wool industry. </para>

            <para>- We have before us a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable us to discuss the excise on wine. This is a matter which is of concern to many honourable members in this House and particularly to those honourable members who are from wine grape producing electorates. There are on this side of the House a number of honourable members who have persistently and consistently asked questions in this place on this subject. They have worked within the industry and outside it in an effort to determine the problems of the wine grape producers. These honourable members, unlike honourable members on the other side of the House, have tried to look at the economics of the industry. If we are to have a suspension of Standing Orders we need first to determine the degree to which there is a requirement for the Standing Orders to be suspended to enable a debate on a matter which, it is suggested by honourable members on this side of the House, needs continued economic examination, and by those on the other side of the House, political examination. All that has happened in relation to the wine excise so far as honourable members on the other side of the House are concerned - </para>

            <para>- If we are to suspend Standing Orders we need to make sure that the purpose of the suspension is the fulfilment of an examination of the realistic problems of the industry. I can assure honourable members that there will be an announcement of the Governments decision with respect to the wine excise at the appropriate time. Similarly, there will be an announcement of decisions relative to the problems of the wine industry. It is pointless at this stage to suspend Standing Orders in order to discuss a matter which has been so blown up in politics by the honourable member for Riverina that the economic issues which are significant and important have been completely ignored. According to the degree to which one looks at the tax structure in Australia it is obvious that every taxpayer is concerned with the incidence of taxation as it affects him. This is as true of the wine excise as it is of probate; it is as true of personal income tax as it is of sales tax. Every revenue raising device used by government affects the individual who has to pay for it. Of course it is true that each of us as a representative in this House is concerned as an individual taxpayer and as a representative of others, about how those taxes affect us and our constituents. But to suspend Standing Orders in order to look at this particular tax will deny the right of those who are concerned with the broad problems of the industry to examine those problems in a fit and proper place. </para>

        <para>I have given an undertaking that the Grant report will be released as soon as possible and this undertaking will be fulfilled. I can assure honourable members also, if they can be patient, that they will be advised of the Government&#39;s decision on the Grant report. I can see no justification for a debate at this time on the matter which the honourable member has raised. I cannot see any reason for the suspension of Standing Orders and I believe that the degree to which this matter has been blown up in a political way has denied the very real need for an examination of the problems of wine grape producers on a broad basis rather than on a political basis. What we on this side of the House - and particularly the honourable member for Angas, in relation to the wine co-operatives in the Murray River areas which certainly have had problems in their flagon sales - is to try to show-- </para>

            <para>- It is obvious that there needs to be an opportunity for honourable members to consider this matter in relation to the Grant report and I believe that at this stage the problems cannot be effectively analysed without it. I can assure the House that this opportunity will be provided shortly. The Government&#39;s decision on the matter will be made at an appropriate time and I can assure honourable members who are genuinely concerned with the problem of the wine grape industry that it is not just a matter of wine excise. There are re lated problems quite outside the wine excise, problems such as Britain&#39;s entry into the European Economic Community, contracting export market opportunities and import competition in Australia. All these are factors very appropriate to the wine industry. I can see no reason for the suspension of Standing Orders at this time to discuss this matter. Accordingly I move: </para>

          <para>The &#39;Canberra Times&#39; had taken 9 photographs of the students meeting outside Parliament House. Two of those photographs showed Vietcong flags, both on the steps of Parliament House. The Australian&#39; took 8 photographs and not one of them showed a Vietcong flag. The Melbourne Herald&#39; took 41 photographs and not one had a picture of a Vietcong flag. The &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; refused to give me copies of its photographs. I am told by persons in that organisation with more decency in public affairs than loyalty to the organisation, that this newspaper took over 40 photographs and not one of them showed a Vietcong flag. But these 70-odd photographs taken by the NIB did at least show 1 flag. </para>
          <para>If anyone looks at the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; today he will see 2 photographs, full photographs taken by the News and Information Bureau. The newspaper has marked by a square the portion of the first photograph which the Prime Minister&#39;s </para>
          <para class="block">Press Secretary gave in a cut form to the honourable member for La Trobe. It will be noticed by anyone who looks at the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; today that not only the consequence but the purpose of cutting the photograph in that way was to destroy the perspective. Anyone looking at the full photograph would see that the Administration Building and the tops of the trees are well in view. In fact, if anyone looks right around it is quite clear that I am yards and yards - in fact scores of yards - from the Vietcong flag, that I am not looking towards it; that I am not under it; that I am not in fact speaking but that I am listening to some people on the Parliament House side of the road. If one looks at the second photograph in the Canberra Times&#39; one will see the same person speaking to me and the same people also on the other side of the road. In between these groups the lines on the road are shown. It is true that in the photograph taken with a telephoto lens and produced by the Bureau the judicious cutting by or under the Prime Minister distorted the perspective and made it appear that in some way I was associated with the Vietcong flag. It is obvious that this was not at the meeting and that I was not speaking under it. </para>

The Minister for the Interior handed me a photograph which he said was from the &#39;Canberra Times&#39;. He later asked for it back. I said I  Waited  to check it.

It is not the Minister&#39;s, as an individual, nor mine, as an individual; it is a document of the House.

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave - On 26th January 1972 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> announced that in keeping with the Government&#39;s policy of modernising Australian defence, Cabinet had approved extensive changes in the command and organisational structure of the Australian Army to provide for defence tasks which could arise in the 1970s and 1980s. He gave a broad outline of the changes to be made and emphasised that the reorganised Army would be better prepared to carry out its role in the defence of Australia and its Territories, as well as making more efficient use of manpower and funds available to the Army. As it is now some 4 months since the announcement of these changes, it is appropriate, I believe, for me to give to the Parliament a report of the progress made in the reorganisation of the Army. The changes, which are far-reaching, will take between 3 and 5 years to introduce in 3 broad areas. A Commonwealthwide functional system of command will replace the present geographical system in which military responsibilities are divided in accordance with State boundaries. There will be a rationalisation of logistic functions in which the entire logistic system is being restructured along functional lines and the principal logistic tasks of transport, supply and repair are being centred in 3 major corps groups instead of 7 as at present; and there will be a reorganisation of Army Headquarters along functional lines in keeping with other changes made throughout the Army. The first step has been an interim reorganisation of Army Headquarters. This is to be followed by the rationalisation of logistic functions, then the introduction of the functional system of command and lastly, the final reorganisation of Army Headquarters. In making this report I will deal with each step in turn, mentioning what is planned before outlining the progress made. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The interim reorganisation of Army Headquarters involved a restructuring of the 4 main military branches, the provision of improved means for high level coordination and a re-allotment of responsibilities within the branches of the Headquarters. These changes were pre-requisites for the subsequent stages of the reorganisation. This interim reorganisation of Army Headquarters is complete in all major areas. The 4 main military branches have been or are in the process of being reorganised and have been given the more functional titles of Operations, Personnel, Logistic and Materiel Branches. The  Deputy  Chief of the General Staff has become the Chief of Operations, the Adjutant-General has been renamed the Chief of Personnel, the Quartermaster General has become the Chief of Logistics and the Master General of the Ordnance, the Chief of Materiel. The titles for the branches and branch heads were adopted because they fully reflect the new functional responsibilities and are much more readily understood outside Army circles. The titles Chief of the General Staff, Vice Chief of the General Staff and Citizen Military Forces Member remain. </para>
          <para>The proposed rationalisation of logistic functions involves a re-alignment of logistic responsibilities, the disbanding of one logistic corps and the raising of another, within the overall reorganisation of the logistic system of the Army. This is an area of extraordinary complexity and has involved detailed analysis by many specialist working groups. Most of the main studies have been completed but much more meticulous and detailed work must be done before the new system becomes operative. Inter-corps transfers of personnel will be necessary but these transfers will seldom involve changes in station of members or their families. A major factor in the reorganisation has been to minimise turbulence and its disruptive effect on members and their dependants. Under the new logistic proposals, the Royal Australian Army Service Corps will be disbanded and responsibility for the complete transport function will be taken over by the new Corps of Transport on which  Her  Majesty the Queen has graciously conferred the prefix &#39;Royal&#39;. The new Corps will be known as The Royal Australian Corps of Transport and, for those specifically interested, abbreviated RACT. The supply function of the old </para>
          <para class="block">Royal Australian Army Service Corps will pass to the Royal Australian Army Ordinance Corps which will also accept responsibility for providing engineer, medical and dental stores on the advice of the appropriate professional expert. The Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will be expanded to accept repair functions at present performed by the Royal Australian Engineers and the Royal Australian Corps of Sigials. The rationalisation I have outlined should result in more effective management of transport, supply and repair resources of the Army. Most importantly, when the reorganisation is complete there should be economies in manpower in these areas. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the proposed functional system of command. The field force and logistics elements of the Army as well as training establishments will be grouped into 3 functional commands - Field Force Command, Logistic Command and Training Command. Field Force Command will consist of Regular Army field units in Australia and, initially all the Citizen Military Forces. Later, when the new system has been fully developed, Citizen Military Forces units will take their place m Logistic Command and Training Command&#39;. Logistic Command will have the overall responsibility for the logistic support of the Australian Army and will comprise all depots, base installations and logistic units within the Australian Support Area. Finally, Headquarters Training Command will be responsible for the conduct of individual training at Army training establishments and for the development of training doctrine under policy guidance of Army Headquarters. It will command some 30- odd Army schools, training battalions and training centres which, in the past, have been commanded directly by Army Headquarters, involving it in much detail. As a result of establishing these 3 functional commands the present State command headquarters will be disbanded and State and other residual matters such as works and housing, the acquisition and disposal of property, recruiting, civil emergency and general community activities, which must be performed on a geographic basis, will become the responsibility of small military district headquarters created in each State. These military district headquarters will maintain - I stress this - the close links between the </para>
          <para class="block">Army and State governments which have always existed in the past and which must essentially be maintained. The structure of Field Force Command and the organisation of its headquarters, to be located in New South Wales, is currently being examined. This study extends throughout Australia because there will be elements of the Field Force in all States. A separate complementary study is being undertaken in Queensland to determine the rearrangements necessary for the Army structure in that State including the formation of a divisional headquarters in Brisbane. A further study is being undertaken in South Australia of the implications of the functional reorganisation in that State and it is hoped that the results of this study will have application in Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The formation of a Logistic Command has no precedent in the Australian Army. This entirely new concept requires detailed development so that the Army as a whole understands how this new Command will work. Army Headquarters is well advanced in examining the organisation of Logistic Command Headquarters and the system for the command and control of logistic units. The present Headquarters 1st Division in Sydney is to become Headquarters Training Command. In anticipation of its future role it has assumed command of all Army schools and training units and many of the responsibilities for individual training. In this case the reorganisation has in fact proceeded through the study stage to limited implementation. The headquarters is to be renamed Headquarters Training Command but, because of the interlocking nature of the reorganisation, this will not take place until such time as the other commands are raised. Subject to any contingencies which may arise, it is estimated that Training Command and Field Force Command will be raised towards the end of 1973 followed by Logistic Command in 1974. </para>
          <para>When the 3 functional commands have been raised, the way is then clear for the 4 military branch organisations at Army Headquarters to be reduced to 3 branches concerned with Operations, Personnel and Logistics, provided provision is made for strong co-ordination and central management. I mention these studies and achievements to show the House that since Cabinet gave its approval, the Army is pursuing vigorously the attainment of its new organisation. At the same time, there can be no reduction in training standards and operational readiness. Moreover, the alteration of the command structure makes necessary the lengthy task of rewriting procedural instructions and revising regulations and orders. I should mention also that Papua New Guinea and our Army units in Singapore will not be affected directly by the reorganisation. They are to remain under the direct control of Army Headquarters, and will experience only indirect and consequential effects of the reorganisation on the Australian mainland. </para>
          <para>Throughout this progress report I have referred only to the Australian Army. Along with the Army reorganisation, there is a need to provide a civilian departmental structure which will match the new functional Army concept and provide for both maximum delegation and departmental representation so that there is positive participation in Army policy development. The civilian departmental structure has been subjected to a detailed examination to determine the modifications necessary. These studies are now largely complete and it is expected that appropriate re-organisational proposals will shortly be submitted to the Public Service Board. </para>
          <para>The reorganisation will bring the Army more in line with the functional organisation of the other Services. For example by raising Headquarters Field Force Command with Australia-wide responsibilities and locating it in Sydney, it is close to the equivalent headquarters of the other Services, Headquarters Flag Officer Commanding the Australian Fleet and Headquarters RAAF Operational Command. In Melbourne there will be close relationship between Headquarters Logistic Command and Headquarters RAAF Support Command. </para>
          <para>In making this report I have endeavoured to indicate, in rather more detail than has perhaps been mentioned previously, the scope of the proposed changes and the quite considerable progress that has already been made in their implementation since the Prime Minister announced the Government&#39;s approval last January. I assure the House that the task will be completed as soon as possible, commensurate with maintaining the morale and efficiency of the Service, and as the reorganisation develops I will from time to time report to this House and the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> has made a fairly lengthy statement on the implementation of the Hassett Report which recommended sweeping structural changes in the organisation of the Australian Army. It is difficult to assess the content of what the Minister has told the House without reference to the principal document, that is the Hassett Committee&#39;s report. For some absurd reason this report has not been tabled to the House nor has it been made available on a confidential basis to members of this House interested in defence topics. This makes it almost impossible to make any sort of rational comment on what the Minister has said. To a very large extent this statement is directed to the few people fortunate enough to read the report. That is, it is directed to the Department of Defence and senior officers of the Army and the Department of the Army. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There seems a lack of willingness on the part of the Government to recognise that this House is quite capable of dealing with complex military matters. This ignores the fact that a select committee of this Parliament has just spent 2 years grappling with one of the most complex military matters known to man, that is the Australian Defence Forces Retirements Benefits Fund. In light of their efforts on this question, it is ridiculous to suggest that honourable members such as the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> have not the nous to assess the reorganisation of the Australian Army in view of their contribution to the DFRB report. Far too many of these military reports are never released, supposedly for irrelevant security reasons. The most notable is the Morshead report on the reorganisation of the defence departments which was made  in  1958 and never made public. Very soon it will be covered by the conditions for the release of historical documents. Other inquiries of a similar nature which have been completed and not disclosed are the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the integration of the Armed Forces, the study of army establishments post-Vietnam and the study of the armed forces of Papua New Guinea. </para>
          <para>It is very difficult to conduct any sort of an informed defence debate in the absence of detailed information. On the specific topic dealt with by the Minister it seems that satisfactory progress is being made in the rationalisation of the army structure. It seems that the recommendations of the Hassett Committee are being introduced very cautiously. For the reasons I have stressed, it is difficult to quibble with this. Certainly the old organisation based on State commands was antiquated and outmoded. In essentials it was much the same as the organisation which took Australian forces through the Boer War. It was illogical that the Ah&#34; Force and the Navy could develop flexible and functional commands while the Army persisted with the old imperial structure. The sweeping away of this obsolete structure was long overdue. </para>
          <para>There are some curious aspects of the statement made by the Minister. It is difficult to comprehend how a functional organisation can be achieved without considerable movement of personnel. It is implied in the statement that there will be few movements from State to State. In effect the number of personnel in each State will remain substantially the same yet there is to be a rationalisation on functional lines. One would have thought that the essence of a functional organisation was concentration of personnel in a few key areas. This is certainly the case in other military services. </para>
          <para>It is equally true that the Minister does not agree with some of the points I am putting in relation to this matter. I would be very happy, as I know the honourable member for La Trobe would be - and I exclude the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> who, of course, is not interested in these subjects - to have a full scale debate on this question. There are members on the other side of the House as well as on this side of the House who would welcome such a debate. I say to the Minister that he has deliberately introduced into this House in the dying stages of this Parliament a very important statement in relation to reorganisation merely because he wanted to be able to make his first statement to the nation as the Minister for the Army. </para>
          <para>This is a very important subject. I want the Minister to tell the House why honourable members who are interested in these matters are not given the opportunity, for example, to debate the Hassett report. Obviously this report contains very valuable recommendations. The Minister has referred to it but it is not available to those honourable members who take an interest in this subject. </para>
          <para>I have just referred to the ridiculous situation that has persisted in this Parliament since 1958 regarding the Morshead Report. This very valuable document has never been released to those who take an interest in the defence of this country and who want to be informed on these matters. I believe it is time that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn),</inline> who has some responsibility in these matters, informed the Parliament why so many of the reports which are made by many committees of inquiry set up by this Parliament, the Department of Defence or the Minister for Defence, whichever one one may wish to choose, and which deliberate and consider recommendations that ought to be made to bring Australia&#39;s defence structure into line with some of the more advanced countries overseas, are not presented to the Parliament. For some unknown reason, as in the case of the Morshead Report, this latest report is used extensively by the Minister to make his first statement in this House but is not available to those who give urgent consideration to this subject and who believe that they are entitled to be informed on recommendations which affect the whole structure of the defence forces in Australia. </para>
          <para>In the absence of the Hassett report there is some reason for scepticism about how fundamental this reorganisation is. Another absence from the Minister&#39;s statement is any reference to economies which a rationalisation would normally be expected to produce. There is not the slightest hint that the new structure will mean economies in the very large part of Army spending which is now going to administration. It is implicit that the new organisation will cost just as much and absorb just as many men in administrative duties as the old structure. This is unfortunate because the whole concept of rationalisation is to make savings, both in manpower and money. It is of crucial importance that all of the defence services find ways of diverting resources away from the long administrative tail and getting them to the areas such as weapons replacement where funds are badly needed. With the Army in particular scratching for manpower and the Government insisting that it can not make do with one man fewer than 40,000 it is a pity that the reorganisation should not have freed many more men from administration to service in training, specialist and combat roles. </para>
          <para>Another aspect of army administration largely ignored by the Minister is the future of the Citizen Military Forces. He made a short reference to it in his statement. It is a very important matter for consideration by this Parliament. Late last year the former Minister for the Army made a comprehensive statement on the future of the CMF and outlined a number of excellent suggestions for reform and improvement. When the Hassett Committee reorganisation was announced there were claims that its provisions would have a very serious impact on the CMF. It was even said that the new organisation would sound the death knell of the CMF. We have had no enlightenment on this subject from the Minister. </para>
          <para>Certainly it is difficult to reconcile the programme announced by the former Minister with the implications of the Hassett Committee report and today&#39;s statement by the Minister. If the new functional organisation has had a serious impact on the CMF then the Minister has a duty to spell this out to the House and outline what the Army proposes to do to cushion the impact on the CMF of these structural changes. The Minister did make one interesting point towards the end of his statement when he indicated the closer relationship the changes would bring to the commands of the 3 Services. He referred to the much closer liaison the new structure would bring with the Australian fleet and the Royal Australian Air Force. The Minister is correct in stressing this as a notable advance. It is to be hoped that the 3 Services can be brought even closer with a reorganisation of the cumbersome defence administration structure at </para>
          <para class="block">Russell Hill. In conclusion, I hope it is possible for the House during the Budget session to debate the issues raised by the Minister at greater length and with the greater knowledge provided by access to the Hassett report. </para>

              <para>- I agree in general with what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> has said. It is very difficult for members of this House who take an interest, as far as they can, in defence matters when a report is suddenly presented to the Parliament. I certainly had no notice of it. I have not seen the Hassett report. I do not know the basis for the statement made by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> and therefore I presume that I am expected to accept it at face value. The matters raised by the Minister seem reasonably sound, with some small exceptions. I have in mind that many of the phrases which are now used as the great thoughts of the present, such as the military district system have been in operation before. 1 have lived through the lines of communication&#39; system and &#39;everything is always for the best&#39; and &#39;everything is always up to date&#39;. </para>

          <para>But what I have in mind is the occasion when I heard another Minister for Defence say in this House that the most modern organisational system had been implemented for the Australian Army, which was the pentropic division. With a considerable amount of opposition from the Ministers, together with various persons who were interested in Army organisation we eventually managed to have the pentropic division thrown out. It was sold to this House and sold to the defence system but it proved to be thoroughly inadequate and unworkable. It was one of the most disruptive features in which the Army ever became involved. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that honourable members should see the Hassett report and should eventually be able to debate the reorganisation of the Army because I think it is most essential that we do not once again become involved - I am not suggesting that we are involved - in something on which we have had little say and of which we have little knowledge. </para>

            <para>- The one hundred and thirty-fifth and one hundred and thirty-sixth reports relate to Treasury minutes arising from previous reports of the Committee tabled in the Parliament. The one hundred and thirty-seventh report relates to the report of the Auditor-General for the financial year 1970-71. The Committee would again congratulate the Auditor-General and his staff for the sustained effort they have made over many years to present the report to Parliament during August. As we have indicated on previous occasions, the tabling of the report during that month each year has assisted the Committee considerably in this important area of its work. In its inquiry into that report the Committee took evidence from the Department of the Army, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Northern Territory Administration of the Department of the Interior, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the Department of Supply and the Department of Works. In all, our inquiry related to 9 matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In the case of the Department of the Army we inquired into a loss occasioned by fire that occurred at the workshop building at Puckapunyal on 16th December 1970. This proved to be the third such inquiry conducted by the Committee since 1967-68 involving major fire disasters in temporary buildings. In view of the fires on which we have reported previously and the circumstances disclosed in the present case, we believe that a survey should be made of all temporary war-time and like buildings currently ownd by the Commonwealth so that further consideration can be given to their replacement by permanent structures. The Committee believes that this is particularly important having regard to the fact that, in accordance with Treasury directions, the Commonwealth acts as its own insurer, to the greatest extent possible, for all property under its control. </para>
        <para>Also in connection with the Department of the Army, the Committee inquired into the purchase of prime-movers and semitrailers. The evidence shows that there were 3 significant weaknesses connected with the contract and its subsequent administration. While the Department of the Army has designed appropriate guidelines to ensure against a recurrence of these weaknesses, the Committee believes that the principles involved should be examined carefully by other Departments engaged in procurement activities. </para>
        <para>In relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs the Committee inquired into financial and related matters at the overseas posts. While the Committee recognises that in recent years the Department has experienced a rapid expansion of commitments in relation to its resources and has implemented a number of initiatives for administrative improvement, it is nevertheless disappointed to find that the Department has not yet made a more effective impact on the administrative problems confronting it. It appears that major problems exist in the areas of staff recruitment; training; the inspection of overseas posts; internal audit work in relation to these posts; the re-issue of departmental overseas accounting instructions and the system of arranging the overseas posting of staff. Doubts also exist as to whether, in some cases, heads of missions overseas are able to supervise effectively the administration of their posts, having regard to the range of their responsibilities. While it appears that action which has been taken recently by the Department of the Treasury will provide some assistance to the Department of Foreign Affairs in connection with its overseas posts, it is clear that the problems within these posts must be resolved by the Department of Foreign Affairs itself. </para>
        <para>The evidence taken from the Department of the Interior related to defalcations that had occurred at the Alice Springs office of the Northern Territory Administration. It appears that the defalcations arose from failure to implement the Administration&#39;s manual of administrative instructions. It also appears, however, that there is a need for that manual to be examined critically and its defects rectified. The evidence also shows that there is a strong need for the improvement of staff training at the Alice Springs office. </para>
        <para>In the case of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the Committee&#39;s inquiry related to the need to provide for an effective check of revenue arising from the licensing of broadcast and television receivers on hire. In view of the importance that the Committee attaches to the adequate protection of Commonwealth revenue, we trust that an early effective solution will be found to the problems confronting the Department in relation to these licences. </para>
        <para>In the case of the Department of Supply, our inquiry was directed to the matter of waste paper disposal in automatic data processing areas. The evidence shows that there has been a lack of uniformity in the treatment of sales of this waste. When our inquiry occurred last February, however, action had been taken by the Department of the Treasury to bring the disposal of all waste paper under effective administrative control. </para>
        <para>In relation to the Department of Works, the Committee&#39;s inquiry related to recoverable administrative charges; the construction of an incinerator at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and precautions against fire damage in computer installations. In the case of recoverable administrative charges, it appears that appropriate action is in hand to review the administrative on-costs applied by the Department in respect of work carried out for certain of its client organisations. In the case of the incinerator constructed at the Kingsford Smith Airport, it appears that while many of the causes of difficulty experienced by the departments concerned were beyond their control, a more thorough analysis of the materia&#93; to be destroyed should have been made before the incinerator designs were developed. In relation to precautions against fire damage in computer installations, it appears that there has been some laxity in the promulgation of written instructions as to the methods of using fire fighting equipment in and around automatic data processing installations and in the standing arrangements for the protection of master magnetic tapes and similar records. The Committee would emphasise that it regards deficiencies of this nature in administrative arrangements in a serious light. However, it appears that action is in hand in the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Works and the Commonwealth Fire Board with a view to rectifying the weaknesses disclosed. </para>
        <para>Three of the matters covered in this inquiry arose from special audit investigations that were carried out by the Auditor-General&#39;s Office. The Committee would commend the Auditor-General on his initiative in conducting reviews of this nature. Apart from their directly beneficial results they also contribute materially to the effective operations of this Committee. I commend the reports to honourable members. </para>

            <para>- I should like briefly to say how pleased I am that this proposed work has come before the Parliament. We all know that the plans have been in the making for some years and that they have been altered again and again. Finally, the Public Works Committee have come up with the scheme now before the House. I would like to point out that in this revised plan, instead of having a great percentage of institutionalised accommodation for nurses, there has been included a bed sitter complex of 50 or 60 units. I know that the staff have been requesting this type of accommodation for some considerable time and this will be very gratifying to them. I hope that the provision of these units will in some way assist the recruitment of nursing staff for the Alice Springs hospital. Another notable addition to the plans for the new hospital is the swimming pool. At the moment, whenever the nurses feel inclined for a swim which, during the summer is every day, they must walk some distance from their quarters across the main highway into the town and avail themselves of the good offices of the owner of a motel which has a swimming pool. This is a notable addition and I am very pleased to see that it has been included in the plans. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also note from the report that completion is expected to meet the target date set down. As I said, the rebuilding of the Alice Springs hospital has been on the stocks for quite some time and it is long overdue for consideration. In fact, I think it probably will be filled as soon as it is completed. I hope that the plan includes some provision whereby there can be a fairly ready construction of additional accommodation because the Alice Springs hospital serves an area of hundreds of thousands of square miles - virtually from Oodnadatta in the south to Tennant Creek in the north and from the Queensland border to Western Australia. In the past, this hospital has been overcrowded, especially in the children&#39;s ward and it serves as a base hospital for the area. The $13m odd will be money very well spent. I urge the Department of Works and the people who are planning the hospital to get on with the designs as soon as possible. </para>

In fact, I would think that the midwifery section is as good as could be found anywhere, and I hops that it will be used in some way or another. </para>

          <para>The Hospital Advisory Board has spent many hours of meetings trying to achieve the right design and has received the opinions of people who will be using the hospital. Finally the plans have come to fruition. The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> remarked that honourable members were not informed prior to its introduction that this matter was to be brought before the House. I would agree that probably he has been disadvantaged although he is a member of the Public Works Committee and so, I should think, he would have little reason to complain about the matter. I commend the Government. </para>

            <para>- The Bill before the House at the moment is a minor Bill to extend the life of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act from 30th June 1972 until 30th June 1973. The Opposition supports the legislation because, like the government, we are of the opinion that the time is not yet opportune to introduce permanent legislation affecting the waterfront, which as yet has not settled down following the revolutionary change in stevedoring brought about by the introduction of containers, roll-on roll-off ships, palletising and the other innovations which have been introduced into the stevedoring industry. I know that the trade unions involved also are not anxious at this stage to have permanent legislation introduced. The stevedoring industry also is not yet ready for a permanent Act. Therefore, everyone is completely in agreement with what is taking place, namely the extension of the temporary provisions for another 12 months. Let us hope that in that time the industry will be ready for permanent legislation so that everyone can get on with the job. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One thing which does concern me are the statements that have been made by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> I do not think the Minister has contributed to settling down the various parties in the industry. The Minister has in front of him, as I have, his statement of 18th April. One of the statements which concerns me is contained in the last paragraph where the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Several aspects of the Agreement involve Government legislation. The Government will examine the implications of the Agreement but will certainly not be committed to any amendment of the legislation simply because of an agreement which has been negotiated without its endorsement. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Where does the Government stand on this question? Does it favour people in an industry negotiating agreements and so bring about an understanding between employer and employee within the industry or does it favour heavy handed action by the Arbitration Commission or conciliation commissioners in bringing down decisions that are mandatory on both parties, irrespective of whether the decisions are acceptable to both parties? </para>
          <para>In recent weeks we have debated a very controversial amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In another place the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is being debated at length and that debate could well result in this House being reconvened to deal with business referred to it by the other place. So it is obvious that the more satisfactory method of settling industrial disputes is by negotiation around the table between employer and employee. Let us look at the decisions which have been reached and examine a piece of legislation that was previously introduced into this House and which lay on the notice paper for some time. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> very strongly criticises the recent agreement made at a round-table conference between waterfront labour and a waterfront employer. He criticises the $8 a week increase in the base rate for the first 12 months followed by an additional $4 increase in 1973. The increases represent in the first case $416 a year and in the second case an additional $208 in 12 months time. There is no guarantee that this $208 per annum increase as from May 1973 will in any way take up the increase in the cost of living to which we have been subjected over recent years. </para>
          <para>We should compare those increases with, for example, recommendations made by the Government involving the salaries of certain people such as the  chairman  of the Australian Commission on Advanced Education. In that case there is a recommendation that the figure $18,973 be omitted and the figure $22,012 inserted in its place. That is not a bad sort of increase. When one looks at the other increases which are contained in this Bill one asks why the Government is complaining about workers in an industry obtaining an increase of $416 a year to be followed by an increase of $208 a year. The Government applies two standards. It applies one standard to certain classes of people and another standard to others on a lower rung. One of the ridiculous aspects of arbitration today is the flow-on. For example, a fitter goes to court and establishes an entitlement to, say, $7 a week increase in his margin or in his wages, but by the time the flow-on finishes the tall poppies get about $4,000 increase out of it. To me this is not fair and reasonable. I do not think we should apply percentage increases granted to people on a low rate of income to people on a higher rate. I understand the problems associated with relativity, but at the same time the problems of the low income groups have to be taken into consideration. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order!</inline>The detailed comments which the honourable member is making would be better left until the appropriate legislation comes before the House. The honourable member for Newcastle was justified in mentioning certain factors in general terms because they were mentioned in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech, but detailed comments in relation to those matters should be left until the appropriate legislation comes before the House. This legislation provides mainly for the extension of something for a very limited period of time. </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting . I was talking about the difference in the increases in wages of people in certain brackets of income, involving some $3,000 and $4,000 a year and the amount of increase in the recent negotiated agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers of waterfront labour, involving, in the first year, an increase of $416 per annum and, in the second year, an increase of $208 per annum. I drew attention to the inequalities that existed and I do not propose to touch on this aspect again. I now draw attention to the movement in cargo and the movement in the labour force on the waterfront throughout Australia and the improvement that has taken place in tonnage rates. I meant to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> whether he would agree to the incorporation in Hansard of a table that I have prepared which sets out the movement in the labour force since 1955, the daily employed average in 1955 as against 1969 to 1971, cargo throughput and other figures. The figures were not taken out by the Parliamentary Library Research Section; I took them out myself. I seek leave to have the table incorporated. </para>

              <para>- I thank the House. The table shows that since 1955 there has been a decline in the labour force on the waterfront from 23,400 men in 1955 to 16,500 men in 1969  -  in the days of the introduction of container shippingand to 15,050 in 1971. All told, from 1959 to 1971, there has been a reduction of 36 per cent in the actual labour force. In 1955 the daily average number of men employed was 18,800, and this has now dropped to 10,700  -  a decline of 43 per cent. Cargo throughput has increased from 24,900,000 tons to 46,600,000 tons - an increase of 87 per cent. There has been a reduction of 43 per cent in the actual number of men employed daily. The men who have been retained are now handling an additional 87 per cent of cargo. So there is a big imbalance between the number of men employed and the throughput of cargo, which has been increased substantially. On the basis of the number of tons of cargo handled per man, it works out in 1955 at an average of 1,300 tons per man per annum. In 1971 it had increased to 4,700 tons per man per annum or an increase of 262 per cent. </para>

              <para>-Order! I was not in the House before the suspension of the sitting. As I see it, this Bill is very simple. It provides merely for the extension of temporary provisions. I know that the second reading speech of the Minister expressed some concern regarding working hours and so forth. But the main purpose of the Bill is to extend the temporary scheme. It does not open up for debate all the provisions in the principal Act. </para>

              <para>- I have finished with the figures I was just quoting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I have made my point on them and I thank you for drawing my attention to the limitations of the Bill. I turn now to the question of redundancy. Since 1967 in the stevedoring industry there have been 1,248 voluntary redundancies and 70 compulsory retirements - a total of 1,318. The severance pay that has been paid under the regulations and the supplementary payments made by employers to old and unfit men who have been required to retire, represents a total payment of some $3,588,000. The questions that are worrying people are: What is to happen? How much longer will this redundancy continue and how many more men will be displaced? </para>

          <para class="block">At the moment there is no clear picture of what is the real situation. These things must be resolved before permanent legislation is introduced. Recently I have received correspondence from the union representative of the Federated Clerks Union members employed by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority indicating that these employees are vitally concerned with permanency and redundancy on the waterfront, and just where they fit into the provisions of the Bill. As permanency develops, as more men are employed and as more waterfront labour is employed by permanent employers, the need for these men to be retained becomes less. I hope that in his reply the Minister will give some constructive ideas about what the Government proposes to do with the men employed at present by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and indicate their position as far as staff redundancy is concerned. This matter is causing these men great concern and they want to know what is their position. I hope that the Government will come up with some answers to the overall effects of containerisation, roll-on roll-off ships and the other revolutionary changes that have taken place on the waterfront and also will indicate what it proposes to do about the ports that are more vitally affected. Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle are reasonably well catered for although there has been some redundancy even in those ports which are the principal container ports of the Commonwealth. But all of the outer ports are affected by redundancy. As a result of the new trends in shipping I have seen a substantial and major contraction of waterfront labour at the port of Newcastle which is in my electorate. Twenty years ago 1,500 to 1,600 men were employed there on coal loading and on general cargo loading. The amount of coal that is being handled in exports through the port has more than doubled during the last 5 years since the construction of a 2,000-ton an hour coal loader. This, together with other innovations that were introduced into the port, has resulted in the number of men engaged on coal loading being reduced from 700 to something like a maximum of 15 to 20 men today. This is one of the problems to which the Government has to find a solution. You just do not get rid of so many men overnight. The port quota in </para>
          <para class="block">Newcastle in 1970 was 600 and as from last Sunday night it has been reduced from 404 to 372. This trend does not look like stopping. For example, one of the major cargoes handled through the port of Newcastle was wool. In 1963-64 309,019 bales of wool were shipped through the port. In 1970-71 the figure had declined to 62,265 bales of wool, and this year it is expected that the total number of bales shipped through the port will have declined to less than 40,000. This just cannot be allowed to happen. The Government cannot allow the economy of the port of Newcastle or that district to decline. It has to come up with answers. This does not apply only to the port of Newcastle; it applies to every port throughout the Commonwealth, with the possible exception of Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle. All other ports are vitally affected by the substantial change that has taken place in the handling of cargoes throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>These men are entitled to some suitable compensation. The redundancy payment may appear to be very large, but where does a man of 55 years of age, with no particular training other than as a waterside worker, obtain other employment. He is a skilled employee in his own field, but when he is taken out of it he is just another fellow, and he has commitments based on an income of $90 to $100 a week. He then finds that the only employment available to him is as a labourer, and he has to meet his commitments out of a wage of approximately $45 to a maximum of $55 a week. The change is too great, and men should not be required to carry the burden of this change. Therefore, the Government should be coming up with answers to these problems, and the Minister should have some answers. </para>
          <para>Not only are the men in the industry to be taken into consideration; the whole district has to be considered: I have quoted the figures on the amount of wool shipped through the port of Newcastle in my electorate. I can give similar figures for other commodities. I quoted the figures for wool because that was one of the major exports on the general cargo side. I do not intend to deal with coal, iron ore, limestone and other things. But on the general cargo side at one time there used to be plenty of ships coming through the port of Newcastle. </para>
          <para class="block">The number of ships coming through the port now has declined to almost half the number that came through the port 10 years ago. As ships do not come to the port of Newcastle to pick up wool, they are not coming to Newcastle to pick up the other cargo that should normally be handled through the port. The result is that long established industries in that district today are folding up and moving to Sydney or some other city and reopening, in many cases they have completely closed down. This has been brought about because of the change that has taken place in the shipping industry. Up to date the Government has had no answers to these problems. </para>

For these reasons we support the proposition to extend the operation of the Act from 30th June 1972 until 30th June 1973. I hope that in the intervening period the Minister and his Department will be able to bring up some constructive suggestions as to what can be done to assist the men who will be displaced, or who have been displaced in these ports, and the economies of those cities which have been disrupted because of the change In shipping. You just cannot make a change overnight and expect people to carry the result of decisions which are made by a minority of the people. </para>

            <para>- I understood that the Government had another  speaker,  besides the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> to speak in this debate. Because that  speaker  is not in the chamber at the moment, one could perhaps question whether he will follow what will be 2 speakers from the Opposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I support the remarks of the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> who expressed the view that we were not opposed to the Bill. I rise because of the fact that the second reading speech made by the Minister was much more extensive than I thought it would have been, in view of the restrictive nature of the Bill that is now before the House. I noted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that on one occasion you saw fit to draw the attention of the honourable member for Newcastle to the fact that he was moving outside the Bill in canvassing these matters in the debate. I was also pleased, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that you did allow some latitude to that honourable member, and I would hope that you would allow me similar latitude in order to permit at least reasonable debate on this measure. </para>
          <para>I think that at this point in time the Bill itself does nothing much more than to extend, for a further 12 months the provisions contained in the Bill which was passed by this chamber last year. But it is interesting to note that there has been some criticism by the Minister of the current situation on the waterfront relative to a number of matters in the maritime industry. The Minister saw fit to criticise the type of industrial agreement that has just been negotiated and has been overwhelmingly endorsed by a democratic vote of the whole of the membership of the Waterside Workers Federation. He has been critical of the fact that the industry has been able to get together and perhaps solve its own domestic problems insofar as its wage structure is concerned and, indeed, beyond that, in a very wide area of the conditions on the waterfront, none of which is less important than the question of redundancy. </para>
          <para>I am sure that the Minister will agree that since 1965 the industry itself has virtually moved away from being a labour intensive industry to one which, at this point of time could be described as a mechanised intensive industry. In support of that one would need to go no further than to refer to the total membership of the Federation. From 1963, when the first of the unit vessels started to arrive on the coast, if my memory serves me correctly, until this point of time the membership of the Federation dropped from 26,000 odd to 16,000. I would think that would be a more accurate figure today. We had ports that carried approximately 2,500 men in a labour intensive field which had a nonmechanised structure for the loading and unloading of vessels. The number of men employed in these ports today has dropped to 900. </para>
          <para>I think the Minister in his second reading speech expressed some disappointment about industrial disputes within the industry. I think he has failed to appreciate that with such a very large percentage of the labour force lost to the industry because of mechanisation there has not been as much disputation around this as perhaps one could have expected in an industry such as the one covered by the Bill with which we are dealing at the present time. The Minister in his position should realise when mechanisation started to have its effect on the waterfront there were a number of matters peculiar to the industry. There was an extremely high average age among the men engaged in the industry, and this meant that the men who were closest to retiring age and were considered to be redundant, found it extremely difficult to be trained in some other occupation. In addition there was the fact that the Act itself stated that the last men who joined the industry should be the first to go. So the Government deprived the industry of the younger, fit men and retained those who had had a lifetime in a very hazardous and arduous industry to carry on the burden of work. </para>
          <para>The Government should not complain about the decisions reached at various conferences since  1965  relative to this industry because I suppose it could be laid on the doorstep of the Government that the whole conference system commenced as a result of legislation that unfortunately was passed through this House in  1965.  The Minister has made some reference to that inasmuch as he referred to the  chairman  of the conference as being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> E. Woodward, Q.C. As I said before, viewed against the background of the immense problems associated with the industry in relation to a whole number of factors which no doubt will continue in the future, I do not think we should at this point of time be too critical of the fact that perhaps this system has not come up to all expectations. Many revolutionary methods in the handling of cargo which no doubt will come on to the Australian waterfront within the next few years were not thought of when the original conferences began. I refer to PAD vessels and so on. There are ships today that are capable of being loaded and unloaded without the use of manual effort, other than that which is required for the purpose of directing, driving and handling mechanical equipment generally. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that the Government still has a responsibility in this area and that it has not met that responsibility to an extent where it would effect improved industrial relations. I refer there to a proper concept of what industrial relations ought to be. Some matters have not been resolved by recent conferences, as the Minister would know. The Minister and his Government have adopted an attitude which has led almost to direct industrial disputation, not because of the attitude between the parties within the industry on the basis of employer and employee but rather because of the attitude projected by the Government which was disappointed to find that industrial peace might perhaps prevail on the waterfront area generally. The criticism of the negotiations at a vital time by the Minister and by supporters of the Government in this place certainly did not add to the collective arrangements and bargaining that was going on at various employer and employee levels. The Minister has completely overlooked the fact that from the inception of the conference system - there is mention of this in the second reading speech and the Bill makes provision for this- </para>

              <para>- I must have inadvertently said &#39;not&#39; because the fact is that there is something in the Bill to which I am now going to refer. The Government should realise and recognise the fact that it has been, directly or indirectly - whichever way the Minister likes to read it - involved in a form of direct negotiation and in a form of collective bargaining of which the Minister has been so critical in the past. The Government has at least had its agents there in two ways - through the Department of Labour and National <inline font-style="italic">Service,</inline> for which Department the Minister has responsibility, and also through the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. </para>

          <para>If the Minister is critical and continues to be critical of what has happened in the past, I urge him to inform the House whether his Department is prepared on behalf of the industry and after proper and understood discussions with those in the industry, be they employer or employee, to recognise that the problems have not gone and that the intense mechanisation will continue.  His  Department ought to be prepared to discuss these measures on a proper understanding of industrial relations for the benefit of the industry, of transport generally and in the public interest, to which he has made some brief reference. I urge the Minister to realise that all the problems in any industry are not loaded on one particular side, but are a responsibility of both sides. </para>
          <para>It has been said by the industry that the gains made by or benefits given to the industry in the last few weeks as a result of some months of discussions are not in themselves going to cause any freight rate increase, although a newspaper report this morning was somewhat to the contrary. I remind the Minister when he is dealing with this area that, for a number of years when there was no wage movement whatsoever in the industry, the percentage cost of freight was the highest it had ever been and, indeed, was much higher than when there were wage increases within the industry. Like my colleague the honourable member for Newcastle, I do not oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply - This Bill, as I mentioned in my second reading speech, is comparatively simple in terms of purpose. The Bill proposes, as honourable members on both sides of the House appreciate, to extend the operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-1971 for a further period of 12 months. The House recognises that the present Act expires on 30th June 1972. The arrangements under which the present permanent employment scheme in the stevedoring industry operates will not be able to continue beyond that date unless the life of the Act is extended for a further period. The proposal therefore is that the operation of the Act be extended to 30th June 1973. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As this matter has been agreed on by both sides of the House it is not my purpose at this stage to seek to extend the nature of the debate, except to refer in passing to some of the points to which honourable members opposite have drawn attention. The honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> referred in detail to a Press statement which I issued on 18th April 1972 concerning an agreement recently negotiated between the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and employers of waterside labour. To save the time of the House by reading the statement or summarising it I ask for leave of the House to incorporate it in Hansard. </para>

            <para>CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT FOR WATERSIDE WORKERS</para>
            <para class="block">Statement by the Minister  for  Labour  and  National Service, The Honourable Phillip Lynch, M.P. </para>
            <para>Yesterday, the WWF and employer representatives in the stevedoring industry, jointly announced that negotiations concerning conditions of employment for waterside workers to apply after the 5th May had been completed. </para>
            <para>I have not yet seen the full text of the proposed Agreement. However, I understand that it involves an immediate $8 per week increase in basic pay followed by a further 84 in May 1973, a reduction in standard hours of work to 35 per week, increased pensions and attendance money, and an agreement that redundancy will only be effected by voluntary means. </para>
            <para>This agreement can only, be described as one which has had no regard to the overall interests of the Australian community. The immediate increase in wages is almost 12 per cent with  a  further 6 per cent increase to follow in 12 months, while the concession of a 35 hour working week will increase the rate of overtime payment by 121 per cent. </para>
            <para>This agreement is a cynical example of the abuse of monopoly power. On the one hand the Federation has been able to exploit ils monopoly of labour in the industry with the prospect  of  direct action if its major claims were not conceded. On the other the employer!! - strongly influenced by overseas shipping interests - have been prepared to concede demands because  of  their ability to pass on costs by increasing freight rates to the detriment of Australian shippers. </para>
            <para>In all this, the Arbitration Commission has been by-passed and the inflationary spiral has been given a new twist. Taken in isolation the agreement may not have a major quantitative effect on prices and costs in Australia. But no industry or group of wage earners exists in isolation. Changes in wages and terms of employment in one industry will generally affect costs in other industries - either through &#39;flow-on&#39;, or through the effect on the costs of goods and services purchased. What is done in the stevedoring industry is no less important than what <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> done in any other industry. </para>
            <para>In the last 2 years, the Australian economy has experienced a severe bout of wage-cost inflation. The Government has sought to stem the problem by intervening frequently and vigorously, in major award hearings before the Commission. </para>
            <para>As a result of these and other measures there are now reasonable hopes of a slowing down in the rate of cost and price inflation during 1972. </para>
            <para>However, concessions in wages and conditions of the magnitude which the WWF and stevedoring employers have negotiated outside the Conciliation and Arbitration System give the inflationary spiral fresh impetus and make the Government&#39;s task in controlling it far more difficult. </para>
            <para>I understand that the agreement will contain provisions for the settlement of any disputes which arise in respect of the terms of the Agreement without stoppages taking place. While any proposal to reduce work stoppages in this industry must be welcomed there must be serious doubts as to the value of provisions which are limited in the way these appear to be. Indeed the employers appear to have conceded to the Federation the right to engage in political stoppages or stoppages called by the ACTU, a Trades and Labour Council or at the behest of any international trade union federation with which the ACTU or the Federation is affiliated. </para>
            <para>Moreover the inclusion of procedures in an agreement cannot be regarded as indicative of the parties&#39; future intention to observe them in this industry, in the light of the failure by the Federation to observe previous agreements and the unwillingness by the employers to enforce them. There is a need for a real change of attitude by both parties if what is now proposed is to have any chance of success. </para>
            <para>Two aspects of the negotiations deserve the most severe criticism. One is that in a key industry there has been a reduction in the hours of work without the full economic implications being considered by a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The manner in which this concession was negotiated gave no opportunity for other interested employer groups to express their views on the possible consequences for other industries and the economy at large. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s views have been made very clear on this and other matters. On two occasions during the course of these negotiations the employers&#39; representative body, the National Industrial Council, informed me of the progress of the negotiations. I made it abundantly clear that the Government was strongly opposed to any wage increases which would add to the cost-push inflation we have been experiencing and would be gravely concerned at any reduction in standard hours of work unless this was granted by the Commission in arbitration proceedings. From other representations made to me I know that some major operating stevedoring employers share the Government&#39;s concern. </para>
            <para>The other aspect is that many of the matters which have been the subject of negotiations impinge on the legislation relating to the industry, and the administration of that legislation by the ASIA. Notwithstanding that both parties have been repeatedly told that the proper forum to discuss such matters is the Stevedoring Industry Council they have proceeded to negotiate these matters between themselves without reference to the other parties represented on the Council. </para>
            <para>The parties in the industry are also well aware that the Stevedoring Industry Charge for permanent waterside workers was raised from 65 cents to SI per man-hour last February in order to cover the cost of items such as idle time, long service leave, annual and sick leave, pensions, and redundancy benefits which are financed through the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. It appears that the concessions made in the new agreement will place the Authority once again in a financially untenable position. </para>
            <para>Several aspects of the Agreement involve Government legislation. The Government will examine the implications of the Agreement but will certainly not be committed to any amendment of the legislation simply because of an agreement which has been negotiated without its endorsement. </para>

            <para>- The tenor of the remarks of the honourable member for Newcastle appears to be that it is right and proper for matters in the agreement to be the subject of negotiation exclusively between the parties, presumably without the benefit of the arbitration process, which the honourable gentleman referred to as &#39;heavy handed&#39;, if I recall his words correctly, and certainly without interference by the Government. This, quite clearly, is one of the major areas of difference between both sides of this House in considering the basic issues of industrial relations. The fact is that what the parties are negotiating goes far beyond the ambit of industrial awards which apply to this industry. They have sought on a bilateral basis to vary arrangements which were originally agreed to by the tripartite national stevedoring conference and which were introduced by the Government in the form of temporary legislation which we are now proposing to extend. Even if their proposed agreement had been limited to award matters only, there are of course other considerations) which are important and which require to be borne in mind. </para>

          <para>It is certainly possible for  2  parties to agree on a particular matter which may well be to the detriment of a third party <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> in fact the community itself. In other words, so far as the Government is concerned, industrial relations is not a bipartite matter, that is to say a matter exclusively for negotiation between 2 principal parties, but in fact must be viewed as tripartite. That of course, takes into account the public interest, which we believe should be safeguarded at all times. Although the honourable member made some reference to the increase in recent years towards a system of collective bargaining, I am certain that he and other members of the Opposition would be very well aware of the impact which collective bargaining wage negotiations can have on what I call the outside groups in the general community. I think here of 4 major groups: I think of the superannuitants; I think of those on fixed incomes; I think of pensioners; and I think also, having particular regard to the comments made in many other debates by my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly),</inline> of the impact which these negotiations can have on the rural sector. </para>
          <para>If these interests are to be safeguarded on the question of wage negotiations, it is fundamental that these matters ought to be considered by arbitration. In that context the Government has made this point very clear in the Press statement which I issued on 18th April. There is no doubt that some important aspects of this agreement should be given proper consideration in the public interest. In particular, the proposal to reduce standard hours in that industry is one which the Government very firmly believes should be determined by a Presidential bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and not determined by 2 parties who have no responsibility for the consequences of their action in terms of impact on the national economy. </para>
          <para>The increased wage rates contemplated can in no way be justified by any reference to work value, productivity trends or relativities with other occupations without reference to the Arbitration Commission. Although the honourable member for Newcastle has in passing been critical of the Arbitration Commission, I believe it is wise that one should remind the community of the simple fact that the workers of this country have gained immeasurably by the operation of the arbitration system over the very long period since 1904. If that system is to be put in peril because of direct negotiations, industrial unrest or unions acting in defiance of the system, in the long run the workers of this country will be the losers, and certainly those groups in the community who are disadvantaged by wage negotiations but are not party to them will continue to be disadvantaged, as 1 believe is happening at the present time. If honourable members on the other side have any doubt about this matter, they could do well to look at Lord Thomas Balogh&#39;s publication on the question of inflation. He, of course, was an adviser to the Harold Wilson Government. He is a well known Oxford economist and he makes very clearly indeed the point that direct industrial action in the United Kingdom during the period of the Wilson administration was certainly counter productive to the needs and the position of disadvantaged groups in the general community. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Newcastle queried the future role of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in relation to its staff. Of course, one appreciates very much that the staff would have a natural concern about this matter. A committee has been established to consider proposals in respect of the staff of the Authority who may become redundant if there is a further reduction in the Authority&#39;s role in the industry. The staff rules of the Authority include a proviso that staff will be given at least 6 months warning of any likely retrenchments. I believe that meets the point that the honourable gentleman raised. In relation to the question of those waterside workers who have been subject to retrenchment in recent months or who may be subject to retrenchment in the future, I remind the honourable gentleman of the availability of the Government&#39;s technological change retraining programme. Waterside workers who meet the conditions of that programme will be eligible for training within its ambit. There are many other matters that one could bring into this debate at this stage, but having regard to time I simply commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- This Bill, as its long title shows, relates to the continuation of the payment of pensions and other benefits to certain persons after they cease to be resident in Australia. It owes its origin to an Australian Labor Party Bill of which 1 gave notice on 8th December last and on which I made the second reading speech on 23rd March last. This earlier Bill had the purpose, as its long title showed, of amending the Social Services Act to make pensions payable to Australian citizens outside Australia. The present Bill has the advantage over the Bill which I introduced on behalf of the Labor Party of making pensions payable to persons living overseas even if they have not been or become Australian citizens. It has, however, 2 very great disadvantages. Its operation depends on reciprocal agreements with the countries in which the Australian pensioners have gone to live. This is a very conjectural benefit indeed. It also requires a 20 years residence in Australia before an age pensioner can receive benefits overseas. This is a very retrograde step. To highlight the deficiencies of this Bill, I move: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after That&#39; be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of opinion that the Bill should provide for the continuation of the payment of pensions and other benefits after a period of 10 years&#39; residence in Australia and irrespective of any agreement between Australia and the current place of residence&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The origin of the present Bill in the Bill which I presented on behalf of the Labor Party some months before is very clear from the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> The present Bill would never have been introduced but for my notice that I would be introducing a Bill on behalf of the Labor Party and but for my discussions over Christmas and last January with the governments of the main countries from which Australia draws migrants. The Minister was ill able to conceal his chagrin and spleen at the origin of the Bill and at my having introduced a Bill on behalf of the Labor Party so far ahead of his own Bill as is shown by some of the numerous and virulent comments which he made about my Bill when introducing his Bill. My Bill was an &#39;incompetent Bill&#39;, &#39;a maladroit Bill&#39;, with &#39;egregious errors&#39; and &#39;absurdities&#39;. Of course, I will readily concede that my Bill had the deficiency of being self-explanatory and self-contained. The beneficiaries of the present Bill would <inline font-style="italic">&#39;x</inline> hard put to it to understand it. But the Clerks of the House and I still believe in using simple, clear English. The Minister refused us the services of Parliamentary Counsel, and accordingly my Bill could not be said to be as complex or derivative as the Minister&#39;s Bill. I will give the Minister plenty of opportunity to explain what might appear to be some of the egregious errors and absurdities in his own Bill. I will give 3 instances. How, under his Bill, is one to apply the means test overseas? Assume that an Australian pensioner inherits a tourist hotel on the Costa del Sol or a castle in Spain. There is no right under the Bill to inspect the records. Apparently he will have to come back to Australia or Australian people will have to go over there to look at the title deeds and his accounts. </para>

              <para>- There will be plenty of ex-Ministers who will have time on their hands in private life to make such investigations as pensioners of the Department of Social Services before many months are over. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I give a second instance. An invalid pensioner living overseas could recover his health and thus presumably lose his pension.  His  disability might recur. In those circumstances must he return to Australia to be examined afresh? Under the Minister&#39;s Bill the test could be carried out only in Australia; the pension could be restored only in Australia. </para>
          <para>I give as a concluding example another apparent absurdity or egregious error. The mother of an Australian war bride in the United States becomes eligible by age or means to receive an age pension, or through bereavement to a widow&#39;s pension. Under the Minister&#39;s Bill she would have to return to Australia to be given the pension. </para>
          <para>I return to the 2 great deficiencies of this  Bin -  the fact that there will be no benefits payable under  it  except in countries with which Australia has concluded a reciprocal agreement and the fact that the only people eligible are those who have lived in Australia not for the normal 10 years which entitles them to an age pension, but for 20 years. </para>
          <para>The argument on reciprocal agreements is well expressed by a letter which my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> received last month from the  President  of the United Council of Immigrants. The letter stated:  all these good prospects and high expectations could be crushed if the portability of old age pensions overseas - given compliance With the requirements of residence and citizenship - was made to be conditional on the conclusion of the reciprocal agreements with foreign governments. </para>
          <para>First of all it would be practically impossible for the Australian Government to conclude agreements with all overseas countries. This would in any case result in protracted and frustrating negotiations because every country has its own domestic social services arrangements and specific national interests which might be very different to our concept of social services. Our Government has neither the power nor the right to suggest alterations of the legislation of other countries in order to allow the payment of overseas pensions. We are afraid that in the end we will arrive back to the same position as before when the Government always had a ready excuse in the absence of reciprocal agreements for not transferring pensions to countries other than the United Kingdom and New Zealand. </para>
          <para>But if we start from the principle that old age pensions are the right and the property of elderly people then their payment should not be prevented or limited to only certain countries and pensioners should be free to take their pensions at whatever other country they like, as long as they can cover the cost of living there. </para>
          <para>Our council has discussed this problem at length and has decided to appeal to you, as one of our elected representatives in the Federal Parliament, to support this point of view, which is fair and just for all concerned. Please give your vote for a humane cause so that lonely old people can re-unite with their families or friends wherever these might be, notwithstanding the conclusion of reciprocal agreements. </para>
          <para>Fortunately we have instances of the speed with which the present Government concludes reciprocal agreements with other countries. Discussions relating to the possibility of reciprocity in social service had commenced with representatives of Italy in May 1967, Yugoslavia in July 1967, Malta in January 1968, Germany in May 1968 and Turkey in March 1970. On 30th January the Prime Minister announced proposals to enable pensioners leaving Australia to receive their social service pensions in other countries and outlined the conditions under which the scheme would be given effect. </para>
          <para>On 4th February the Minister for Social Services announced that the heads of missions in Canberra representing the main migrant source countries had been advised of his intention to initiate discussions with a view to concluding negotiations on agreements for reciprocal portability of pensions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I must apologise for the turgid language; it is a quotation from Ministers. The countries concerned in this first approach were the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, France, Spain, Yugoslavia, Italy, West Germany, Greece, Malta and Turkey. The British and New Zealand High Commissioners were similarly informed. All other missions in Canberra had been appraised of the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement. </para>
          <para>On 10th May the Minister told the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> that encouraging replies had been received from Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain and that representatives of other countries were awaiting instructions from the home governments. </para>
          <para>I will give a specific instance. I refer to the longest standing negotiations, which have been with Italy from May 1967. As I told the House over 2 months ago in introducing my Bill, when I was in Italy last January I had no difficulty in securing a volume of bilateral treaties and conventions which Italy has made on social security, not only with European Economic Community countries but with other countries which are not in the Community such as Yugoslavia, the Iberian and Scandinavian countries and also Brazil and Argentina. I also was given information about the pending agreements with </para>
          <para class="block">Venezuela and the nature of the arrangements which have been made with the United States of America. The volume is over 1,300 pages. I merely refer to this to show that Italy has had no difficulty whatever in making arrangements on social security with countries which have a variety of social systems. But what has been Australia&#39;s record here? What has been the record of the Holt, Gorton and McMahon Governments. </para>
          <para>The Migration and Settlement Agreement between Australia and Italy was signed on 26th September 1967 but was not ratified until 8th June 1971. Article 35 of the Agreement, entitled &#39;Social Security&#39;, states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Each Government shall, to the extent permitted by the laws and regulations which are in force from time to time within its territory, ensure that the citizens of the other country settling in its territory receive  such  social service and national assistance benefits as it provides to its own citizens on the  same  terms as apply to its own citizens. </para>
            <para>The 2 governments will continue to study the possibility of entering a reciprocal agreement on the payment of the benefits contemplated by the respective social security systems. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This, I remind the House, was contained in an agreement signed on 26th September 1967. Although the Italian Under-Secretary of State for Emigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Alberto</inline> Bemporad. has twice visited Australia since the agreement was signed, the present Minister for Immigration did not see fit to visit Italy during his extensive overseas tour in October and November, aor in fact did he visit Yugoslavia, Malta or Turkey, with which negotiations have been proceeding for some years, as I have quoted, nor Denmark, Ireland and Spain with which negotiations have since been initiated. He has visited fewer than half of the countries which have been approached to make agreements. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, Article 37 of the Agreement with Italy provides that the 2 Governments shall make arrangements for the establishment of a joint commission. The Agreement, I again remind the House, was signed on 26th September 1967. This Joint Commission was not established until 20th January last and its first working meeting was not held until February last. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned the countries to which approaches have been made and from which encouraging responses have been achieved. I have also quoted the letter which my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler had received from the United Council of Immigrants. This Council is sponsored by organisations with Croatian, Italian, Dutch, Slovak, Swiss, Ukrainian, Polish, Estonian, Hungarian, Maltese, Latvian, Lithuanian and Romanian backgrounds. One would have thought that the Minister would show a bit more genuine interest and compassion where it lies within his ministerial responsibility for people from those countries. He frequently refers to those countries as captive nations. In this Bill he wants to make captive pensioners out of migrants from what he calls captive nations. I shall shortly give the number of migrants from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union, which incorporates Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. Incidentally, he made approaches to Turkey. How many Turkish migrants have been in Australia for 20 years? He has not approached Lebanon. Why has he not included Lebanon since it has an embassy here, since Lebanese migrate in greater numbers than Turks, since Lebanese have been in Australia in considerable numbers for years and since Lebanese are able and inclined to visit Lebanon for long periods? </para>
          <para>I leave the reciprocal agreements and come to the period of residence. In the late 1950s and the early 1960s the Labor Party conducted a successful campaign to secure age pensions for persons after 10 years residence instead of, as had been theretofore the case, 20 years residence in Australia. The Labor Party&#39;s campaign to reduce the qualifying period from 20 to 10 years for age pensions succeeded in making <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> as he then was, say in the 1961 election campaign that it was unreasonable that elderly migrants who had worked and paid taxes in Australia for lengthy periods could not qualify for age pensions. He went on in his policy speech to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We attach great importance to family migration because it helps assimilation in the new country. We will legislate to reduce the 20 years period to ten. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The McMahon Government is now setting the clock back. If persons - whether natural born or naturalised - are now to receive pensions when they live overseas they will have to have lived in Australia not just for 10 years, which is sufficient to entitle them to a pension if they continue to live in Australia, but for 20 years. We saw that, in its first Budget, the McMahon Government instituted a McMahon means test for pensioners. We now see that in this legislation we are to have a McMahon residence test. Why have the Prime Minister and his Government repudiated, not its immediate predecessor but the policy established 10 years ago by a Menzies Government? </para>
          <para>I give the consequences of this limitation. In my speech introducing the Australian Labor Party&#39;s Bill more than 2 months ago I pointed out the number of persons from our chief migrant countries who would benefit and the number who would not benefit from the increase in the period of qualifying residence in Australia from 10 to 20 years. I pointed out that 90.36 per cent of the Italians who have come to Australia had arrived in the last 20 years, 96.32 per cent of the Greeks, 84.79 per cent of the Dutch, 84.7 per cent of the Yugoslavs and 95.49 per cent of the Germans. This is the huge percentage of our migrants from our principal migrant source countries who will not receive benefits under this legislation, even if reciprocal agreements are achieved with their countries, because they have not been in Australia as residents for 20 years. </para>
          <para>Now I come to the captive pensioners from the captive nations, as the Minister calls them. These are the migrants who in general have been in Australia for more than 20 years, who would be entitled to pensions under the Labor Party&#39;s Bill but who will not be entitled to pensions under the McMahon Government&#39;s Bill because there is no prospect of having agreements with those countries </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Immigration, who interjects, has not visited those countries and his colleague the Minister for Social Services has not mentioned them as being countries to which approaches have been made. The Minister for Social Services is allowing his ideological preoccupations, in boycotting these nations, to deny their former citizens pension rights if they cease to live in Australia. Let me quote the figures which the Parliamentary Library has prepared for me of the number of persons from these countries who have been here for more than 10 years and who have been here for more than 20 years, respectively: Bulgaria 940 - 772, Czechoslovakia 11,947 - 10,702, Estonia 6,255-5,996, Hungary 27,390-12,794, Latvia 19,997 - 19,333, Lithuania 10,141- 9,929, Poland 77,881-69,405, Romania 2,442-1,895, Russia 14,627-8,279 and the Ukraine 10,829-10,478. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It will be seen by honourable members that the vast majority of the migrants from these captive nations, as the Minister describes them, have been in Australia for more than 20 years. They would be eligible for pensions under the Labor Party&#39;s Bill wherever they chose to live. Under the McMahon Government&#39;s Bill they will be denied pensions if they go to live in the countries of their origin because the Government will not seek arrangements with those countries; it has not even mentioned the matter to them. Yet we now have diplomatic relations with many of these countries. I give credit to the present Foreign Minister for extending Australia&#39;s diplomatic representation - by dual representation in most cases - to most of these countries which have an independent existence. But no approach has been made to them for reciprocal social service arrangements. </para>
          <para>The significance of all this is that Australia is not attracting as many migrants as it did and it is losing more migrants than ever. Despite these rhetorical speeches which are prepared for the Minister for Immigration about Australia&#39;s migrant intake, the fact is that the migrant intake is going down. The whole programme of sponsored migration is being phased out. The statistics show it. The Government accepts it. The Labor Party accepts it. We acknowledge that this is an irreversible trend. Australia is no longer a country which attracts people to leave the countries of their birth. Yesterday the Commonwealth Statistician produced the latest figures on overseas arrivals and departures. It turns out that for the first 9 months of the present financial year 103,000 migrants came to Australia. Twelve months before, the corresponding figure was 134,000. In the month of March this year the figure was 10,583 and in March last year it was 15,165. This is a feature which we ali accept - the decline in the volume of immigration. But to our shame we are suffering a very great degree of emigration by former migrants. The same figures show that in the first 9 months of this financial year 24,492 former migrants departed permanently. The corresponding figure in the year before was 22,574. In March this year the number of former migrants who departed permanently was 2,736 and in March last year it was 2,330. </para>
          <para>Going through the individual countries, we see that to the major source countries - the ones that I have quoted - Australia is losing more migrants in every successive month, or in each 9-month period, or in each financial year. In these circumstances we see the folly of being so parsimonious in this legislation. One of the reasons why people who have migrated to Australia are now leaving Australia, and why there are so many leaving, particularly those from the prime source countries, is that Australia does not now compare with those countries in welfare, health and housing standards. There is a growing inequality in Australia and a lessening inequality in those countries. There is a tradition in western Europe for enterprising young men to work in colonies or territories for a few years, and then to retire home. This was always the tendency, but the trend is becoming much stronger. Australia has benefited from thousands of such young men and their families coming here. We shall never retain them in this country unless we discard our pettifogging and begrudging welfare policies. </para>
          <para>There could scarcely be anything more begrudging than this Social Services Bill. The number of migrants who will be encouraged to come to and remain in Australia will be minute in terms of this Bill. There will be no cost to the nation - as I feel I established by quotations from this Minister and from previous Ministers when making my speech on the Labor Party&#39;s Bill more than 2 months ago - if people who go to live overseas, receive pensions which they have earned here. On this occasion, as on the occasion of the second reading of the Labor Party&#39;s Bill, I have dealt principally with the rights of migrants. I have not dealt with the situation of people who are Australian citizens, who were born here, who have always lived here. They will not have the right to pensions in other countries unless they go to Britain and New Zealand, with which countries there are already reciprocal agreements, or unless they go to countries with which reciprocal agreements are now made for the first time. At the present rate they would have to wait a very great time indeed before there was any reciprocal agreements with any countries other than Britain and New Zealand. </para>
          <para>It should be a matter of pride to Australia that so many migrants have come here. It should be a matter of shame to Australia that so many migrants are now leaving. Surely the general proposition is a matter quite apart from the cost of these proposals. If people have earned social service benefits in Australia, it should be no business of the Government where those people choose to receive their benefits. They have earned them and they should receive them wherever they choose to live. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Lalor can make his speech later. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, pointed out some of the crudities of the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s own Bill which repeated the shallowness of the Labor Party&#39;s approach to this problem, and the Leader of the Opposition has not chosen to answer those charges. He has not chosen to answer today the charge that he brought into this House a Bill purporting to be in the interests of migrants, which sought to confine the granting or the portability of pensions to Australian citizens, thereby excluding a large number of very good migrants to this country who have made a substantial contribution to it. The Leader of the Opposition has not answered the charge made by the Minister for Social Services that he brought into the House a Bill that would have precluded this country, through the mechanism of reciprocal agreements, from doing what it could in relation to Australian born residents of this country who wanted to go and live in other countries, and in relation to new migrants to this country, to get through our negotiating position the best possible deal on the rights that those migrants accrued in their countries of origin.. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has not answered that charge. In fact, in the very amendment he has moved he has stood firm on the same position. Of course, the fact is that the whole approach of honourable members opposite to this matter has been a result of their general attitude to migration. They suddenly woke up to the fact that they have offended, and deeply offended, a large proportion of our migrant population, and that many of our migrant population, because they have chosen to become Australian citizens, have votes. That is the reason for this exercise, which has been a rather crude, shallow attempt to retrieve the position and reach out for the migrant vote. However, in this process, as I have said and as the Minister for Social Services has said, the Opposition has advocated policies which even the migrants themselves will see are against their own best long term interests. </para>
          <para>If I may say so, it is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition that the facts do not appear to matter if he thinks he can achieve his objective; the damage he can do to our migration programme does not appear to matter if he thinks he can achieve his objective; the damage that he does to Australia, to our own country, does not appear to matter if he thinks he can achieve his immediate objective. Every argument the Leader of the Opposition used in this debate today, and when introducing his own Bill, and every statement he has made at naturalisation ceremonies - misusing ceremonies of naturalisation around the country - has been a distortion or a bending of the truth, as I will now proceed to demonstrate. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has claimed that negotiations for social service agreements with migrant source countries have dragged on for many years. In fact, our migration agreements with those countries did not and do not constitute a commitment to enter also into social service agreements with those countries, as the honourable gentleman well knows. We undertook, firstly, to study the possibility of reciprocal social service agreements and, secondly, to make efforts towards reaching agreements. Logically, a study of the possibility of reciprocal social service agreements must precede efforts towards reaching agreements. As the Minister for Social Services has already stated in this House, following consideration by Cabinet an inter-departmental committee was established as long ago as December 1969. </para>
          <para>It is indicative both of the complexity of the issues involved - something that the Leader of the Opposition has not even begun to understand - and also of the importance attached to them that the departments concerned, including my own Department, appointed very senior officers to work on this committee. The report of the committee went to Cabinet in December 1971. So much for the grandstanding of the Leader of the Opposition when he said that, somehow or other, he fixed this up on his trip overseas last Christmas. Although I cannot be quite certain of this, I would say that almost certainly the Minister&#39;s first submission to Cabinet reached the Cabinet office before the honourable gentleman ever left for overseas. As I said, it was followed by a submission to Cabinet in December and in January this year the decision was announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline></para>
          <para>Two months have elapsed since the study of the possibility of reciprocal social service agreements was completed and the findings endorsed by Cabinet. In that short time we have indicated generally to our migrant source countries that Australia would be happy to consider reciprocal agreements on portable pensions and we have specifically approached 13 governments of migrant source countries. All the Leader of the Opposition can talk about is that, in the process, we have not approached or been approached by representatives of the governments of what he called the captive nation countries. He cannot have had much contact with the representatives of the captive nations who have come to this country if he believes that any migrants from those countries will return to them, with or without a pension, while those countries remain under their present regimes. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has placed great emphasis on the words: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the fall in the number of migrants from countries from which we received a significant number of migrants since the last World War.. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition used that expression in his introductory speech to his own Bill earlier this session and he repeated it in his speech this afternoon. He claimed on both occasions that &#39;Australia is failing to attract migrants&#39;. They were the exact words used by the Leader of the Opposition. He said - I repeat the phrase - that &#39;Australia is failing to attract migrants&#39;. Yet the immigration policies of the Australian Labor Party advocate and require that the Commonwealth Government should withdraw from the search for migrants. The Leader of the Opposition has also said that, under a Labor government, fewer migrants would come to Australia. So far as our traditional source countries are concerned, this certainly is true. As 1 have pointed out on a number of occasions recently, the new policies of the Australian Labor Party in relation to our traditional sources would cut assisted migration from Britain by more than 60 per cent and virtually eliminate migration from such countries as Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, France, Switzerland, the United States of America and the countries of Latin America. In addition, the immigration policies of the Australian Labor Party would mean significantly fewer migrants coming to Australia from such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Malta. Indeed, it is because migrants from those countries realise this - and the Leader of the Opposition has woken up to the fact that they realise it - that he has begun to become concerned about the migrant vote in the coming election. This is the reason why he has rushed in with these ill-thought proposals in relation to pensions - because the migrants know that this will be the effect of the approach of the Australian Labor Party to migration. </para>
          <para>Yet, in the face of the proposals of the Australian Labor Party in relation to migration, the honourable gentleman has the hide to say that he is now concerned that Australia is failing to attract migrants. How well founded is that concern? To justify the assertion that Australia is failing to attract migrants, the Leader of the Opposition quoted statistics by which he sought to compare the number of migrants from various countries last year with what he described as the peak year. Logically, one would expect migration in any other year to be less than migration in the peak year. Quite apart from this exercise in logic, the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition are very seriously misleading, as are nearly all the figures quoted by him in every field. The peak year statistics which he has quoted relate in every instance to permanent and long term arrivals, whereas the figures he has quoted for 1970-71 relate to settler arrivals. Settler statistics are available for the period from January 1959 onwards. They show a quite different picture to that presented by the Leader of the Opposition. For example, in his speech on the second reading of his Bill, the Social Services Bill (No. 2) earlier this session he claimed that: </para>

              <para>- That is very good, coming from the honourable member who interjected. However, the number of settler arrivals from Lebanon in 1969-70 was 4,083, only 78 more than the 4,005 settlers from that country in 1970-71. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition said that the number of migrants from Germany had fallen from 63,982 to 4,872. In fact, the figure of 63,982 relates to the number of long-term and permanent arrivals, including displaced persons, who came to Australia in 1949-50. He referred also to a fall in migration from Cyprus. la fact, the 1,054 settler arrivals from that country in 1970-71, are the largest number recorded since settler statistics have been kept. He also said - without quoting from any statistics - that there was also a drop in the number of migrants from Yugoslavia. In this, the Leader of the Opposition was mathematically precise; there was a drop. In 1969-70- the peak year - 14,097 settlers arrived in Australia from Yugoslavia. In 1970-71, 14,096 settlers arrived in Australia from Yugoslavia- one fewer than in the previous record year. </para>
          <para>The year 1970-71 was not, however, the period of unrelieved gloom which the statistics quoted by the Leader of the Opposition might suggest. Settler arrivals in 1970-71 from such countries as the United States of America, Canada and other countries In the Americas, Switzerland, Portugal and the Union of South Africa were the highest ever recorded. However, this did not suit his argument. He could not misquote those figures so he did not mention them at all. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to the number of former settlers leaving Australia. He returned to that again this afternoon and quoted statistics to show that these numbers had increased. But the fact is that the number of overseas-born persons living in Australia has increased also. In December last an estimated 2.6 million people living in Australia had been born overseas. Measured against this very large settler element in our population and the fact that in the 3 years ended 30th June 1971 Australia received more than half a million migrants, the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition retreat into their true perspective. He stated also that 311,952 migrants were eligible for naturalisation but had not been naturalised. This is essentially a reiteration of a previous statement by him which I described at the time as a clear misrepresentation of the facts. In publicly correcting the statement on that occasion I said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That truth is that at 30th June 1971, the latest time for which statistics are available, there were 228,700 people eligible to seek naturalisation who had not applied for it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I pointed out also that the experience of the Department of Immigration gauged over 25 years of immigration was that migrants generally waited more than 8 years before deciding to apply for citizenship. The </para>
          <para class="block">Leader of the Opposition ignores this. He also ignores the fact that the proportion of eligible migrants who seek naturalisation in Australia compares more than favourably with the experiences pf other migrants - receiving countries. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support his speculations as to the reasons why a percentage of migrants hesitate to seek citizenship. To apply for citizenship is one of the most significant steps taken by a migrant in his new country. It is also a step which every migrant should undertake voluntarily of his or her own free will, without any suggestion of coercion. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has stated also that there is hesitation in recognising migrants&#39; professional or trade qualifications. He has given this as one of the reasons why they go home or do not come here in the first place. As to trade qualifications, a tripartite mission in 1968-69 visited 17 migrant-source countries and, following its report, new criteria have been introduced which are working very well. The position in regard to professional qualifications is far more complex. The role of the Commonwealth in this sphere has been limited, in the words of my colleague the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> a previous Minister for Immigration, to vigorous advocacy. Nevertheless, the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications established by the Commonwealth Government has, with the co-operation of the various professional associations and registration boards, been making a solid attack on the problems involved. </para>
          <para>Finally I want to put in its proper context the suggestion that in providing for a 20-year residential period for portable pensions the Government is denying this facility to the great majority of migrants. The Leader of the Opposition quoted figures intended to establish that the great majority of Italian, Greek, Dutch, Yugoslav and German migrants had been in Australia for less than 20 years. From this he concluded that the 20-year residential requirement for portable pensions would stop them from returning to their homelands with an Australian age pension. There is, I must admit, an even more fundamental reason why they cannot do this. The fact is that the great majority of migrants to whom the Leader of the Opposition refers are some 30 to 35 years too young to receive an Australian age pension, either here or in their homelands. By the time they are old enough to qualify for an age pension they also will have met the residential requirements for portability. </para>

            <para>- It is necessary for me to remind the House that we are discussing the Social Services Bill (No. 3). Whilst the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> gave us interesting but sometimes misleading information about immigration, he did not get very close to the Bill. I intend to be more precise. But let me say to him at the outset that migrants in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an immigration programme had it not been initiated by this Party. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has given information about the departure of migrants which must present itself as a very worrying problem to every honourable member. When something like 22,000 migrants who came to Australia under assisted passages have returned home within 2 years, there are good reasons why we should look around for the causes. I do not know about the association which the Minister for Immigration might have with the various migrant groups, but I receive very considerable correspondence from many of these organisations indicating their concern about many aspects of Australian life and their desire that those aspects might be improved. Foremost among the points of agitation is the contention that the social welfare system in Australia is relatively inferior to the systems in other parts of the world. I hold in my hand a letter dated 30th March 1972 from the Federation of Netherlands Societies Ltd to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> It is a long letter in which the Federation refers to the inadequacy of social services and says: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>We know from our own observation that this inadequacy causes feelings of insecurity in the minds of immigrants from the Netherlands, often leading to a decision to return to their country of origin, where the returnees find  a  system of social services, that is much further developed, that keeps in step with the rising cost of living and that knows no means test. </para>

              <para>- I am not sure but 1 will give the Minister a list of the countries that do have portable pensions without the trappings, the hang-ups and the inhibiting prohibitions imposed by this Government. I have referred to the Federation of Netherlands Societies Ltd of which there are many branches around Australia. Dutch people have come to Australia in large numbers. There was no reply to the Federation&#39;s letter to the Prime Minister. When I inquired by way of question placed on the parliamentary notice paper as to the reason, the Prime Minister said that neither he nor the department of Immigration had the address of the Federation of Netherlands Societies Ltd. Every honourable member on this side of the House, by virtue of the intensive contact he has had with that Federation and other migrant groups, would know not only the secretary&#39;s address but also the address of some members of the Federation. It is a reflection on the Government that the Prime Minister is so indifferent. </para>

          <para>This Social Services Bill is bereft of substance and bewildering in its objectivity. Its stated purpose is to facilitate the continuation of the payment of pensions and other benefits to certain persons after they cease to be resident in Australia. Let me put in sharp relief .the contrasting attitude of the 2 parties. The Liberal and Country Party side of the House says: &#39;We will provide for the portability of pensions only where we can get reciprocal agreements with other countries&#39;. The Labor Party says: Australian citizens shall not cease to receive pensions because of residence abroad&#39;. In taking that view we are in common in our stance with many other countries. This Bill will not achieve the end which the Government attributes to it. When this debate is concluded and the Bill receives the assent of the Senate and of the Governor-General and passes into the statute book, not one citizen will benefit in any way at all. If the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> who is sitting at the table, disagrees with me I would like him to indicate his disagreement because I will soon prove that he is incorrect in his assumptions. No-one will benefit when this Bill is passed - that is the first fact to be acknowledged. </para>
          <para>The mere sanctioning of this legislation will in no way compensate for this Government&#39;s dilatory approach to the longstanding need to provide for portability of Australian pensions. All this Bill purports to do is enable the Minister for Social Services to enter into agreements with other countries about the portability of pensions. It purports to do it, but in fact it cannot achieve that. Whether these agreements will, in fact, be entered into will depend on the acceptability or otherwise of the conditions which Australia and any prospective participating country may require. For that matter, the Minister has made the frank and incredible admission that the Bill is not necessary , at all. In his second reading speech he made that confession in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It would have been possible, of course, to carry out the Government&#39;s intention to make pensions payable abroad by agreements made by regulation under the provisions of section 137 of the existing Social Services Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister went on to indicate that the same result could have been achieved by regulation rather than Act of Parliament, but he thought that this process would be inappropriate. Why would it be inappropriate? It seems to me that it would be inappropriate for the simple reason that the Government wanted to engage in a window dressing process in this period preceding the election campaign to give the migrants around Australia and those Australians who may be considering living abroad the idea that the Government at last was doing something positive about this question. It is inappropriate simply because the Leader of the Opposition goaded the Government into some course of action by the introduction of a private member&#39;s Bill some weeks ago. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the Government&#39;s record in respect of the negotiation of reciprocal agreements. Australia concluded a reciprocal agreement on social security with the United Kingdom on 8th June 1953, and the agreement commenced to operate in 1954. The negotiations commenced 19 years ago. There have been 2 amendments since- one is 1958 and the second in 1962, 10 years ago. Little of consequence, apart from the agreement with New Zealand, has been achieved since then. The Minister says that he has been engaged in negotiations with Italy since May 1967. It is 5 years since those negotiations were initiated and still there has been no progress report. With Yugoslavia, negotiations commenced in July 1967, nearly 5 years ago; with Malta, in January 1968, nearly 4 years ago; with Germany, in May 1968, 4 years ago and with Turkey, in March 1970, over 2 years ago. It would have been helpful if the Minister, in his second reading speech, had indicated the likelihood of concluding some of those agreements, but he made no such mention. </para>
          <para>Before the Parliament goes into recess he wants to herald out to the nation the vague idea that something is in progress, but he will not give the House or the country sufficient details. Obviously these negotiations will drag on. No agreements have been negotiated with any prospective participating country and some time may elapse before they ever will be. In fact it is both possible and likely that no further results will accrue in the limited lifetime of this Parliament and Government. None of the Minister&#39;s bleating alibis can condone the McMahon Government&#39;s failure and his lack of success and initiative in giving effect to this universally acclaimed reform. This Bill is not only a death bed repentance on the part of this Government but, I believe, it is also a hoax - a blatant attempt to whitewash the years of neglect that have characterised the Government&#39;s mishandling and non-handling of this issue. The issue is very simple. It is the need to provide for the portability of pensions. It can be achieved by the stroke of the Minister&#39;s &#39;Eversharp&#39; and it is no more complicated than that. The Labor Party acknowledged this a long while ago. In fact, in 1965 - 7 years ago - the Australian Labor Party formally took a decision on this matter and made its commitment at its 1965 Federal Conference in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That Australian citizens shall not cease to receive pensions because of residence abroad. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Labor Party&#39;s unambiguous, unequivocal commitment and if, after this year&#39;s elections, there is a change of government that is the uncluttered and positive result that will accrue. It is as plain and straightforward as that. Had the Government not prevailed in the interim since 1965 when that decision was taken, the principle would have been given effect to long ago - 7 years ago. But in any case Labor will do so after the next elections. </para>
          <para>In his second reading speech the Minister said that this matter went to Cabinet - this indecisive, procrastinating Cabinet - 3 years ago when an interdepartmental committee was appointed to examine it. One can hardly feel that Cabinet was excited about the whole matter - about the implementive needs of this great principle - when 3 years ago a decision was taken to look at it. The interdepartmental committee deliberated on the basic principle for 2 long years and then submitted its secret report to Cabinet 6 months ago. The sequel to this long wait is what we have now in the form of this Social Services Bill (No. 3) which does not offer anything tangible at all but which obviously is designed to mislead the migrants in particular and those Australians who may choose to live overseas in their retirement. </para>
          <para>The Minister, with characteristic impetuosity, has brought this unnecessary Bill to the Parliament with the announcement that he has written letters to embassies about the matter. I should like to see copies of those letters. I doubt whether any of them are competent or substantial. It would be interesting to see them tabled because it is quite likely that a superficial job is being done even at this time. The Minister can soon disabuse me on this matter by making available some details of his negotiations. The whole sorry story, the whole historical cavalcade of events, makes a laughing stock of any sincerity which the Government claims about its concern for the welfare of our migrant community whose desires and interests have been denied. Everything the Minister said in his second reading speech points to a tendency to envelope any arrangement which Australia may make with other countries about the portability of pensions with petty, pinchpenny and pedantic quibbles. </para>
          <para>In fact the Government clearly has set out to get everything it can on the cheap. The Minister has made it clear that a condition of any agreement will be that the participating country will be required to make its own pension available to those former residents living in Australia; otherwise we assume that there will be no agreement at all. Insistence on that requirement will imperil the chance of any agreement with many countries. Clearly the net result will be that some migrants may come to enjoy the right of portability to the country to which they want to go while others, whose countries do not co-operate, will be denied it. So we will have this divisive characteristic injected into our social service scheme. </para>
          <para>It is apparent that to minimise expenditure on social services - to cut the cost - New Australians who establish pension eligibility by age, invalidity or widowhood and who meet residential qualifications will then run the rigours of the means test. The Leader of the Opposition has asked about the problems in that regard. They will first have to show that they have gained any pension to which they may have an entitlement in their homeland as this would bear on their Australian entitlement under the provisions of the means test. For that matter, the means test will trouble, haunt and plague the New Australian pensioner whether he chooses to live in Australia or in his homeland. If he receives a part pension from his homeland, his Australian pension will vary with every variation of the rate of pension paid overseas. <inline font-style="italic">To</inline> administer the scheme the Commonwealth Department of Social Services necessarily will introduce new internal and overseas appendages to that part of the bureaucracy which constantly sends out questionnaires and otherwise probes and pries into the pensioner&#39;s private income and assets. All of this is aggravated by the Minister&#39;s insistence that countries can be regarded as participants only if they agree to extend their pension benefit to former nationals now in Australia. I believe that many countries will baulk at such requirements. </para>
          <para>I remind the House of the very fundamental declaration of human rights which, in article 13, says that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his country. Article 22 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But the fact is that migrants who leave Australia, who have earned their pensions here, cannot have social security under the present arrangements. My colleague, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> has referred to the contentions made by the United Council of Immigrants. He read out some of the extracts of the submission which that Council has made to many members of this House. I ask whether any of these contentions are unreasonable. The Council says that pensions are the right and the property of elderly people. Does anyone disagree with that? I certainly hope not. The Council contends that the payment of pensions should not be limited to only certain countries. Does anyone say that payments should be limited according to the country in which people live? I take it that silence is acquiescence. The Council also says that pensioners should be free to take their pensions to whichever country they like. Is that an undesirable principle? </para>
          <para>I remind honourable members that when we talk of the United Council of Immigrants, the Council whose policy has been embraced today completely and unambiguously by the Australian Labor Party, we are speaking of the Central Council of Croatian Associations in Australia, the Italian Welfare Centre Co., the Netherlands Society of Sydney, the Association of Australian Slovaks, the Swiss Club of New South Wales, the Ukrainian Society of New South Wales, the Federal Council of Polish Associations, the Estonian Society in Sydney, the Hungarian Council of New South Wales, the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, the Latvian community in Sydney, the Lithuanian community in Sydney and the Australian Romanian Association. Today the Leader of the Opposition spoke for the many thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of the members of those organisations, and I also speak for them at this time. I want to indicate our very grave dissatisfaction with the attitude taken by the Government. The clear fact of the matter is that many of these persons have contributed substantially to their pension entitlement. </para>
          <para>I will not have time to look at the taxation scales in this regard, but if one takes, for example, a single taxpayer - and I have a chart which would enable me to give many examples - one finds that the average weekly earnings of a single taxpayer is $84.70 a week. At the present rate of taxation he would be paying $13.15 a week or $683 a year in taxation. Over the 20 years in which such a person would be required to be resident in Australia to establish eligibility under the scheme proposed by the Minister, he would pay in direct taxation no less than $13,676. My colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> would quickly say: &#39;Indirect tax in volume at least equals direct tax&#39;. If this were the case such a person would pay approximately $27,000 or $28,000 in taxation in those 20 years. This Government is saying that if such a person has cause to return to his country of origin he will be deprived of his right to a pension. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to a case in my own electorate which came to my attention only last week. It involves a Czechoslovakian person who has been in Australia for about 30 years. He had the misfortune to lose his married daughter who was a widow with several children in Czechoslovakia. Now he has to return to that country to look after the children. He is receiving a pension in Australia, but if he returns to Czechoslovakia, where he would have no pension entitlement, this Government intends to deprive him of his means of sustenance. He will have no pension at all in those circumstances. </para>
          <para>The issue is quite clear. The House has to make up its mind whether it will be caught up in all these unnecessary trappings or whether it will have regard to the practical fact and make pensions available to people who earn them, regardless of where they live. Included in the countries which already pay such pensions are Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Malta, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Sweden in certain circumstances. If those countries can do it, Australia can do it. We have been dragging the chain for too long. If the Government is not prepared to do it, I believe that the people ought to take the earliest possible opportunity to remove it from trie treasury bench. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> has said that the Australian Labor Party has acknowledged this question of portability of pensions for a very long time. Therefore, one would think that honourable members opposite would have had time to think about it. One would think that they would have had time, when they introduced a Bill on this very matter only a few weeks ago, to have included in it the propositions which they advance today. One would think they would have included in that Bill the sorts of propositions which they now want to enshrine in this Bill, which are set out in the amendment which they have moved to this Bill. But that is far from the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Hughes talked in terms of the unequivocal commitments which the Labor Party has made on this question of the portability of pensions. I should have thought that the only unequivocal commitments which the Labor Party has made on this and just about every other question are to a 10 bob each way bet on policy issues and to overall bribery of the Australian people by promising what is very nearly the earth. lt has promised to spend thousands of millions of dollars of the Australian taxpayers&#39; money. As I say, the Labor Party&#39;s stand on this issue is typical of its whole approach to policy formation. </para>
          <para>A few weeks ago the Labor Party came forward with a quite clear policy on this issue, it presented a Bill which the Leader of the Opposition described as a Bill in good simple English. Indeed, it was a Bill in good but simplistic English, because it stated that people who are Australian citizens will be able to carry their pensions outside Australia. The Leader of the Opposition included a number of types of pensioners. He included widow and age pensioners. The Labor Party, in its amendment to the Government&#39;s Bill, is completely ignoring its previous proposition that portability of pensions should apply to Australian citizens. Another absolutely fundamental proposition was advanced in the Opposition&#39;s earlier Bill, and it was that pensions should be paid to Australian citizens who went abroad, no matter what period of residence they had had in Australia before either going to their homeland or to some other country. There was no residential qualification whatsoever in that Bill, apart, of course, from the naturalisation requirement. </para>
          <para>When I came into the House today and saw the amendment which the Opposition had moved I was amazed to find that the </para>
          <para class="block">Opposition wants to enshrine a 10 year residence qualification in the Bill which is before us. Under the Government&#39;s proposal standard pensions will be paid to people who leave Australia after 20 years residence in Australia. That 20 years period of residence can be an aggregate period; it does not have to be one continuous residence. But it is important to point out that under the Bill a pension will be paid to any invalid pensioner, no matter what his period of residence in Australia has been. A pension also will be paid to a widow pensioner who leaves Australia to live in any other country with which we have a reciprocal arrangement. There is no residence qualification required in regard to invalid and widow pensions, but I point out that the proposition which the Labor Party previously advanced contained the qualification that those who would benefit had to be Australian citizens. </para>
          <para>The effect of this legislation is that a pension will be paid to those who go overseas after they have resided in Australia for a reasonable period, and there are very good reasons for this provision. It would be absurd for Australia to become a sort of Mexico pension haven, lt would be absurd to pay pensions to people who might come and live in Australia for only a year - at whatever point in their lives - and then go and live overseas from then on. 1 think the people of Australia would regard it as a highly reasonable proposition that there should be a period of residence qualification except, of course, in cases involving problems such as widowhood or where the new arrival in Australia is at some point struck down by illness. I think the good sense of the Australian people will enable them to understand fully the reasoning behind this measure. </para>
          <para>We want to do all that we can for those migrants who come to Australia but who decide that they want to leave, at the same time not being unfair to the basic Australian taxpayer. In one important respect the Government&#39;s propositions are more generous than the propositions of the Labor Party in this area. I refer to Labor&#39;s original proposition regarding naturalisation. If we did not pay pensions overseas to persons who had not been naturalised we could exclude a large number of people - nearly a quarter of a million </para>
          <para class="block">Australians - from receiving pension rights. Nearly a quarter of a million people who have come from other nations to live in Australia and who have qualified to be naturalised as Australians have not been naturalised. In other words, nearly a quarter of a million Australians could not possibly qualify for a pension under the basic proposition which, as we heard propounded by the honourable member for Hughes, the Labor Party has brought forward and which had been given so much consideration over so many years. </para>
          <para>Let us compare and contrast that proposition with the number of people who would miss out under the Government&#39;s proposal contained in the substantive legislation which we are now considering. Under the Government&#39;s legislation those people who would miss out would be those standard age pensioners who have not put in 20 years in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition attempted to show by citing figures that because the bulk of migrants from other countries has arrived in Australia only in the last 20 years, therefore they would miss out under the Government&#39;s proposal. What an extraordinary proposition. The whole question is: What are the ages of the migrants upon their arrival in Australia? Whatever measure we use, the ages of migrants on arrival in Australia make it quite clear that the overwhelming majority of all settlers in Australia, permanent or long term arrivals, involve people who are under the age of 45 years which would therefore place them in a position to take out the full benefits of the age provision. Of course, like anyone else they are entitled to the other social service benefits. </para>
          <para>If we look at the statistics relating to the age of permanent and long term arrivals in Australia for the period 1945 to 1971 we find that 11.3 per cent of all arrivals in Australia in that period were older than 45 years of age. They are the ones who would not qualify under the Government&#39;s legislation. But of course a good many of them may well qualify for the widow pension or an invalid pension. In terms of numbers the 11.3 per cent is equivalent to approximately 400,000 people who have arrived in Australia during the whole period of the post-war migration programme. Many of those people would, of course, be deceased. I do not have the sort of figures that would disclose how many of them are living but a very large number of them would be deceased. So we take a figure way under the 40,000 and compare that with the 230,000-odd people who would not qualify under the proposal which the Labor Party originated in a Bill before this House. We now find that the Labor Party, having perhaps seen some of the errors of its ways, has changed its whole approach and decided to attempt to alter by way of amendment the provisions contained in this Bill by seeking to reduce the period of 20- years residence to 10 years. If this period is reduced to 10 years I believe - and I am open to correction to this - that we would still run into the possibility of people staying in Australia merely to qualify for the pension and then moving on. </para>
          <para>We heard from the Leader of the Opposition a good deal of talk about reciprocal arrangements and the fact that it was necessary for reciprocal arrangements to be made before any person could qualify for a pension. This looks all right at first sight. It looks as if there might be some ground for criticism, until we get an assurance from the Minister for Social Services, which I am sure he can give, that he does not expect to encounter difficulties in making reciprocal arrangements. It is clear also from what he has said already that his whole aim in making reciprocal arrangements is to safeguard the interests of those people who have migrated to Australia in recent years and who might have trouble with their pensions if reciprocal arrangements are not made. </para>
          <para>The Minister has been chastised by the Leader of the Opposition for refusing to make or for not making arrangements with what the Leader of the Opposition described as &#39;captive nations&#39;. The Minister, so far as I understand it, has at no point said that arrangements would not be made with captive nations. The Minister would be as aware as is any other person in this House or in this country that there would be remarkably few people in Australia who migrated here from captive nations who would want to return to those nations. It would be clear also to any one who knows anything about this that those people who have come to Australia from captive nations and who have decided to move from Australia to another country, apart from the country from which they originally came, will have the benefit, wherever they go. It is always open to the Government to attempt to make arrangements, should the need arise, with the so called captive nations. </para>
          <para>In view of the limited time that we have in which to dispose of the rest of the business of the House before the House rises, perhaps at a later hour today, I say in conclusion that I find the whole approach of the Opposition in this area to be absolutely typical. It is a 10-bob each way approach. It has flung a proposition into the ring in an attempt to buy support or bribe support. The Opposition finds that it is a goer, so it comes forward with an amendment to a substantial measure which the Government has brought forward. It is an amendment which does not really meet the needs of the basic Australian taxpayer or the needs of the pensioners whom we are aiming to help with this legislation. </para>

            <para>- The speakers on the Government side who have taken part in this debate have spent most of their time attacking a Bill which was presented by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> instead of defending the Bill which is now before the House. Quite obviously the reason for this is that the Bill presented by this Government is completely indefensible. The honourable member for Chisholm <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> proved the Government&#39;s insincerity by expressing the fear that people may come from some other country, reside in Australia for a period of 12 months and then leave Australia with a pension. He knows that this is completely impossible and is a complete paradox because the Government&#39;s own law demands that an immigrant reside in Australia for at least 10 years before he becomes eligible for a pension. But he is not eligible for portability rights until he has resided here for 20 years whereas a resident of Australia, if this Bill is passed, will be eligible to go overseas at any time and take his pension with him. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> which seeks to insert the following words: </para>

          <para class="block">In this passage the Minister does not describe the sequence of events which led to the presentation of his Bill.

He referred pompously to the great complex issues involved in the granting of these pensions. Is the Minister honestly and sincerely of the opinion that the electorate will believe that a simple matter can be made complex and difficult merely by naming the matter difficult and complex? If there is any complexity and difficulty in continuing pensions already granted, it is administrative and administrative only. The more the Government speaks out on this issue the more obvious it becomes that this Bill is merely a mirage intended to mislead our migrant community and other deserving Australian citizens who are thirsting in this Government&#39;s dry, barren desert of social services. The Government has introduced this Bill because it is afraid of the outraged voices of the migrant community, whose legitimate demands through the correct channels it has for <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> long ignored. The Government&#39;s action reminds me of the words of T. S. Eliot: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The last temptation is the greatest treason, To do the right thing for the wrong reason. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But of course the Government is not doing the right thing; it is dissembling. It is attempting to persuade people that it is belatedly granting them their just entitlement, while it has no intention of doing that. The proof that the Government is not acting in good faith is implicitly but nonetheless clearly stated in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bill now before us provides that the Minister may enter into an agreement with other countries, which, while any such agreement is in force, become &#39;participating countries&#39;. The pensions with which the Bill deals may be paid to Australian pensioners who go to reside, whether permanently or temporarily in those other countries, or who are travelling with reasonable expedition between them and Australia, or, indeed between any 2 participating countries. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In this passage the Minister tells us that should portable pensions become a reality Australians also may enjoy the benefits. One would like to know why they have not always done so. The real issue, surely, is the need to introduce these pensions quickly for those whose real need is now. If the Government has a genuine interest in introducing these measures to permit the portability of pensions overseas, why has it made them conditional on the conclusion of reciprocal agreements with other governments? By all means obtain the greatest possible benefits for those people already resident here. They should have nothing to do with reciprocal agreements with other countries. We could have a situation in which the people of perhaps Turkey and Italy could take their pensions home to their birth places, whereas those from Spain, Lebanon and Greece could not. In view of the fact that it has been shown that the Australian community would show no financial loss as a result of the unilateral introduction of portability of pensions, because of the savings in pension concessions presently made by transport, housing, medical and hospital authorities - concessions which pensioners receive if they stay in this country, but which they will not take with them when moving overseas - could we not agree that there was some substance in the remarks of the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> in this House recently? On that occasion the honourable member said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister and the Government he represents have a complete contempt for immigrants. What they want is people coming to Australia, doing the hard work, taking the labouring jobs, doing  the  dirty work, keeping quiet, and voting for the Liberal Party. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister said that the Government had 3 considerations in mind when drafting the Bill. The first was to ensure that the benefits of portability were available to all Australian pensioners, whether they were Australian citizens or not. If this is true there can be no doubt that the Minister and the Government deserve praise for their sentiments. But of course it is not true. If this Bill is passed in its present state unamended there is no doubt that during the next few years the beneficiaries will be Australian citizens only. The very fact that the primary condition of portability of pensions demands the alteration of the legislation of participating countries guarantees this result. </para>
          <para>The second consideration of which the Government was mindful, according to the Minister, was the need to ensure in negotiation that migrants from other countries received the greatest possible reciprocal benefits from their countries. I am astounded by this revelation, because what the Minister is saying is that his Government is quite prepared to deny justice to some members of this community to gain justice for some members who are owed justice by another community. To have such a cavalier attitude towards the rights of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the welfare of migrants or pensioners. Let us be sure and understand that it is migrants and pensioners about whom we are talking when we discuss this Bill. It probably sounded good and pleasing to the ear of the Minister when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">But I can give an unequivocal assurance to these former residents of other countries who are now living amongst us that in my negotiations with their former homeland 1 will press their interest to the uttermost. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Why did he not add to his final sentence these words: &#39;By withholding the pensions of those citizens of that homeland who worked so hard in this country but wanted to die in their own.&#39; lt is a terrible thing that the Government intends to do. It intends to use the pension rights of persons who intend to return to their homelands to win pension rights from the homeland of pensioners who have come to Australia. Why did the Government not negotiate pension agreements during the period when our need of people was matched by the needs of many countries to send their people around the world to wherever work was to be found? </para>
          <para>The third consideration of the Government, the Minister said, was the need to protect the Australian taxpayer against abuse of the new provisions by persons who might come to Australia at some future time for the express purpose of taking advantage of these concessions. The Minister&#39;s concern for the Australian taxpayer is laudable. But which Australian taxpayer are he and his Government concerned about? Surely the persons who will take advantage of the portability of pensions were taxpayers, and surely if they worked in the hardest jobs they contributed a good deal more to the national purse than did taxpayers in other categories of work. Does the Minister believe that these people should be denied their portable pensions because some unscrupulous persons might not have pulled their weight? Surely it is better that some people get more than they deserve than that the great majority are denied justice. The Government should support the principle that old age pensions are the right of those who are elderly, and their payment should not be tied to the place of residence of the recipient, nor should they be dependent upon the conclusion of reciprocal agreements with other countries before they can be permitted to take effect. A Labor government would remove these injustices and anomalies. </para>

            <para>-  Hundreds of thousands of migrants who have made Australia their homeland since the Second World War will welcome this Government legislation. Many of these migrants have settled in the Murray electorate. In Australia as a whole, many primary and secondary industries would not have been able to achieve the degree of excellence they have achieved without the contribution of migrants. I have spoken to a number of migrants about this legislation. They have made 2 points in particular to me. One is that through the passage of this legislation and the reciprocal arrangements that will be made with other countries these migrants in Australia will be provided with a better feeling of equality and status in this country because their own homeland will have negotiated, on an equal footing, a reciprocal agreement with Australia. This is a matter of some pride and importance to them. Secondly it will provide encouragement to these migrants to become more involved in our community because they will feel more a part of it. 1 believe that this legislation also will encourage them to make a greater contribution to the Australian economy because they will feel that they have a stake in it - a stake that will not be removed if they return to their homeland. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This legislation will operate at no great cost to the Australian taxpayer. Any cost would be more than compensated by the fact that migrants have earned this right after having earned their livelihood in Australia. This measure will provide a great measure of justice to them. Of course, this benefit will also be available to Australians by birth who decide to settle in any country with which reciprocal agreements are reached. It will be available to migrants who may not wish to return to their country of origin but who may wish to go to some other country with which we have a reciprocal agreement. </para>
          <para>There are 3 key requirements or points of difference in the legislation now before us and the original Bill which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on behalf of the Australian Labor Party on 23 rd March as well as the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the Bill before us. The first difference is that of reciprocal agreements. I believe that it is important both to our country and to the migrants concerned thai reciprocal agreements be reached with their countries because only by reciprocity can this Government obtain the best deal for the migrants who would wish to move to another country. Also, only by way of reciprocity will the taxpayers of this country be protected against some form of double dealing. The only legal guarantee that can be provided against double payment of pensions is through reciprocal agreements. I think it is important from the taxpayers&#39; point of view that we have reciprocal agreements. </para>
          <para>The impression the Labor Party would give is that Australia is the only country which requires reciprocal arrangements before allowing the payment of portable pensions. 1 would like to mention some of the countries which require reciprocity. The Research Service in the Parliamentary Library has provided this information for me. The countries are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United States of America, France and Yugoslavia. There are some countries which do not require reciprocity arrangements. But before jumping to the conclusion that this is necessarily a good thing from the migrant&#39;s point of view, we should look a little closer into these countries to see what form of pension scheme they provide. Most of these countries provide a contributory superannuation scheme, which means that a separate, special and additional tax has to be paid by the people of those countries before they are entitled to any of these old age or other pension benefits. If one looks at the requirements of those contributory schemes one will find that a minimum number of payments or contributions has to be made by a person before that superannuation payment or pension is available to him in another country. So we have 2 points here that really demolish the argument that there is no need for reciprocity. First of all, a person living in such a country is paying tax at a far higher rate than what he would be if he lived in this country because of special superannuation taxes. Secondly, there is a special requirement concerning time of residence because of the minimum number of contributions that has to be made before a superannuation payment or pension is available to a person in that country or the country to which he may move. </para>
          <para>The second difference between the 2 pieces of legislation is the requirement of citizenship. The Labor Party Bill introduced on 23rd March requires that pensions and social service benefits will be available only to citizens of Australia. This is absurd because the migrant who is most likely to take advantage of portability of pensions is that migrant who does not become a citizen of this country. This is possibly the major reason why he does not take up Australian citizenship. He has the feeling that he may wish to return to his own country and spend the rest of his days in the country of his birth. He does not become an Australian citizen for this reason. If the Labor Party Bill were enacted it would stop these people from obtaining this justice and ending their days as they so obviously wish to end them. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> threw considerable doubt on figures provided by the Leader of the Opposition on the general question of migration and so on. Just to make the point I will use the figures of the Leader of the Opposition to show the absurdity of the Labor Party&#39;s argument. I would like to quote from the speech the Leader of the Opposition made on 23rd March when introducing his Bill. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It transpires that 662,898 persons had been naturalised up to the end of the last financial year, and the number of persons who were eligible to be naturalised but who had - not been naturalised was 311,952. That meant that 32 per cent of the people who could  have been naturalised had not been naturalised. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So, on the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s own figures, one-third of all migrants who come to Australia would be deprived of their rights of the Labor Party&#39;s Bill which requires citizenship were passed. Also, I believe that if the Labor Party&#39;s Bill were passed citizenship would be forced on these people under duress. In other words, a migrant would feel that if he were ever to get portability of pension he would be forced to be an Australian citizen. I do not believe that this is a correct way to encourage people to become citizens of this country. </para>
          <para>The third point or key requirement concerns the qualifying period. As previous speakers on the Government side have pointed out, the qualifying period of 20 years residence after the person concerned has reached the age of 16 is for only the age pension. Surely the basic disqualification of anyone for an age pension, whether he wishes to live in Australia or move to another country, is his age. The vast majority of migrants would require at least 20 years after the time they came to Australia before they could qualify, not because of a residential qualification but simply because they have not reached old age. The question of the residential requirement also applies only to an old age pensioner. 1 would like to quote from the second reading speech made by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> on 13th April 1972. He said:   but there will be no residence qualification required for this portability in the case of invalid pensioners arising from a disease or injury contracted in Australia by a permanent resident, or in the case of widows&#39; pensions, when the husband&#39;s death occurred while the couple were permanently in Australia. Portability will extend to the pensioner&#39;s wife&#39;s allowance, and also to the special pension payable for 12 weeks after the death of a member of a married couple. </para>
          <para class="block">Just to make sure that there is no misunderstanding on this point, 1 would now like to quote the amendment moved on  behalf  of the Labor Party today and  in  particular I draw the attention of  (Honourable  members to that part of the amendment referring to the residential qualification. The amendment states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should provide for the continuation of the payment of pensions and other benefits after a period of 10 years&#39; residence in Australia and irrespective of any agreement between Australia and the current place of residence. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This means that, with regard to the great range of other issues and benefits, a longer period of residence would bc required in Australia by the Labor Party amendment than is required by the Government&#39;s legislation. Ff we weigh up all the points in  regard  to residential qualification we see that easily the better deal for the migrant is contained in the Government&#39;s legislation. Compared with the residential qualifications in other countries, the standard  set  by Australia is generous. 1 remind honourable members that if they look a little more closely at the requirements of some of these other countries which have contributory pension schemes, they  will find  that, because a  minimum  number of contributions is required before benefit is payable either in the home country or in any other country, our requirements are very generous. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Government&#39;s legislation will provide justice for people who have made Australia their home and who have served Australia well, ft will be provided at no great cost to the Australian citizen. The legislation will provide migrants with a more equitable basis of portability than the alternative offered by the Labor Party would provide - if anybody can sort out which of the 2 approaches provided by the Labor Party in the last 3 months in this place is the one that it really means. Is it the Opposition&#39;s Bill of 23rd March or is it the Opposition&#39;s amendment to this legislation today? If the Opposition could sort that out, at least that would be some contribution to this debate. I congratulate the Government on the legislation and I support it. </para>

            <para>- It is remarkable how much of the Government&#39;s argument in this debate has avoided the merits or demerits of the Bill before the House and has concentrated on the Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> about 2 months ago. If it will help to clear the decks and return this debate to its proper subject matter let me say that I, for one, am happy to state that this Bill is better than the earlier Opposition Bill in at least one respect. I refer to the absence in the present Bill of the need for naturalisation. Indeed, I go further than that and acknowledge that the Bill presently before the House, even unamended, represents an important advance in our social welfare thinking. However, the Bill has 2 major weaknesses. Criticisms on the score of these weaknesses have not been replied to effectively by Government speakers. The purpose of the Opposition is to try to overcome them. Accordingly, our amendment relates, firstly, to the possibility of reducing the residential qualification for overseas payment of the age pension from 20 years to 10 years and, secondly, to the desirability of avoiding the requirement of reciprocity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As will readily be appreciated, 1 think, both of these matters depend in the last resort on our conception of the nature of the pension system itself. The truth is that after many years during which our social services were regarded as so many forms of charity there  is  at last some generalised agreement that social services are not a charity at all but a right - a right based, most often, on one&#39;s contribution to the Australian community but, in special circumstances, on  simple  membership of it. Let me take the age pension first. If that is a right based on one&#39;s residence in Australia and one&#39;s contribution during that time to the nation&#39;s prosperity and advancement, at what point of time should we say that that right has accrued? We could say after 5, 10 or 20 years resident. The choice is essentially arbitrary and is at our discretion. But what we cannot say, either in fairness or in logic, is that such a right accrues at one point of time for one person and at a different time for another. Either the right has accrued or it has not. Accordingly, it is impossible to discern any rational explanation for the proposition that an Australian age pension should be payable in Australia after only 10 years residence but not payable abroad until 20 years residence has been established. </para>
          <para>The second reading speech of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> was entirely unconvincing on this point. Condensing his words, his attempt at justification came down to this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We do not want the position where a person can come here for a short time, qualify for an Australian pension, and take it back home with him without having really contributed to the prosperity and progress of Australia ... It is for this reason that ... we have prescribed a qualifying period of 20 years - which is more generous, for example, than what is done in Canada, where the qualifying period is 25 years for portability of the old age security pension. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This boils down to suggesting that 20 years is appropriate here because we would then be more generous than Canada, or that a 10~year residential requirement would not be enough to deter migrants who were interested in coming to Australia for no other reason than to qualify for the age pension. The first of these propositions is irrelevant and the second is inconsistent with our established principles of eligibility for pension payments in this country. </para>
          <para>As long ago as 1962 we reduced the residential qualification for the age pension to 10 years. Surely that involved a twofold recognition - firstly that a 10-year period was enough to establish a right, and secondly that it was also sufficient to deter improper advantage being taken of the system. So far as 1 am aware it has never been suggested since, that the 1962 legislation was mistaken in either of its assumptions. Yet it is only such a mistake that could justify the return to a 20-year residential period in the present Bill. Much the same considerations apply to the argument against the need for reciprocity. I can appreciate the Minister&#39;s view in this matter but I am sure that he is wrong. Again condensing his words, he said in his second reading speech: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. we wanted to ensure in negotiation the greatest possible reciprocal benefits for migrants from other countries who live in Australia. In some cases, their original countries of residence allow them to bring their pensions with them, but this is far from true in all cases. If we simply grant portability of Australian pensions overseas, without getting anything for our settlers in return  . . then we throw these settlers to the wolves. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">To that I would say 2 things. We would not be throwing these settlers to the wolves; we would in fact be leaving them in no worse position than they are in now. But worse than that, our failure to achieve acceptable reciprocity with certain countries would mean that we were throwing our own presently qualified pensioners to the wolves if they needed or wished to live in such countries. All this with no improvement at all in the position of those settlers for whom the Minister has expressed his concern. The Government has accepted the principle of international portability of Australian pensions. That is a good and welcome principle, and the less we encumber it with unnecessary, irrelevant and unfair qualifications, the better it will operate in practice. </para>
          <para>Finally, I want to take the opportunity to ask the Minister to clarify 4 matters which remain uncertain from the Bill and from his second reading speech. Will the Minister elaborate on the answer he provided on the 10th of this month to the following question asked by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman):</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>With reference to the proposed legislation to enable the payment of certain Australian pensions overseas, who are the relevant diplomatic representatives in Canberra with whom he has made contact and from which countries have encouraging replies been received in regard to negotiations for reciprocal arrangements? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Contact has been made with the diplomatic representatives in Canberra of the countries of Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Yugoslavia. </para>
            <para>Encouraging replies have been received in regard to negotiations from the representatives of Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. Representatives of other countries are awaiting instructions from the home Governments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, contact has been established with only 13 countries, so that even if all eventually reply favourably, very great sections of our migrant population could be omitted, even allowing for the fact that reciprocity already exists with the United Kingdom and New Zealand. </para>
          <para>For example, countries not on the Minister&#39;s list, which have provided Australia with  5,000  or more permanent or long term arrivals since  1945  include Belgium,  7,000;  Czechoslovakia,  5,000;  Finland,  13,000;  Hungary,  14,000;  Poland,  22,000;  Sweden,  8.000;  Switzerland,  16,000;  Fiji,  12,000;  Egypt,  30.000:  South Africa,  21,000;  Canada,  46,000;  United States of America,  109,000;  Ceylon,  11,000;  Cyprus,  16,000;  Hong Kong,  25,000;  India,  34,000;  Malaysia,  49.000;  Singapore,  21,000;  China,  17,000;  Indonesia,  12,000;  Israel.  9.000:  Japan,  11,000;  Lebanon,  30,000  and the Philippines,  6,000.  All the figures I have quoted have been taken to the nearest thousand and are derived from the consolidated statistics of the Department of Immigration for  1971. </para>
          <para>What is being done for all these people? It is obvious that many of them come from countries which would never agree to reciprocity. Others come from countries where the social service systems would not meet our standards. Others come from countries that would not be interested in taking the initiative in the matter; that initiative will be left to us, if it is to be taken at all, and surely it is our responsibility to pursue it. It is already clear from representations made in my own electorate that this is a matter of very great concern to many migrants from other than our major migration sources, and  1.  ask the Minister to indicate what action is being taken or is intended to be taken on their behalf. </para>
          <para>Secondly, will the Minister amplify what proposed section  83ab (2.)  is meant to convey. It reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In negotiating an agreement under the last preceding sub-section on behalf of the Commonwealth, the Minister or any other person having the conduct of the negotiations shall have regard to the kinds of pension paid, or to be paid, by the other country to persons who have left that country and are residing in Australia and, in particular, shall have regard to whether those, pensions correspond to the pensions paid, or to be paid, by the Commonwealth to persons who have left Australia and are residing in that other country. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What exactly does that proposed section mean? Does it mean that we will not enter into reciprocal agreements with countries that do not have the equivalent of our widow&#39;s pension, for example, or whose equivalent benefits, where they do exist, are less in money value than our own? In other words, what significance is intended to be attached to phrases like &#39;shall have regard to&#39; and &#39;whether those pensions correspond&#39;? It is apparent that this whole Bill will operate effectively only on a broad enough exercise of discretion and flexibility by the Government. Even accepting that - and I do accept it - some indication of the Government&#39;s present approach to these matters would help us to evaluate better the potential value of the Bill itself. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, I direct the Minister&#39;s attention also to the wording of proposed section  83ac (3),  which does not appear to convey the Government&#39;s own apparent intention in all cases. If I understand the proposal correctly, the Government is intending to say that where, for example, the wife of a pensioner herself reaches pension age while abroad, she should be entitled to transfer to the full rate pension without any special formalities. There is no problem in that. However, if one takes the case where an invalid pensioner dies abroad, leaving a widow and children, the position is rather more obscure. In Australia, subject to means, the widow would then go on to the widow&#39;s pension. However, proposed section  83ac (3.)  (b) provides that where the circumstances set out in one of the paragraphs of the last preceding subsection are applicable in relation to that other pension, the first-mentioned pension may be cancelled, and that other pension may be granted and paid as if he were residing in Australia. </para>
          <para>The relevant paragraph in the preceding sub-section is proposed section  83ac (2.)  (c), which states &#39;the position is a widow&#39;s pension payable by reason of the death of the husband of the pensioner, and that death occurred when both the pensioner and her husband were permanently resident in Australia&#39;. In other words, to deem the wife to have been residing in Australia would appear to be not enough; it would seem to be necessary in addition to deem the husband to have been residing in Australia at the time of his death, and even given the assistance of the Acts Interpretation Act that does not appear to be covered. I suppose I should apologise for the complexity of that question, and I will apologise also in advance if I have misunderstood the section. However, if there are any doubts on this matter, I am sure the Minister would prefer to clarify them now rather than to wait for a hardship case to present them. </para>
          <para>Finally, 1 raise the position of pensioners already abroad who would be entitled to a pension if still residing in Australia. The Bill, as presented, still denies these people any benefit at all unless they go through the formality of returning to Australia to establish their entitlement here. They would then, of course, be free to return again to their present homes overseas. A formality of this kind is expensive, grossly wasteful and, in the case of very elderly persons, perhaps impossible to comply with. Thus, an entirely new set of anomalies could be created, all of them avoidable at very modest cost since the numbers involved, one expects, would be relatively small. I hope that the Minister will accept that these questions are worth attention and an answer. </para>
          <para>As I would no doubt have diverted attention from my basic theme, let me summarise it again in conclusion. Firstly, this Bill is good as far as it goes but, secondly, the amendment, in reducing the residential period to 10 years for an age pension and eliminating the need for reciprocity would make it much better. I commend the amendment to the House. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this Bill, as indicated by the title, is to pay pensions and other benefits to certain persons after they cease to be resident in Australia. It will apply also to people who are Australian born and to those who have settled in Australia. It makes no distinction between new settlers who have taken out Australian citizenship and those who have not. 1 congratulate the Minister upon introducing this legislation, for I know he has been advocating portability of pensions for quite some time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Act prevented many of our aged citizens, who had lived and worked hard in Australia for many years, from drawing pensions because they chose to live in another country. The Bill now before this Parliament will enable the Minister to enter into an agreement with other countries, and pensions will then be paid to Australian citizens who go to reside overseas, whether permanently or temporarily. In return, the participating country will be expected to pay pensions to their former residents now living in Australia. The agreements that the Australian Government enters into with other countries will differ in most cases, so no firm rule will apply. Each agreement will be drawn up in terms of mutual relationship existing between Australia and the participating country, with a view to obtaining the best possible benefit for Australian citizens. </para>
          <para>The agreement will cover age, invalid and widow&#39;s pensions, and the residential qualification for a portable pension will be 20 years after reaching the age of 16. Insofar as invalid pensions are concerned, there is no residential qualification provided the disease or injury was contracted or caused in Australia to a permanent resident. The same conditions will apply in the case of a widow&#39;s pension, when the husband&#39;s death occurs while permanently resident in Australia. Portability will also extend to allowances for pensioners&#39; wives and to the special pension payable for 12 months after the death of a member of a married couple. </para>
          <para>An important aspect of the Bill is that the benefits shall be paid irrespective of whether the person is a naturalised Australian citizen. This is where it disagrees with the views of the Opposition. I know many new settlers in my electorate who have resided there for 15 or 20 years and who have not taken out Australian citizenship for certain reasons. I know these people to be hard working and loyal citizens who are a credit to the community in which they reside. Most of these migrants have come to Australia to seek a new life for their children, as they know that better opportunities exist in Australia, and even though they do not take out Australian citizenship, their children most certainly are Australians, as many have been born here. </para>
          <para>There are other reasons why migrants do not take out Australian citizenship. Many have small families or are single and they feel that one day they may wish to return to their country of birth. So, why should these people, many of whom have spent the best part of their working lives in Australia, not be able to take their pension entitlement with them? This is what this Bill proposes to do. The Bill recently introduced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> would confine the benefits to Australian citizens and this would fail to help those very persons of whom I have just spoken. Such a measure would discriminate against many of our best citizens. As I said, these people are the parents of Australian children. This surely must be a defect in the Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. Under the Bill introduced by the Minister for Social Services every effort will be made to secure the greatest possible reciprocal payment for migrants from other countries who choose to live in Australia. </para>
          <para>In some instances it is possible for migrants from other countries to bring their pensions or portion of their pensions with them. If the Government grants portability of Australian pensions without getting anything in return for our new settlers, as was proposed in the Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, we would leave ourselves open to strong criticism. I am pleased to say that this is not the intention of the Government and the Minister for Social Services will do everything possible to negotiate the best reciprocal payments for new settlers. The Minister, in introducing this Bill, has given an unequivocal assurance that he will negotiate for the best possible agreement between this Government and other governments and I am quite confident that the Minister will press their case to breaking point if necessary. I must hasten to add that this is the least we can do for our new settlers, many of whom make great sacrifices to come here. Many say goodbye to their families and friends and travel thousands of miles to Australia to commence a new life and the least we can do is to negotiate the best possible deal for them. </para>
          <para>Whilst on the subject I think it is a great pity more is not done to make our new settlers welcome, particularly the non English-speaking migrants. Old Australians are a pretty casual lot and little effort is made to seek out new settlers and make them feel that they really belong. The best way to do this is to invite them into our homes for a friendly chat over a cup of tea or something stronger, if necessary. In the postwar period 2.9 million migrants have come to Australia to seek a new way of life and if it were not for the great work force they provide, we would have less of all those things we consider today to be so essential to our way of life. They have also contributed greatly to the cultural and spiritual life of Australia and I feel that a much greater effort should be made by old Australians to make them feel at home. If this were the case perhaps the approximate number of 20,000 migrants, which was referred to this afternoon, would not be returning to their countries of birth. </para>
          <para>To qualify for an Australian pension overseas, recipients must have resided - this point has been subject to a lot of debate this afternoon - for 20 years in Australia, which is less than the qualifying period of 25 years in Canada. This does not, of course, apply to invalid or widows&#39; pensions. In the Bill presented by the Leader of the Opposition it was possible for a citizen from the United Kingdom or New Zealand to live in Australia for 12 months and qualify for the Australian pension on the grounds of age or as an invalid or widow and return to live abroad for the rest of his or her life at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. Such a proposition is absurd. </para>
          <para>Whilst on the subject of portability I want to mention one or two anomalies that apply to elderly migrants who come to Australia from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. As the Channel Islands have no reciprocal agreement with Britain it means that migrants from these islands do not qualify for Australian pensions on arrival. I recently had a case of a widow, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Elsie</inline> Le Mesurier of Noble Park, who came to Australia last year to live with her only son, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reg</inline> Le Mesurier. She was very concerned to learn on arrival that she did not qualify for a supplement to her Channel Islands pension, as that country was not included in the United KingdomAustralia reciprocal agreement. In effect, it means that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Le</inline> Mesurier&#39;s residence in the Channel Islands cannot be treated as residence in Australia, as applies with all other citizens migrating to Australia from the United Kingdom or New Zealand. She will have to complete 10 years continuous residence in Australia before she qualifies for an age pension, or 5 years for a widow&#39;s pension. </para>
          <para>However, it is doubtful whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Le</inline> Mesurier will ever receive an Australian pension unless the Act is amended, as she is over 80 years of age. I know there are other elderly migrants who come to Australia to live with a son or daughter, and who do not qualify for an Australian pension until they have resided here for 10 years, lt is quite obvious that anyone over 80 years of age does not come to Australia just, to receive an Australian pension and then return to his or her country of birth. I would therefore like the Minister to take this matter up with his colleague, the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> and give consideration to amending the Act with a view to paying the Australian pension to all migrants over 80 years of age, after serving a qualifying period of 6 months, as applies to residents from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. At present many of these aged people are a great financial burden on their families because they cannot obtain fringe benefits under the pension scheme. The Act should be amended so that they may qualify for a Commonwealth pension. I would like the Minister to have a good look at the case I have presented. </para>
          <para>Finally, I repeat that the Bill before the House is not confined to migrants only - I have not heard this mentioned this afternoon - as Australian born citizens also will bc able to draw their pensions whilst living overseas. As previously mentioned, the new pensions will apply to all migrants, whether naturalised or not. This legislation is long overdue and I am sure it will be welcomed by all Australian citizens. I wish it a speedy passage through the House. </para>

            <para>- I support the amendment moved and just varied by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> which will now read:  whilst not opposing the provisions  ot  the Bill the House is of opinion that the Bill should  provide  for the continuation of the payment  of  age pensions and other benefits after a period  of 10  years&#39; residence in Australia and irrespective  of  any agreement between Australia and the current place of residence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Whilst this Bill is a definite improvement to some extent, it is nevertheless a sleight of hand as it cannot really be effective unless reciprocal arrangements are made between Australia and the countries of origin of the various migrants. It is hard to understand, therefore, why this is insisted upon because although this legislation may be introduced and become law, it still will not at this point of time give anything to migrants who wish to return to their homelands. Furthermore, the legislation provides only for the payment of such pensions under the reciprocal arrangements or the portability arrangements after a period of 20 years. This in itself is difficult to understand because a migrant is entitled to an age pension after residence in this country for a period of 10 years. After migrants have been here for 10 years they receive their pensions and if they were made available to them under the portability arrangements it still would not cost the Government any more. Under this legislation a migrant who returns to his homeland sometime during a period of residence in Australia of from 10 years to 20 years will actual!) save the Government money by way of pension payments, so surely it would have been a reasonable proposition at this point of time to give to migrants who return to their homeland the same facilities as they receive here in Australia and the facilities which are offered in their homeland. These are important issues at which we need to look. </para>
          <para>I do not intend to speak at any great length. 1 can recall approximately 2 years ago - the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> will remember this - that there was a deputation of migrant people in his office asking for these portability arrangements. At that time the Minister had hoped that some decision would be made by the time the following year&#39;s Budget was presented but this did not occur. I do not necessarily blame the Minister for this. Undoubtedly Treasury leant on him very hard. In fact if there had not been a private members Bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition I do not believe he would have been able to overcome the opposition of Treasury even to this watered down proposal that we now have before us. It is a watered down approach. It does not provide anything in hard cash for any migrant who returns to his or her homeland unless reciprocal arrangements are made between this country and the migrant&#39;s country of origin. In addition, the Bill grants reciprocal arrangements, if they are finally organised only after a period of residence in Australia of 20 years. To have given it for the normal period of 10 years would not have cost the Government any more in hard cash and I find it very difficult to understand why this was not done. For these reasons I support the amendment moved by the Opposition. I think it is common sense. It touches these two issues - that is, to grant a pension after a period of 10 years residence in Australia and to grant it irrespective of any agreement between Australia and the current place of residence - and for those reasons I support the proposed amendment. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support this Bill. At the outset 1 should like to congratulate the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> This legislation is further evidence of his desire to bring about major changes in our welfare system. Not only is he a Minister for Social Services who has great compassion but also he has great mathematical ability to enable him to work out these matters. I wish to discuss 3 issues concerned with this Bill: The concepts behind it, the unrealistic amendment moved by the Opposition and the relative levels of benefits that exist in Australia in comparison with the benefits overseas. As the Minister has made clear, 3 main concepts lie behind this Bill. The first of these is that the benefits should be available to all migrants and persons who fulfil the other prerequisites of the legislation and who come from countries with whom reciprocal arrangements have been concluded. This benefit is available to citizens and non-citizens alike. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this provision. The act of renouncing citizenship of the country of one&#39;s birth is a serious and often traumatic experience and I fully understand the reluctance of many migrants to do so. We are all hopeful that migrants will eventually want to become naturalised citizens and participate fully in our community, but if they for their own good reasons do not wish to relinquish their original citizenship we should not seek to discriminate against them. This is what the Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on 23rd March would have done. By limiting the provisions of his Bill to Australian citizens he invited this national Parliament to discriminate against a large section of our migrant community. Naturally the Government finds it abhorrent and rejects this discriminatory approach. </para>
          <para>The second guiding principle is to ensure that migrants do not lose out on any existing benefits through any unilateral action of the Australian Government. Proposed new sections 83ab and 83ac provide that this Government should enter into negotiations with other interested governments. I know that the Minister already has commenced this process so that reciprocal agreements can be reached. The Government does not want to act in such a way as would cause a migrant in receipt of a pension from, say, Germany to forfeit his entitlement. For instance, at present a German migrant who may be in receipt of a German pension, should he become a naturalised Australian, would forfeit his pension. The intent of the Bill is to provide that in any reciprocal agreement this German migrant could become naturalised without losing his German pension entitlement and, conversely, an Australian who is in receipt of some social service payment who goes to Germany and there becomes a naturalised German citizen would not lose his Australian rights. Such agreements serve to remove nationality as a qualification for entitlement. The Opposition would have us abandon this negotiating position and give away all our cards. Members of the Opposition are great ones for unilateral action whereby we do all the giving for precious little in return with only a minimum consideration for Australia&#39;s best interests - no less in social services than in foreign policy. They invite us once again to become party to the abandonment of the interests of many immigrants. Once again we will have no part of it whatsoever. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the guiding principles of residential requirements. Twenty years is not really such a long time and it could never be disputed that in 20 years a person makes a significant contribution to the community as a whole. I note with interest the Opposition&#39;s retreat on this point. The original Whitlam Bill was so sloppy that, for instance, a British widow could have resided here for a bare 12 months, qualified for an Australian pension and then quit the country taking the pension with her. Now that the error of his ways has been exposed to him by the Minister, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is more contrite and now will settle for a qualification period of 10 years. But even this means that after 10 years&#39; residence a pension is payable. After all that is not long, say, for a young person of the age of 16. He has only to wait until he is 26 to qualify for an Australian pension at some future date and then leave the country. In those 10 years he may well have been in an educational institution for 6 years receiving Commonwealth Government assistance. Therefore, he may have contributed only 4 years of productive work to our community - not a bad deal for him. There would be 4 years of contribution in exchange for an extensive period of benefit. This would be a silly idea and an invitation to plunder the Australian Treasury and to milk the Australian taxpayer. Again, the Government rejects this proposal. Its own proposals are far more realistic and responsible. 1 turn now to say a few words about the value of the Australian pension in comparison with those that pertain in most of our migrant source countries. The Minister has been good enough to supply me with a few figures in this regard. If we simply take the age pension here as $18.25 for the single rate and $32.00 for the married rate - not counting things like supplementary assistance or extensive fringe benefits - and compare it with a few of our migrant source countries we find that we are way ahead. Naturally we are far ahead of countries such as Yugoslavia, which pays $14.90 for both single and married rates; Portugal, $6.62 for both; or Greece, $15.88 and $17.89 respectively. But more to the point, we compare favourably with those countries more akin to Australia in standards of living and earning. The current British rates are $13.15 single and $21.25 married and although some additional means-tested assistance is also available, its pension is treated as part of taxable income. The New Zealand rates are $17.10 single and $31.00 married. Perhaps the most surprising of these international comparisons is with affluent Switzerland where the current rates are $18.14 for the single rate and $29.02 for the married rate. I think this indicates quite clearly that the level of social services in Australia is high by comparison with the levels that apply in countries from which we get our migrants. As such, our social services may, in fact, be one of the things that will serve to attract migrants to Australia. If this is so, it further reinforces the Government&#39;s stand on the length of residence to qualify for payment. Similarly, I might mention also that any migrants who return home with their Australian pension at the latter part of their lives, living in some comfort on those payments, will in turn be very great ambassadors for Australia among their fellow countrymen. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister first announced this measure at the end of January and the Minister subsequently has amplified some of that announcement. He said that he hoped that negotiations could be concluded as soon as possible - I believe he mentioned the end of this financial year as his target. If I remember correctly he announced in February that preliminary talks had been opened with 13 countries. I am sure that all honourable members want to see these talks concluded with a minimum of delay so that this scheme can come into operation. The Prime Minister&#39;s original announcement was to the effect that this proposal was an outgrowth from a detailed interdepartmental committee. This is yet further evidence of the very real concern that this Government shows for all aspects of migrant welfare. Honourable members on this side of the House see Australia&#39;s migrants as people with special interests that deserve our protection. Already I have mentioned to the House, as the Minister did some time ago, the ways in which the Opposition - in both its Leader&#39;s abortive Bill and now in its equally abortive amendments - has betrayed the real interest of the migrant community. This results from the fact that the Government treats migrants as individuals deserving to be treated as such whereas the Opposition sees them merely in terms of votes to be used for its own political advantage. What other explanation is there for the way in which the interests of the migrants have been so shamefully relegated to oblivion by the Australian Labor Party? (Quorum formed). </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I want to state once again that this Bill represents a remarkable advance in terms both of our national social welfare system and in the special regard which we pay to the interests of our migrants. I congratulate the Minister on his efforts in this regard. I am proud to be associated with the measure, and I give it my fullest support. I oppose the amendment which has been introduced in a shallow way. It contains the words &#39;whilst not opposing the Bill&#39;. Why are honourable members opposite not game enough to come out and oppose the Bill? If they had done that they would have revealed the old attitude which they adopt to migrants. </para>

            <para>- The only reference I shall make to the speech which the honourable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Irwin)</inline> has just made to the House is to point out one glorious inconsistency. In the course of his remarks he said that 20 years was not too long for a migrant to wait to receive a pension. I point out that the honourable member has to wait only 8 years to receive his parliamentary pension, and he can take it where he will. This is the exact position that we take on this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a very simple proposition before the Parliament, and it is that an Australian citizen should be able to take his pension with him wherever he might go. The idea is that this pension is his right; it is not his privilege. This is the simple proposition that we put forward not only on behalf of the people who come to Australia but for all Australians. Even the honourable member for Mitchell may want to flee his electorate perhaps sooner than he has planned, and if he wishes we will be glad to see that not only his parliamentary pension, after 8 years, is paid to him, but also, if there are any other pensions due to him, that they are paid to him, and there is nothing wrong with that as a proposition. As a matter of fact, this is the proposition that we are putting before the Parliament at the present time. </para>
          <para>The Government has been less than just to many of the migrants who have come here since the war. After all, this nation needed migrants, lt wanted them to come, it encouraged them to come, and it has reaped the benefit of the labour of 2.5 million new people. At the same time, the Government has practised - I think this should be said on this occasion - a whole range of discriminations which I find offensive and unjust, and this matter of pensions is only one of them. The Government has tended to take a man from the bosom of his family and encourage him to come and work here. The categories for which entry was encouraged were all right. A man was encouraged to come here if he was in those categories. But it was 20 years before the Government recognised the basic humanity of facilitating family reunions. Tens of thousands of migrants went into deep debt to bring even their wives and children to join them. They paid 20 per cent and 30 per cent interest on loans to bring their families with them, while some favoured categories of migrants could hop on a plane and come here with ease and maximum help. </para>
          <para>We have drawn migrants from 50 countries, and there is a great range of discrimination practised between all of them. Even today, those of us who have been concerned with migrant welfare and have achieved some assistance for family reunions, find that there is discrimination continuing in the matter of the issue of visas. If a mother or a grandmother of a migrant wants to come and visit her family, in some cases it can take anything up to 6 months to clear her through all the long drawn out procedures. Of course, in other cases there is no trouble at all, and this constitutes discrimination. I submit that this Bill follows the 20-year-old pattern of discrimination between one migrant and another which has been practised by the Government. </para>
          <para>There is much talk in Australia of cutting down migration, of discouraging new settlement here. If the Government wants to discourage migration, all it has to do is to continue to practise some of the discrimination that it is practising at the present time. &#93; submit that the Government has  not  kept pace with the good will and unifying influence of the Australian people generally who have held out a helping hand and a welcoming hand to migrants. Certainly the Government has lagged behind the generosity of the people generally  in  this regard. In fact, 1 think  most  Australians would be shocked to find that distinctions are made between one category of migrant and another. I shall just quote in passing one example which concerns the  matter  of income tax. If a man settles in the Federal Republic  of  Germany, Canada or the United States  of  America and he has to maintain the members of his family in his country of birth, he can do this and claim income tax deductions. There is a facility to help members of his family. Surely this is something about which we should be concerned. </para>
          <para>I submit again that the Federal Government by its attitude to pensions, is perpetuating undesirable divisions in the community. Indeed, the Government&#39;s present proposals will do more than that. They will create more divisions and more categories of citizens. The burden of the Opposition&#39;s proposition is that there should be no divisions and no distinctions and that we should recognise that a  pension  is a right and not a privilege. Of course, the Government&#39;s attitude is  in  contrast. Let us look at the divisions created by this legislation. For some years the Government has applied the rule that Australians, whether they are native born or naturalised, should have 10 years&#39; residence in Australia before they qualify for a pension. As a result of bilateral agreements with only 2 governments it has been possible for former United Kingdom and New Zealand citizens to take their pensions back to retirement in their own countries if they so desire, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. The principle has been established for 2 categories of migrants. What the Government now proposes will create greater hardships for Australians as well as for </para>
          <para class="block">United Kingdom and New Zealand citizens, because they will have to wait 20 years before they receive a pension. </para>
          <para>Let us see what this proposed 20 year limit means. It certainly will create great hardships for people who, after the middle of their lives, come to Australia for many reasons. Very often they come to join the younger members of the family who are here. They come here, very properly, and they are welcomed by the Australian people. Surely 20 years is not to be considered a reasonable period. I know it has been said that the Government in its generosity - perhaps next year - will look at this matter, but surely the principle should be accepted now. Why postpone it? If there are any doubts in the Government&#39;s mind why can they not be resolved now? 1 know that the Government has made gestures, but surely that is not adequate at the present time, because if we are to change anything that is on the statute book it means that we have to come back to Parliament and make the change here. </para>
          <para>The Government has made it clear that pension portability will depend upon negotiated agreements with other countries. So even this 20 year residence scheme depends on the Government negotiating with, presumably, up to 50 countries or 50 areas. I am not quite sure what happens when the Government cannot reach agreement with the country of origin of the migrant because, perhaps, the country no longer exists. This is a real consideration. In any case, as has been pointed out by my colleagues who spoke earlier, the very passing of this legislation does not mean that there will be portability of pensions. They still have to be negotiated country by country, and this could take a very long time. Where there are no countries of origin, the migrant just is not covered. According to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> the discussions leading to the adoption of the 20-year residence scheme have been continuing for 5 years. This is the end result after 5 years. The Government is proceeding at a snail&#39;s pace to recognise a very simple and fundamental right that is recognised by other countries. So we have this situation of delay and inadequacy at the present time. </para>
          <para>I shall now point to some of the further divisions. In the 20 years residence scheme there will be a series of major divisions, and let me point them out to the Minister. An Australian born citizen at 65 years of age can go to his home town, and enjoy his pension, fie can also live abroad for as long as he likes, just so long as he goes to only 2 countries - the United Kingdom or New Zealand. There is a second category of migrants - the migrants from the United Kingdom and New Zealand who can return to their home towns with a pension. This is very desirable, too. Then there is a third category - the migrants from all other countries with whom reciprocity agreements have been concluded. They will have the right to wait 20 years to receive a pension. Ff one of these migrants is 55 years old when he arrives in Australia, it means that at 75 years of age he will be able to take his pension and go to his home town in his country of origin. That is the third category. The fourth category include migrants who come from a country which probably no longer exists or which, for one reason or another wish to sign a treaty of reciprocity. In this case there is no portability. So none of the rights no matter how limited enjoyed by those in the first 3 categories are enjoyed by those in the fourth category. Surely this is divisive and is divisiveness which is undesirable as between one Australian citizen and another. We have divisions now in the community, but we are going to increase the number of divisions. If we have this sort of situation, obviously it will create tensions in areas in which there need not be tension. </para>
          <para>We already have divisions between one citizen and another. If I may mention one in passing, even an Australian citizen who has been naturalised can be deported from his own country - that is, Australia - if it is the wish of the Government to do so. This is a provision which is retained in the legislation and which the Opposition has opposed for a very long time, lt is not good to have a law which does not apply equally between citizens. This is the situation that we have at the present time in many respects. I submit that the measure before the House is an inadequate one. It is a divisive measure. The signing of treaties of reciprocity is going to be a very interesting exercise because all nations which will be concerned have different levels of social services and have different qualifying periods to entitle a person for benefits. I am not sure how we can have reciprocity when there are entirely different qualifying periods. For example, after contributing for 5 years to the national health scheme a male Maltese citizen qualifies for a pension at 61 years of age. In Italy it is a 15-year qualification period. In other countries it is 10 years. This makes the Government&#39;s approach to writing of treaties of reciprocity much more difficult. </para>
          <para>I am not altogether sure what the philosophy is in making these distinctions. I cannot understand why we should be asked to accept a divisive philosophy in this matter. The German citizen who becomes an Australian loses all his rights in Germany. He loses everything. This has been one of the greatest worries. A year ago 1 received from Germany the text of a treaty which had been resolved between the Dominion of Canada and Germany. A convention on social security which was made between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain came into force 10 years ago. lt seems extraordinary to me that the British and Germans, who 27 years ago were at war, got together 10 years ago on reciprocity without any great difficulty or delay, yet it has taken us twice the time to come up with a less sound proposition. </para>
          <para>I do not think there is much merit in what we have been able to do here. The West German Government has sought an agreement, f know from my own knowledge that since July 1969 it has very actively sought this agreement because of the position in which former German citizens were placed. I again say to the House that after pursuing a migration programme for 25 years we still have this discrimination in pensions. We have discrimination in conditions of settlement. We have discrimination even in naturalisation, which is undesirable, ft may be said that the law has not been invoked. All I want to say is that it is not enough to have a big stick in the cupboard and to say: &#39;I do not use it.&#39; If it is there and it is legal and proper to use it, then obviously it is a continuing threat. 1 want to say also that in contrast to this measure, other measures that have been enacted by other countries which are actively seeking migrants have been so much more generous. I do not suggest that the Minister for Social Services has set his heart against any improvement in this measure. I sympathise with him in many ways because I believe that if he were a free agent he would probably have agreed with the Opposition and said to the House: &#39;The pension is a right, let us have it as a right and let us have no more nonsense to drag out long debates on technicalities.&#39; In fact this Bill is the result of a decision by the Government and a decision by the Cabinet. 1 cannot understand how they reached it. I find it regrettable that they have done so. I feel that it would be far better for them to have second thoughts and to say: &#39;Let us have an Australian pension for Australian citizens and Australian residents as a right that they may take with them wherever they desire to go in their retirement.&#39; I hope that this proposition will be adopted with unanimity by this Parliament, if not now, then, I hope to goodness, in the near future. </para>

            <para>-  As I have already spoken to the Deputy Government Whip in regard to the time remaining in which to dispose of Government Business I shall make my comments very much to the point. After listening to speeches from members of the Opposition in this debate this afternoon I have reflected on the subjects which they chose to use by way of comparison. Some chose Canada as a country for comparison and others chose other countries just to bolster their stories. Honourable members opposite seem to choose these various countries at various times in making comparisons simply to try to make Australia look worse than other countries. I am sure that if our performances in all fields were to be compared with the various aspects of government in other countries, our country would line up quite well. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Berinson)</inline> spoke this afternoon in the debate and said he supported the proposition. He showed more sense than did most honourable members opposite who spoke in this debate. The speech made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> was possibly one of his worst performances ever. The fact that this afternoon - only a short time ago - he came into the House and altered the terms of his amendment because certain things have been said which showed the original amendment to be unsatisfactory further underlines the fact that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject is far from satisfactory. There are one or two points that I wish to make quickly. </para>

          <para>As I was saying before the mountain erupted, the Australian Labor Party&#39;s amendment suggests that every migrant who comes to Australia should be naturalised before he qualifies for an age pension and that after only 10 years in Australia he should be allowed to leave the country and take his pension with him. I suggest that by the imposition of a naturalisation requirement the Leader of the Opposition is putting a price on Australian nationality - $17 a week, the amount of the present age pension. I know families who have come to this country, the husband of which has decided to become naturalised, but for her own private reasons the wife has been reluctant to do so too quickly, and sometimes many years have passed before she has become naturalised. The Australian Labor Party is suggesting by its amendment that any person who does not choose to become a naturalised Australian should be ineligible for an age pension, a widow&#39;s pension or any other pension. As I said before this is discrimination in its worst form, that we in Australia would be sitting in judgment on the private motives of those who may or may not choose to become naturalised. </para>
          <para>Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition made a great deal of fuss about our migration policies and the state of the economy in this country being such that we were no longer attracting migrants. J draw to the House&#39;s attention Labor Party policy on this question. The Leader of the Opposition has been reported as saying that under Labor &#39;fewer migrants will come to Australia&#39;. The Leader of the Opposition, who would like to be the nation&#39;s Prime Minister, seems to pick up arguments and use them just to suit the discussion of the day. On many occasions in the last couple of years he has said that we must cut migration back. The Government has cut our migrant intake back from 180.000 to 140,000 a year. But now because it is opportune to do so he has cited what the Government has set out purposely to do as an example of why this country is no longer attracting migrants. This is a very unworthy and unfair approach by the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed he certainly sells his country short as does no other man that I have seen in this House. I could say much more, because I have many thousands of migrants, including naturalised migrants, in my electorate, but because it is intended to pass this Bill before dinner I will now allow the Minister to conclude the debate. </para>

            <para>1 have very limited time. Let me point out the differences between the Australian pension system and other systems which seem to me to be significant. Firstly, our system is non-contributory. Secondly, it is non-graduated. The pension is paid either wholly or not at all, whereas in other countries it is graduated according to the length of contribution. The Australian pension is a good bit higher than most of the corresponding pensions in other countries, and we do not require a migrant to be naturalised to be eligible. The 2 matters of difference between the Government&#39;s Bill and the Opposition&#39;s amendment relate to the period of residence which enables a migrant to become eligible for portability rights and to reciprocal agreements on pensions with other countries. Let me deal with each of those very briefly. The requirement of 20 years to become eligible for a portable pension is in the Government&#39;s Bill not to deal with any people who are now in Australia but to prevent the possibility of people coming deliberately to Australia to qualify for a pension, take it away and fleece the Australian taxpayer - which is all of us. This is something which is completely undesirable. Under the Opposition&#39;s amendment, much less the inept and sloppy Bill which to his shame the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> produced, it would be possible for a group of British widows - thousands of them - to come here, reside in Australia for one year only, return home and live outside Australia with a permanent pension. This is the kind of thing which is inherent in the Opposition&#39;s proposals. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is. The honourable member did not understand that it was in the Opposition&#39;s proposals, and it was in the very sloppy and silly Bill which the Leader of the Opposition produced in this House. It seems to me that the provision in the Government&#39;s Bill meets all the proper cases because we are thinking of people who have come here and have by their skill and industry added to the prosperity of the Australian community. That is why they should be able to take a pension abroad. It is true that we have a shorter qualifying period of 10 years, whether it be for any migrant or an Australian, but this is because we do not want to have elderly people in Australia living under bad conditions. But why should the Australian taxpayer be called upon to bear a permanent burden for those who have not contributed significantly to the prosperity of Australia? We are concerned particularly with those who might come to Australia deliberately to qualify for a pension, not with the people who are in Australia now. The Leader of the Opposition said a moment ago that some people in European countries habitually went away and worked for 10 years in another country and then came home. I know that there are such people. If they come to Australia, under the terms of this Bill they would be able subsequently to qualify for an Australian pension at the cost of the Australian taxpayer. We do not intend that the Treasury should be plundered in this way by people who are not at present in Australia and who would come here for the purpose of plundering it. </para>

          <para>The Opposition has some fantastic notion that it will take a long time to make agreements with other countries because they  would require changing of the laws of other countries. May I assure the House that we will not be holding up agreements for any changes in the laws of other countries. We are proposing at this stage to codify what information exists, set it down on paper, and make the agreements swiftly. Already I have been talking to the Ambassadors of Austria, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Malta, Turkey, Ireland, Italy, Yugoslavia and the United States of America. I have appointments with other ambassadors. In point of fact I had one this afternoon which had to be deferred because I had to be in the House for the debate on this Bill. These agreements will be pursued. They will not be lengthy. The Opposition is entirely wrong when it says that these agreements will not come into being for some time. I can assure the Opposition that just the opposite is true. </para>

        <para class="block">The Bill provides for the continuation of the payment of pensions and other benefits to certain persons after they cease to be resident in Australia. As I said on the second reading, the Australian Labor Party finds 2 major faults in the Bill. The first is that persons who are entitled to pensions in Australia will not be able to receive those pensions after they cease to be resident in Australia unless there is a reciprocal agreement between Australia and the country where they go to reside. The other great fault is that, whereas people are entitled to age pensions in Australia after they have lived in Australia for 10 years, they will under this Bill not be able to receive age pensions if they go to live in another country unless they have already lived in Australia for 20 years. In other words, this Bill restores the 20 years residence qualification for age pensions which, at the Labor Party&#39;s instigation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> as he then was, reduced to 10 years in 1962. A McMahon residence test is being introduced into our social services legislation in this Bill, in the same way as a McMahon means test was introduced into the legislation after the last Budget. </para>
        <para>The particular clause to which the Labor Party objects states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A pension shall not continue  to  be paid to  a  person . . . unless ... the pensioner,  after  having attained  the age of 16 years, has  resided in Australia for a period of, or for periods amounting in the aggregate to, not less than 20 years. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If my motion to postpone the whole of this clause is carried the Government will have received the message that that qualifying period of residence for age pensioners should be reduced to 10 years, which it has been for everybody seeking or receiving an age pension who is resident in Australia. I anticipate an argument which will be made, that to reduce the qualifying period of residence from 20 years to 10 years for people living outside Australia will impose a burden on the Budget and that this will cost the country a great deal of money. I will refute this argument by 2 answers which the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> has given to questions I have placed on the notice paper. On 13th October last year I asked him: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>What is the estimated additional annual com of paying age, invalid and widows&#39; pensions and sickness benefits to persons who have qualified for them in Australia but who go to live in foreign countries? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">On 1 0th November the Minister replied: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The information necessary lo enable a reliable estimate to be prepared is not readily available. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Again, after the Minister gave notice of the present Bill on 21st March, 1 asked upon notice: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>What is the estimated additional annual cost of paying pensions and other benefits to certain persons after they cease to be residents in Australia as proposed in the Bill of which he gave notice on 21st March 1972? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Minister replied: lt is not possible to determine the additional cost of paying Australian age, invalid and widows&#39; pensions and other benefits overseas under the arrangements proposed in the Bill introduced into the House on 13th April 1972 - </para>
        <para>It is clear then that the Minister is unable to say what would be the cost of the Labor Party&#39;s Bill, of which I gave no: ice last December and moved the second reading last March, which would have given portability of pensions to anybody who had earnt a pension in Australia and went to live overseas, irrespective of the existence of a reciprocal agreement with the country where he was now living. Also, the Minister is unable to give the cost of the social services provided in the present Bill. For reasons which I need not repeat now, it is quite clear that the Australian community pays less for people who receive their pensions overseas than it inevitably has to spend on them from Federal, State and municipal sources if they continue to live in Australia. In material terms, the community is not out of pocket if people who have earnt pensions choose to receive them overseas. There can be no objection, therefore, to reducing the period for receiving age pensions overseas to 10 years residence instead of 20 years residence, because it will not cost the Australian taxpayer and the Australian community another cent. </para>
        <para>The other objection which will inevitably be made - it is an automatic objection whenever we adopt the procedure of moving that a clause be adjourned - is that we are postponing benefits for other people. In other words, it is suggested that by postponing benefits for one day we are somehow harming those people who will get the benefits 10 years earlier. If the House carries this motion and thereby instructs the Government to restore the Menzies residence qualification, to delete the McMahon residence qualification - to have a 10 year period of residence instead of a 20-year period of residence for everybody who has earnt a pension in Australia wherever he chooses to receive it - people will receive pensions earlier. Nobody will be harmed in that process. As I pointed out earlier, about 90 per cent or more of the migrants from the counties in western Europe which the Minister has designated as countries with which reciprocal agreements are now being sought have lived in Australia for less than 20 years. By reducing the required period of residence in Australia to 10 years there will be a very great increase in the number of people who will be entitled to receive pensions overseas forthwith. </para>
        <para>According to the figures that I quoted for the first time today in the second reading debate on this Bill, the migrants who have been in Australia for more than 20 years are, in 90 per cent or 95 per cent of cases, from eastern European countries - the countries which the Minister has not approached to arrange reciprocal agreements. Accordingly, although they have resided in Australia for 20 years they are disqualified on another ground - that they can receive the benefit of pensions to which they are entitled in Australia if they go to live overseas only if the country to which they go is one with which in the sweet by and by some reciprocal agreement will be achieved. So 1 put the proposition to honourable members that they should postpone this clause as an indication to the Government that it should apply the same qualifying period of residence to those who have age pensions in Australia and also those who wish to receive age pensions even though they go to live in other countries. </para>

          <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has really excelled himself in this matter. First, he brought forward an absolute botch of a Bill, and then he brought forward an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill so badly drawn that he had to get leave to amend it; that is rather a humiliating position for a lawyer to find himself in. Now he has brought forward an amendment that not only exhibits a complete misunderstanding of the whole position but also has an effect quite different from that for which he himself apparently is contending. I find it rather laughable that the Leader of the Opposition should try to draw credit to his Party for the reduction years ago of the period of qualification for an age pension to 10 years. This would be impertinent if it were not absurd. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>However, I will not labour that. What I would rather do is remind the Leader of the Opposition of the fact that the importance of a limit here has nothing to do really with people who live in Australia. What it is aimed at is the prevention of an abuse of the available facilities by persons who at present live outside Australia but might come to Australia in order to take advantage of a loophole in the law. We do not intend to leave the kind of loophole in the law that would enable people from overseas to come here and plunder Australia - and as I understand the position, the Opposition is inclined to take a strong view about people coming to Australia from overseas. If we allow people - for example, as the Leader of the Opposition wants to do - to come to Australia for 8 or 9 years while they are being educated or while they are having their working holiday, and then at some time later they become entitled to a full Australian pension which they can just take overseas, they will go away and laugh at us. That is not the Government&#39;s idea of a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer. There is to be no taking away of any existing right. </para>
        <para>The Opposition talks nonsense about a new residence test. The residence test of 10 years remains exactly as it has been for pensions in Australia. I repeat, there is to be no change at all. What is proposed to be provided is a new concession - absolutely new - rightly restricted to those people who have lived in Australia long enough to make a real contribution to the wealth and productivity of the nation. I know that it is easy to go cheap cheer chasing, as some members of the Opposition are wont to do. It is easy indeed. However, this Government does have some kind of regard for the real interests of the Australian people. We are, after all, an Australian government, and we are here to protect the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Sturt is not as bad tonight as usual. This Bill is designed to treat fairly those people, whether they be Australians or citizens of another country, who have lived in Australia for a great part of their working lives and have really contributed to the wealth and prosperity of the country. The Government is not here to allow persons to come to Australia merely for the purpose of qualifying for a pension. </para>

            <para>- I hear the characteristic interjections from the Opposition, and I know exactly what they mean because the Opposition has been found out. The original Bill brought down by the Leader of the Opposition, which I call a botch of a Bill, would have allowed people from the United Kingdom or from New Zealand to live in Australia for one year only before qualifying to take a permanent pension back to their own countries. That kind of thing shows the absurdity and the lack of any real analysis by the Opposition of the points at issue. I am not going to labour this. 1 simply say that in the argument he addressed to the Committee a few moments ago the Leader of the Opposition showed that he did not understand the real point at issue. Let me make one other observation in that regard. The Leader of the Opposition said that it does not matter if we postpone this Bill because that will not hurt anybody. He knows as well as I do that we are reaching the end of a parliamentary session and that with the postponement of this clause the Bill will not go through and become law, passing this House, going to the Senate and ultimately gaining royal assent, before the beginning of the Budget session. That means that for some months there will be no payments. He knows also that I am in negotiation with a number of other countries and that agreements, some of which may well be concluded before that time, cannot be brought to finality before the Bill passes through Parliament and receives royal assent. The clause that the Leader of the Opposition is moving be postponed is virtually the whole of the Bill, as the honourable members will see. What the Leader of the Opposition is saying is that this Bill should not become operative and that the right of people to have Australian pensions paid overseas should be postponed for 2, 3 or 4 months. </para>

        <para>The Leader of the Opposition does not understand the position, for a moment ago he said: &#39;Look, it is only a matter of a day or two and something is going to happen that will be effective in 10 years time&#39;. That is arrant nonsense and I am surprised that a man who pretends to be a lawyer, who should have read the Bill - and I doubt whether he has - has not understood what is involved in the whole matter. I think that if the Leader of the Opposition had considered it for a moment, he would not have spoken as he did, for what he said was not only a bad argument but also was entirely at variance with the facts. I know that we have to get the Bill through. I know that it has to go to the Senate. ThereforeI move: </para>

I know that there is a great deal of unfinished business - shipbuilding, wool and takeovers - which the Parliament should discuss and which it could not discuss if it went into recess tonight.

            <para>- The House will in fact be coming back next Tuesday. I hope that the Minister will be in a serene enough state of mind to be here when it sits. May I conclude not only by thanking the Minister for at last doing something about this matter, which has been the policy of the Labor Party for the last seven years, but also by paying a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> whom the Minister for Social Services unjustly derided a few minutes ago. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> as he still was, in 1962 who reduced at Labor Party instigation the qualifying period of residence for age pensions from 20 to 10 years. 1 will quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> said in his policy speech in 1961. He said:  it is felt by elderly migrants who have worked and paid taxes in Australia for long periods . . . that it is unreasonable that they should not qualify for age pension. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">He therefore agreed with the Australian Labor Party that the qualifying period should be 10 years residence instead of 20 years. I know that there are few members of the Liberal Party now who are prepared to acknowledge the services to this country, including services in matters of welfare, of their last successful leader. I at least am prepared to acknowledge this country&#39;s debt to him in his age and generation. </para>

I said it would shortly be concluding. So he should get that one accurate. The second point 1 wish to raise is that the reason he gave for this Bill being called Social Services Bill (No. 3) and not (No. 2) is entirely wrong. It is called (No. 3) because Social Services Bill (No. 2) was the one which increased pensions.  His  own Bill - that botch of a Bill - as is only right, has been swept unnamed and unnumbered into limbo. It has been a bad day for the Leader of the Opposition. He should get his facts right. As a lawyer he should not commit these egregious errors. </para>

          <para>-I can assure the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> that the reasons I gave him for this Bill being called Social Services Bill (No. 3) instead of (No. 2) were correct and that his memory, perhaps, or his knowledge of the facts is wrong. While on my feet I wish to correct another of his errors. He quoted quite correctly from the policy speech made in 1961 by the then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies.</inline> But he then added his own words, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> said that because of advocacy of this policy by the Australian Labor Party. Of course that was not the reason. It was said at that time for the reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, gave. I do not think we need waste any more time on the question of the title of this Bill. </para>

The question whether it was the policy of the Australian Labor Party before or after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> made that statement is a matter of debate and to that degree there was no misrepresentation. </para>

            <para>- I know this is a small point but the Minister has re-asserted an inaccuracy. I can very quickly demonstrate it from the documents produced to me just now by the  Clerk.  It will be seen from today&#39;s notice paper that the second reading on Social Services Bill (No. 3) was on 13th April and that Social Services Bill (No. 2) has been on the notice paper in my name since 23rd March. The Minister introduced the (No. 2) Bill and it had its first reading on 19th April, 6 days after Bill (No. 3) was introduced. So what I said was accurate. I am quoting now from documents which the  Clerk  at my request has produced to me. </para>

        <para class="block">The Tariff Proposals which  1  have just tabled introduce changes to the Excise Tariff and Customs Tariff in respect of duties on wine. The changes operate from tomorrow. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the Government announced that it was proposed that an independent inquiry of a factual nature would be conducted into various matters relating to the wine industry. Consequently Professor J. McB. Grant, Professor of Applied Economics at the University of Tasmania, was appointed to conduct the inquiry. </para>
        <para>Professor Grant&#39;s report on the matters referred to him has now been considered by the Government and a decision has been taken to reduce the excise duty on wine by 25c per gallon. </para>
        <para>This decrease in wine excise will mean a reduction in revenue of approximately $500,000 this financial year and some $7m in a full year. The Customs Tariff proposals which I have tabled effect a complementary reduction in the duties on imported wine. 1 understand that my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> will be releasing a Press statement which will elaborate upon the Government&#39;s consideration of Professor Grant&#39;s report.

Customarily the proposals are always introduced in this form and tradition has it - I think the honourable member opposite will know this - that such proposals are either accepted or rejected. Normally, of course, they are accepted. Of course, at a later point of time a validating or an amending Bill is introduced into the House to validate the particular proposals that have been submitted. That is the occasion on which the debate can take place or on which any vote may be taken in relation to the validation of the proposals. </para>

I might recall, at this hour, that the Government supporters and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> particularly, rejected the suggestion that the wine excise should be dealt with in this House at all today. They indicated, in fact, that it should not be dealt with, that it was irresponsible of the Opposition to have even raised it today and I suffered a considerable amount of personal abuse for my effrontery in trying to raise the matter of the excise, and this is continuing in the House at this time. I was told that I should be patient and that the Government in its wisdom and in its own time would deal with it. Now we have an extraordinary somersault. The extraordinary somersault brings the Minister into the House tonight a few hours later with an amendment which says, in effect, that the excise shall be reduced by half - from 50c to 25c. I might say also in relation to the statement made by the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> that his colleague the Minister for Primary Industry would be making a statement outside the House, that there has been a prostitution of the procedures of the Parliament by virtue of the fact that a statement was issued to the Press Gallery a 5 o&#39;clock by a Government backbench member which dealt with his comments on the Minister&#39;s statement before it had been before the House.

I might say that it compounds the felony to which I referred, because the statements have been made in advance of the issue of any statements at all and that seems to me far worse than the matter to which I was referring. However, to come back to the exact matter at issue, we have a situation where the Minister has indicated that the wine excise will be cut from 50c to 25c. The reaction by the industry to this proposal when it was put by the Government some time ago and when it was widely reported was that this was not adequate - that this just would not do the job. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to have the honourable member for Angas interrupt again, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> 1 think that he had a pretty fair go earlier in as much as he had access to the statement before it even came before the House. The situation is that the Australian Wine Board made it quite plain and clear that the 50c excise was a damaging tax that should not be, in fact, imposed. We have the situation where the Federal Council of the Grape Growers Association of Australia expressed itself repeatedly on this subject. We also had the warning of officers of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics - the Government&#39;s own expert body - that this tax should not have been applied. This has been said and it has been published, lt has not been challenged by anyone in the technical sphere. So what has happened? The honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> also has been interested in this matter. He enthusiastically has supported the removal of the excise. What concerns me is the whole way in which this matter has been handled. We had a situation where, as a result of industry representations, the Government set up an interdepartmental committee of inquiry. It completed a report. </para>

I understand that the question is being put, but the question on what - the amendment or the motion? </para>

            <para>- That is right. Let me put this matter in its correct perspective: When the honourable member for Riverina started to speak he first foreshadowed his amendment and moved his amendment. Later, for the benefit of the Minister for Customs and Excise, the honourable member for Riverina again read the amendment. The honourable member for Dawson came to me and asked me was a seconder necessary. I said: &#39;Not at this stage&#39;. That is correct. A seconder was not necessary at that stage - only after the honourable member for Riverina had spoken. I always ask for a seconder after the honourable member who moves an amendment has spoken. </para>

            <para>- It is very easy to criticise a  chairman.  It is not so easy to be up there in the chair, trying to control 125 members, each of whom is trying to tear the  chairman  down. I am serious in this. I have been  chairman  of pretty tough meetings, but 1 have never struck one as tough as this one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> wilh due respect, 1 do not think what has happened is your fault at all; it is the fault of the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>

            <para>- All right. I will not blame the Minister but I will just say this: It is so grossly unfair for the Parliament to have a situation in which, when somebody tries to move an amendment, you stop a vote on the amendment simply by moving that the question be put before the amendment can be seconded. It is quite unjust and unfair, and I would suggest that the Minister should be big enough - even if we vote on the thing straight away- </para>

I appreciate the fact that he is having some remorse of conscience at this time. After all, we have the situation of a great indus-&#39; try that is in trouble for one principal, reason. The objections and interjections coming from the Government side indicate that honourable members opposite are not interested in the reasons or in the industry.&#39; I do not know which it is, but I would suggest that this is a major industry that was proceeding very successfully without any need for help; for that matter, it did not want any hindrance either from the Government. Then suddenly we have a decision from the Government to impose an excise which was against the best advice of the Government&#39;s own advisers, and it was against the advice of the industry itself. I am suggesting that this has been the position from the very time when the excise was first mooted. As 1 said before, the advice that was given to the Government covered the situation well. The Government was told: Mf you put this excise on, the rate of expansion of the industry will slow down almost to zero&#39;. </para>

        <para>Today has been an extraordinary day. We had the spectacle of the Government standing on its head to drink the grapes of wrath because presumably it has 11 supporters who are in some jeopardy in their seats because of the stupidity of the actions of the Government itself. I say this with some bitterness. </para>

            <para>- When the conscience is flicked it is incredible what it will bring out. We have seen the performance today and the partial success of the industry&#39;s efforts, supported by the Opposition. But what 1, on behalf of the Opposition, say in this amendment is that the Government has not done what the industry has told the Government it wants, that is, to remove the excise. We have said this consistently, and I might say that honourable members on this side of the House have given specific and individual pledges to the industry that they will work untiringly until the excise is lifted. We are honouring our obligations, we are honouring our pledges, which is more than can be said for the Minister for Primary Industry or, in fact, for the people who sit behind him because they have not given due consideration to the difficulties that the industry has been facing. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I come back to what I said when I began that the Opposition has been totally consistent in this matter and that we are consistent at this stage. The remarkable somersault by the Government today is an indication of the fact that the campaign waged by the industry with the support of the Opposition has had partial success. We would hope that even at this eleventh hour the Government would think again, do what the industry requires of it and recognise that, by taking this revenue of $4m to $5m, homes, towns and communities will be placed in difficulties unnecessarily. I suggest that this is the motivation behind the amendment which the honourable member for Sturt will second. </para>

            <para>- I understand that a copy is already with the  Clerk.  Approximately 9 hours ago this House was dealing with a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose of initiating a debate on the imposition of the wine tax by this Government upon the wine industry. Since the wine tax was imposed inquir ies have been made by this Government. This Government is prone to setting up some form of inquiry or with monotonous regularity establishing a committee whenever feeling is against some form of taxation or legislation introduced by this Government. The Government did not need a committee of inquiry to tell it that it should impose this tax on a rural industry which seems to be successful and which was showing some form of annual growth rate before the imposition of this tax. The Government has stooped to all sorts of subterfuges, one of which was to make inquiries. This was the pattern under the previous Prime Minister, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> the previous Minister for Primary Industry and the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in regard to this type of tax. How much was involved in terms of the cost of the inquiries? Perhaps it may be said that the Government is spending $7m to save itself or to attempt to save itself. </para>

        <para>It is of no use the Government saying tonight that it is prepared to introduce into this House measures to reduce the tax by about 50 per cent. As the Federal member for the electorate of Sturt, an area in which a large percentage of Australia&#39;s wine is produced, I have been associated with the wine industry and I have attended meetings relating to the imposition of this tax by this Government. I have attended meetings at which the Minister for Primary Industry has been in attendance. He is now sitting at the table chatting with the honourable member for Angus <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles).</inline> At these meetings in areas where grape juice is produced attacks have been made on the Labor Party and the honourable member for Angas has in fact said that if the Opposition were prepared to stand up in this House and move a motion for the abolition of the wine tax he would support the motion. The Minister for Primary Industry is engaged in a conversation at the table. </para>

While this tax is imposed on the industry the growers will be forced to meet an overhead which is not fair and not desirable.

        <para class="block">This indicates what I said earlier, that there was no necessity in a rich and prosperous country like ours to impose this tax to gather such a paltry sum of money. It is paltry when looked at against the background of other sources of revenue which are available to the Government. How is it that before these proposals were introduced into this House a certain member of the House was able to issue a Press statement in regard to it? This makes a complete and utter mockery of the remarks by the Minister for Customs and Excise who said introducing these proposals:  1 understand that my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry, will be releasing a Press statement which will elaborate upon the Government&#39;s consideration of Professor Grant&#39;s report. </para>

            <para>- Thank you. By retaining a tax on the wine industry the Government gets more out of a bottle of wine than the grower, and that is the very point that we on this side have been bitterly opposed to since the inception of this tax. It may be argued that this may not be so with all wines at all times. There could be one statistical quarterly period in which this may perhaps not be so, but overall, as a chief spokesman for the industry has said, this is what it means. As far as we on this side are concerned, the whole structure of the rural industry has been bled white by the middle man, and in this case beyond the middle man must come the Government. It is wrong in principle for Government supporters to stand up in this place purporting to represent the rural interests of this country when this Government inflicts a form of tax that removes from growers an adequate and proper return or takehome pay in return for the efforts and risks that they have undetaken in any form of rural industry, let alone in the wine industry. This is an industry that is reliant on buoyancy and growth. The Government has stopped that growth. It was suggested that the industry has been marking time and will now pick up. Its growth has stopped and has been stopped now for nigh on 2 years. The various co-operatives, particularly the smaller co-operatives, can testify as to what has been inflicted upon them by the imposition of the wine excise. To use the words of the honouable member for Angas, it is not too late. I suggest to him tonight that, whilst it might be difficult for him to get the Government to change direction, he himself as an individual has an opportunity at this time to change direction and support and really represent the people in his electorate by the very simple method available to him in this House tonight. I suggest that in his own interest he take that opportunity. </para>

          <para>- I have been under attack tonight on several scores. In the brief time available to me I shall reply to the charges. Let me first of all deal with the Press release that the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> and the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> have mentioned. I think it must be obvious to the Opposition as well as to other members of this House that already, rightly or wrongly, there has been an announcement in the Press relating to the removal of the wine excise. As well as that an announcement was made at 1.30 this afternoon. On the basis of this announcement and because this matter is of grave importance to me and my electorate, I issued a very concise and generalised Press report. I do not retract it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am becoming a little fed up, and so are very many other people in my electorate and in towns in South Australia, with the completely hollow stand taken by members of the Opposition. The Opposition spokesman on rural matters was not able to, or did not attend a meeting some time ago, and the honourable member for Sturt turned up in his place. At that meeting - I suppose for the fifth time - I again taunted the Opposition with accusations of playing politics. If I make that charge I should substantiate it. I substantiate it this way. The Labor Party has had endless opportunities to produce a policy that would help the wine industry or the wine growers. As far as I am aware it has never produced such a policy. I have said time and time again that its only reply all along the line has been that the Government introduced the excise and that the Government should remove it. This is a legitimate Opposition ploy, but there are those of us on this side of the House who have not had the luxury of putting a political argument all the time but who have worked sincerely and extremely hard to try to get the Government to change direction for the sake of the industry and the growers. This is an entirely honest and sincere remark. I do not blame the Opposition for the stand it has taken. It has its game to play, but let those people who have a genuine interest in the industry, whether they be growers or anybody else, know that there are those of us on this side of the House who have worked hard to make the Government reverse its trend in relation to this matter. </para>
        <para>I can understand very well the disappointment of the Opposition tonight. It is clutching at any straws. The issue is not whether there are straws that can be clutched at. The issue is that the wine grape growers, the wine industry and indeed those in country towns have very well understood that we have been able to get some benefit for them. I have not the slightest doubt that this measure will be very well accepted in the wine producing areas. From time to time we are confronted with the problem of how to collect revenue. I cannot talk for the rest of those on this side of the House involved in this matter, but I have always said from the word go that the disadvantage suffered by the wine industry in relation to its competitors will not be removed until the industry picks up. I personally will try to do whatever I can to reverse conditions that adversely affect that industry. Everybody in this House knows that this is true. Just prior to Easter, speaking to the motion That the House do now adjourn&#39;, I stated almost precisely what I have repeated here tonight, and all I got were mild grins and nods of agreement from the Opposition. Not once did members of the Opposition take the opportunity to refute the charges - I hope polite charges - I was levelling at their heads. We have had enough of this nonsense. For too long now people have been trying to play a cheap political trick in relation to wine excise. It has been fought out through the Press and fought out- </para>

            <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Dawson moving: That this House condemns the action of the honourable member for Angas for releasing a Press statement at approximately 5 p.m. today announcing a Government cut in the wine excise based on a confidential ministerial statement which was embargoed until the commencement of the speech by the Minister for Customs and Excise at 8.37 p.m. tonight. </para>

          <para class="block">I will be quite brief because the facts are clear. The facts are here in these 2 documents. One is a document labelled &#39;For Press - embargoed until the commencement of the speech by the Minister for Customs and Excise&#39;. The other document is entitled &#39;Wine Industry - A statement by the Honourable Ian Sinclair, M.P., Minister for Primary Industry&#39;. The Minister for Customs and Excise commenced his speech at 8.37 p.m. Then it would be assumed that the embargo would be released and this document allowed to be made public by the Press. At 5 o&#39;clock this afternoon a Press statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> O&#39;H. Giles, M.H.R. for Angas was headed &#39;Government cuts wine excise by 50 per cent&#39;. </para>

            <para>- I second the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders moved by the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson).</inline> I think that his motive in moving it should bring to the attention of this Parliament that this must be gross contempt of the Parliament by the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles).</inline> It might well also be a breach of the Crimes Act by the Minister to place an embargo on a document and then have it released by a private member. It is known right throughout the length and breadth of this country that parliamentary procedure demands that when an embargo is placed on a document it must not be released until that period has elapsed. Yet the honourable member for Angas released to the Press at about 5.30 p.m. a document which this Parliament was preparing to debate at about 8.37 p.m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One cannot escape the conclusion that the honourable member was prepared to do this to take advantage of and take the glamour away from a Country Party Minister, because the Liberal Party is fighting the Australian Country Party tooth and nail from one end of Australia to the other. This was an attempt by the honourable member for Angas to take the credit for what has been done, irrespective of what was in the honourable member&#39;s statement. It is interesting to note that the information was released at S.30 p.m., before the close of trading in South Australia and Western Australia. Would it be that the honourable member for Angas wanted to put a few dollars in the coffers of certain people in whom he might be interested? Now you see the sinister implications of what he has done. Aha! It comes out. </para>

Let us look at its implications. A Minister prepared to make a statement at 8.30 p.m. He made it at 8.37 p.m. He might just as well have torn it up, because from one end of Australia to the other the Press has blazoned forth that that custodian of the wine growers&#39; interests - who would not vote on his own motion in the Parliament on one occasion - had announced it prior to the Minister coming before the nation to announce it. With your great knowledge of the Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have you ever experienced greater contempt of the Parliament? That is why I know by the look on your face tonight, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that you feel the same as I do. </para>

              <para>- If I might say so, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you did look so kindly. This matter has serious implications in respect of the issuing of ministerial statements. It is a matter that should be debated in this Parliament, and the only way to do so is by the suspension of Standing Orders. This is a matter not connected with the issues you have stated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> but connected with whether or not a Minister can place an embargo on a document and have it released by a private member about 3 hours in advance. That is the matter on which we are to decide. I believe that the honourable member concerned should have the matter debated in this Parliament and at least be given an opportunity to say why he took this unprecedented action which, in my mind, is unparalleled in the history of this Parliament. I formally second the motion. I hope that it will be carried, because a high principle is involved and the honourable member for Angas must answer to this Parliament for his infamous conduct. </para>

            <para>- I, too, treat this as a most serious matter and I wish to say only 2 things. I have said them already, but I think it is right that I should repeat them. An afternoon paper - without actually naming it, but it is here if anybody wishes to see it - quoted quite fully the sort of news that has been relayed to the House by the Minister. The 1.30 p.m. radio news did the same thing. If I am in contempt of the House - and I trust that I am not - it is because I produced a Press release on the basis of those 2 announcements, perhaps in error of proper procedure - maybe that is so - because of my complete concern for my own electorate and my own growers on this matter, and I do not apologise for that concern. </para>

              <para>- You may adopt that attitude, but the plain fact is that it is a recognised principle in this Parliament that no-one sets aside a request by a Minister that an embargo be placed on a Press release. That is exactly what has happened on this occasion. I do not know how I stand in relation to procedure, but I intend to move that this matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges. </para>

              <para>- I will read it out in a moment. Three-and-a-half hours in advance the public of Australia heard an announcement which purported to declare that the Government of Australia had taken a decision with regard to wine excise. The honourable member for Angas has told the House that he heard that. The second source of his information on this appeared in a newspaper. I do not share my honourable friend&#39;s timidity in naming it, because this is a public document - the Sun&#39;. It is no reflection on that paper, on the proprietor, on the journalist involved or on anybody else. On page 2 the heading was, &#39;Wine excise halved. The Federal Government has decided to halve the excise of 50c a gallon on wine&#39;. . </para>

              <para>- The honourable member is coming to another question. I am dealing now with the honourable member for Angas. I will come later to the other point of how it was leaked. That is an entirely different question. The Opposition&#39;s charge is against the honourable member for Angas. This is not put in any speculative fashion. It is put in the positive sense: The Federal Government has decided to halve the excise of 50c a gallon on wine&#39;. That is the second source available to the honourable member for Angas upon which to found a statement. It is a matter of notoriety that the honourable member for Angas has, from the time of the imposition of the excise, been vexed about it. That is not telling tales out of school. I was in the honourable gentleman&#39;s electorate - I hope not to his embarrassment - some months ago and I met scores of growers who were concerned about this. Right throughout the length and breadth of his electorate his people have known that he has tried to have that excise removed. </para>

One was the Australian Broadcasting Commission - and I hope I am not doing it an injustice; at least it was one of the wireless stations - and the second was a newspaper report. This, as I say, is not put in any speculative fashion. This is put in a positive, emphatic, assertive fashion. The Government has decided&#39;, it says, and on that basis, 3i hours after the wireless report and, I would submit, at least 2 hours after this newspaper report was published, the honourable member for Angas put out his statement. The charge against him cannot be asserted. </para>
          <para>As to the other inquiry about how this was leaked, we have all lived here long enough to know that stories get out galore, and to try to find them all is to try to clinch all the elements of an impossibility. If you want to pursue anything, by ail means pursue as to how this story appeared, but the charge you make against the honourable member for Angas can, and I hope will, be refused. </para>

            <para>- I think this matter needs to be kept in correct perspective. It is no crime for a newspaperman who obtains legitimately information of a confidential government decision to publish it. There is, of course, a very serious imputation against somebody in the Government ranks when news affecting a tariff or excise decision, which is a financial matter, is enabled to be published. However, once it has been published in a newspaper, then any member of this House, unless he is already pledged confidentially to keep that information secret, is from that time on entitled to speak about it. The honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> says that he heard it on the radio, that he read it in a newspaper. If that is so, if he had no confidential source of information from the government but took a newspaper report which stated definitely that the Government had done or was about to do this, then in my opinion the honourable member for Angas did not commit any breach of privilege or offend in any way against the rules of the House. If he had been briefed by a Minister - which he denies - to release ahead of time a confidential announcement, both he and the Minister would be very seriously at fault. </para>

            <para>- I want briefly to say that this matter is far more serious than the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> would have us believe, irrespective of the newspaper report. In the time that I have been here I can remember many newspaper reports on budget days, stating what was to be in the budget and which were not accurate. In this instance information has been given to the Press and I do not think any of us would believe that the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> would have accepted that information had he not been sure it was correct. This information on a financial matter has been released at a time when it could affect the operations of the share market in at least 2 States. It is a premature release of a Cabinet financial decision and it is an extremely serious departure from proper practice. Whether or not the honourable member for Angas is the person at fault is a matter for conjecture but the fact is that, on a matter of important financial detail, release of the information has been made to the Press prior to the announcement being made to this Parliament. </para>

              <para>- This is why the Standing Orders should be suspended. What would a Minister&#39;s reaction be if an Opposition member were to release details of a ministerial statement which had been given to him in confidence prior to its announcement in the House? Government supporters would scream from the house tops. I believe that this matter is too serious to be treated lightly. It is my belief that the House should refer the matter to the Privi leges Committee and I think that that action could be taken on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>-  There are only a few minutes remaining before the time allotted for discussion on the motion to suspend Standing Orders expires. However, I think we have heard sufficient to have made up our minds quite clearly as to what is the position of the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles).</inline> The honourable member is a person whom we all know and who has always carried out his duties in this House in an honourable way and has observed in a dedicated way the procedures and the Standing Orders of this House. In fact, in association with his duties as  Deputy  Government Whip, he has always upheld the Standing Orders and the procedures of the House, and I acknowledge that on this occasion. This matter has been clearly explained by the honourable member for Angas when he stated that he obtained the information that the Government was to reduce the wine excise from a radio report and from a Press report and, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Alan Fraser)</inline> said, this information could also have been obtained in that way by any other honourable member in this House. If the information was in the interests of an honourable member&#39;s electorate, of course he would take the opportunity of seeing that the information which he had read in the newspaper and heard over the air was conveyed to his electorate. As Leader of the House, I fully accept the explanation that has been given by the honourable member for Angas, as I am sure that every fair minded honourable member in this House will.

              <para>- Yes, I listened to the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> earlier today. I am quite satisfied as a result of what was said by the honourable member for Riverina that there has been a deliberate attempt by the Minister for Primary Industry to give to the honourable member for Angas information that would be denied to other members of this Parliament. I do not set aside what was said by the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> I respect his views in these matters. I certainly do not reflect on the integrity of the honourable member for Angas, but I believe that he has been placed in a most invidious position. What has happened in this Parliament today and what has happened in relation to this statement is a set of circumstances that would not be tolerated in relation to, for example, excise duties imposed during a Budget session and would not be accepted by any government in this country. But that is exactly what has happened on this occasion. I want to put to you quite plainly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> what happened in relation to this matter. The honourable member for Angas had the statement on his desk before the Minister delivered it. </para>

              <para>- I put it to the House that there has been collusion between the Minister for Primary Industry and the honourable member for Angas which involves a principle long accepted in this Parliament that knowledge of any matter involving excise duty will not be made available to the public before the opportunity has been given to the Minister to deliver this information to the Parliament. However, on this occasion, because of the attitude of the Minister for Primary Industry, and no doubt because of what happened earlier this afternoon as a result of the initiative shown by the honourable member for Riverina, there was collusion between the Minister for Primary Industry and the honourable member for Angas. I do not attach the blame for this to the honourable member for Angas. I think the guilty person is the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>

What I am suggesting to this House in all seriousness is that this matter should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. If the Minister has nothing to hide he will support the motion. If the honourable member for Angas has nothing to hide he will support this motion.

            <para>-  Yes, I second the motion. This is easily the most serious of all charges that can be laid. I do not know whether it is true. No-one has the right to assume that the charge is true. The charge has been made and, if it is true, it is a very serious matter and would put the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in the position where he would have to resign or be removed from Cabinet. Precedents for this can be traced back to the British House of Commons on many occasions. Hugh Dalton was asked and forced to resign by the Attlee Government when he released information touching upon matters of this character and this Parliament owes it to itself, to the community and to the great Australian nation never to allow a Minister entrusted with secrets of State to be in a position where he can handle them idly, carelessly, recklessly or in a way which would enable other citizens, especially privileged citizens of the community, to make enormous sums of money. Huge amounts could be involved in foreknowledge of excise changes. One does not need to be terribly sharp in mind to understand the seriousness of this charge. It has been alleged - and when the Privileges Committee is hearing this matter witnesses will be called, or can be called - to show that the statement which the Minister read to the House after 8 o&#39;clock was- </para>

              <para>- The statement of the Minister for Primary Industry was on the desk of the honourable member for Angas. That is not an indictment of the honourable member for Angas but of the Minister who had custody of this most important and highly confidential information. The Minister must have betrayed his trust or else somebody in his office who betrayed their&#39;s for the Press to have known of it at the time when the honourable member for Angas said that he first heard of it and for the radio to have been able to  refer  to it at 1 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. I want to refer briefly to a section of the Crimes Act to indicate why this matter must go to the Privileges Committee. Other sections relate to this subject matter, but section 79 has a direct bearing upon what has happened, or what is alleged to have happened. I do not say that I can prove it. It has not been proved, and in fairness to the Minister this must be said. There is only circumstantial evidence, very strong circumstantial evidence, to suggest that the Minister is guilty of an offence against the Crimes Act. But there is no proof and no-one at this stage has a right to charge him with it or to accuse him of the offence. The relevant part of section 79 states: </para>

              <para>- I say this in all seriousness. When a person is accused of committing an offence that carries a penalty of 7 years imprisonment it is not a joke. It is not fair to the person concerned for the charge to be made without his having the opportunity of disproving it. It is utterly unjust to say that he is guilty, until it is proven. I therefore support the motion for the reasons I have already indicated. This is the most serious charge I have ever heard levelled directly in this Parliament against a Minister of the Crown. I invite any other honourable member present to say that he can remember a Minister of the Crown having laid against him a charge which carries a penalty of 7 years imprisonment. This is reaching a point where unless this Minister is acquitted by the Privileges Committee this Parliament has to impeach him. </para>

              <para>- You are quite right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I would not say that a person was guilty on what has been said tonight. I would have no right to say that he is guilty. I think I made it clear that - and I emphasise it - I was not saying that he is guilty. I said that there was a charge and it had to be answered. I do not want to belabour the point. It is too serious a matter for us to belabour it. The Minister is entitled to be given a fair opportunity and we have no right, at this stage of the proceedings, to do more than merely ask that the matter go to the Privileges Committee, because to do more than that perhaps could prejudice the Minister&#39;s position when the Privileges Committee deals with the matter. But that the Privileges Committee must deal with it, of course, is surely incontestable. Nobody will contest my assertion and demand that the Privileges Committee deal with it. To do otherwise is to do an injustice to the Parliament and to the people and also a grave injustice to the Minister. He must be given the opportunity to clear his name. </para>

            <para>-  The great champions of justice in the Opposition have just moved a motion which suggests that unless acquitted by the Priviliges Committee I am guilty. Of what am I guilty? I am guilty apparently because a bit of paper was apparently seen. I do not know whether it was seen. I do not know whether it was there. I do not know whether it was in his possession. The statement had an embargo on it. It was on the desk of my colleague, the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles).</inline> That is the substance of the charge. But I am not merely being charged. According to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and according to the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> I am guilty unless I am acquitted. So the great champions of justice from the Opposition completely deny, before we start on debating the motion, the chance of a person (a) to be charged and (b) to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty. So, I repeat, the great champions of justice in the Opposition are so concerned with upholding the law that they are not prepared to give an individual the opportunity to (a) be charged and (b) to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty. </para>

          <para>Secondly, I think that it is interesting to consider the motivation behind the motion that was moved in this House this morning. All honourable members will recall that motion. It was a motion which sought the suspension of Standing Orders so that a matter relating to wine excise could be debated. I wonder why that motion was moved this morning. Could it have been just fortuitous? Could it have been that the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> and the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> might have thought that there may have been a decision before the House rose?

There have been members of the Opposition coming and going in this House trying to decide what exactly the circumstances are, because none of them really knows, except those 2 members of the Opposition who raised the matter in the House this morning. Perhaps one can give them credit for raising it when they did not know about it. Perhaps it was just coincidental that they raised it this morning.

              <para>- Before the interruption I was trying to explain to this House the basis of an allegation on which the Opposition accused me of being guilty before I had a chance of establishing, firstly, the basis of the charge or, secondly, whether it did happen - that a paper was seen on the desk of the honourable member for Angus. I have no idea whether there was such a paper there. Certainly a statement was prepared by me and a speech was prepared by my colleague the Minister for Customs and Excise. If honourable members care to look at the Press statement prepared for me they will see at the top the word &#39;Embargo&#39;. There was an embargo on the statement until the commencement of the speech in this House by the Minister for Customs and Excise, and there was no cause for any person to have that statement and to publish it until the commencement of the speech in this House by my colleague. I am not in a position to know who has copies of that statement or where the copies have gone. I know that a speech was prepared by the Minister for Customs and Excise, and I know that a Press statement was made by me. </para>

          <para>I would suggest that I would have been in dereliction of my duty if I had not prepared such a statement. Members of this House and members of the public would not have had the amplification that was necessary of the speech made by my colleage the Minister for Customs and Excise. It is utter nonsense to suggest that there has been on my part an intended giving to the honourable member for Angus of information which was not, in any way, available to him - apparently as he has stated in this House tonight - through news releases or through the newspaper which he produced and to which the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> referred in his brief, eloquent speech tonight. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>I think the whole basis of this allegation is so minimal and so paltry that it deserves to be treated with the contempt that it deserves. The procedures of this House and the responsibilities of members of Parliament to this country are enormous. It is obviously essential that every one of us meets his responsibilities according to the highest code of ethics and of conscience. It is in accordance with that code that I can assure members of this House and the listening members of the Australian public that I administer my responsibilities as does every other member of this Government. It is absolutely ridiculous to base a charge on the paltry story that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has put before us tonight. It is obviously necessary that there be statements, to which I have referred. I have explained the circumstances of those statements. They are here available for all members of this House to see. It is on that premise that I believe there is absolutely no justification for a reference of this matter to the Committee of Privileges. </para>

          <para>With all respect I think this is what the question is at the moment. It is a question about the irregularity of an announcement. I am one of those who respect and observe the proprieties of this House on most occasions. I submit that at no time could an incident such as this have occurred in any other part of the Commonwealth without it being regarded as serious. The Government has tried to finalise this matter this evening by the weight of numbers. If I were a punter, which I am not, I would have thought that the lowering of the excise on wine would have been a famous announcement in the next Budget, but because it has been announced now- </para>

        <para>Surely this matter concerns the proprieties of this House. One need not go into the sorts of incidents that have happened in other parliaments. On one occasion the Honourable Hugh Dalton, who was a Treasurer, resigned from the House of Commons because unfortunately he let slip a certain reference to a pressman before he came to deliver a Budget. This case is not quite as significant as that one. Honourable members opposite may laugh about this because they think it does not matter, but it is an important matter as far as the wine industry is concerned. My friend this afternoon- </para>

            <para>- Yes, and the question relates to the impropriety of an announcement purportedly made by an honourable member opposite, that the excise duty on wine would be alleviated. That is the only point at issue. It concerns the pre-announcement of the proposal in the House. I am asking: If standing order 293 means anything, does that not suggest that such an announcement can be made only by a Minister in the House? The argument is that somebody - not a Minister - made the announcement outside the House. </para>

            <para>- Order! May I say, in trying to clarify the point of order, which I think should have been taken earlier when the debate was taking place on this matter, that as I recollect the position this announcement was made in the House by the Minister for Customs and Excise, and, as I understand it, standing order 293 applies to statements made in the House and not outside the House. </para>

            <para>- I am asking you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to clarify any doubt that there may be as to the meaning of standing order 293. As I understand the position at the moment, somebody outside the House made an announcement that there would be an alleviation of a certain duty. I have stated twice already the terms of standing order 293, but I will read the standing order again and I would like all honourable members to give some weight to every word contained in it. It reads: </para>

To my knowledge no member of this House, other than a Minister, has made this announcement. I think that is correct. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The Minister for Primary Industry made an allegation and an imputation, which I think should be clarified, against the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> and the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> in relation to the suspension of Standing Orders this morning. The Minister implied that perhaps the honourable members knew of a Cabinet decision. I do not know whether the 2 honourable members knew of a Cabinet decision but I can clear their names by saying that the decision to move the suspension of Standing Orders with respect to this matter was made by the Australian Labor Party last week. It was left to me to make the decision when it would be moved. I made that decision at the end of last week. I notified the honourable member for Riverina early this week that it would be moved straight after question time today. </para>

I just want to clear up finally the misrepresentation of my position this morning by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> in an exchange in the cross benches. To put the Ministers clearly and definitely into the proper position I refer to the minutes, which I have here, of the meeting on 16th May of the Rural Resources Committee of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in which it was resolved to suspend Standing Orders or to take equivalent action on the last day of sitting - if no action has been taken by the Government by that time - to debate the wine tax. We waited patiently for the Government to repent its sins. There was no prior knowledge. As a matter of fact, the only knowledge I had came slightly after 5 o&#39;clock from the Press Gallery when I was informed that the cut in the excise had already been announced there. I took a very serious view of that. </para>

            <para>- I do. During the course of his remarks to the House tonight the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> referred to my colleague the honourable member for Riverina and to me in relation to the suspension of Standing Orders this morning. I refer the Minister to a question asked in the Senate on 9th May and to the reply given by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate on that date. I refer him to the article by the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> in the &#39;Advertiser&#39; on 8th April this year, and I also refer the Minister to what was said by the Minister representing him in the Senate. In addition I refer to the statement that the Minister made in this House this morning during the course of his closing remarks to the House - this is my point of explanation - on when the House could expect some further information on what was to occur in regard to this matter. </para>

The Minister replied to me: &#39;You would be very surprised at what is going to happen during the course of this day&#39;. I ask the Minister to tell the truth. </para>

          <para>I think it was equally the intention of parliament simply to ensure that the rights and wrongs of the matter which had led to a strike should be fully dealt with by discussion at a conference.

It has not said that the processes of arbitration are to proceed notwithstanding the strike.&#39; </para>

            <para>Estimates of the number and cost of specialist medical consultations in each State are set out below. There is an average time lag of just under 3 months between the date of service and the date on which the contributor lodges his claim for medical benefits with his organisation. Thus, a substantial proportion of services in the September and December quarters of 1970 were for services given under the previous Medical Benefits Scheme. The statistics shown are therefore confined to the March, June and September quarters of 1971, and show services which relate predominantly to those listed in the Medical Benefits Schedule which came into effect on 1st July 1970. </para>

            <para>In deriving $21 m as the administration costs of the Commission, it is believed that very few doctors would be willing to bill the Fund direct and accept 85 per cent of the sheduled fee as full payment for the service rendered. Also, in the absence of a deterrent against small claims for medical benefits, it has been estimated that expenses incurred by the proposed Commission in processing medical benefits claims would be little less than the management expenses of existing registered medical benefit organisations. </para>

            <para>The information has been supplied in the past by the relevant electric supply authorities. The collation of this information into a statement of comparative electricity costs is attended by difficulties. There is a range of factors which affects costs and returns and because differences can arise in the interpretation and subsequent use of these figures it is considered preferable for the honourable member himself to seek the information. The addresses of the authorities whose figures have previously been given are supplied below. </para>

              <para>The American black poplar or eastern Cottonwood, Populus deltoides Marsh., is suitable for matchwood, plywood, toys, furniture and packaging wool. </para>

          <para>This poplar and its hybrids have been used for the above purposes for many decades in some overseas countries. The species does well in carefully chosen areas throughout eastern Australia; 2 plantations to produce wood for matches were started about 10 years ago. </para>
          <para>Poplars are normally planted as cuttings, the cuttings belongs to each &#39;strain&#39; (clone) originally being derived from a single seedling. There are, therefore, a potentially unlimited number of different strains of this poplar only some hundreds of which are available in Australia at the present time. In general, those from the southern part of the natural range of the species have performed best here, and about 5 of these have been used commercially. </para>

              <para>The main commercially-used clones of Populus deltoides have been severely infected by the foliage rust Melampsora medusae Thum. in New South Wales this summer. It appears that heavy infection will lead to loss of growth and in some cases to the death of infected trees. The rust will not prevent the utilisation of trees which are already of merchantable size. Observations to date show that infection is more or less limited to Populus deltoides, but not all clones of that species are susceptible to infection. </para>

          <para>Officers of the Forestry and Timber Bureau have been unable to discover any record of poplar cuttings having been introduced recently; it is improbable that the disease would have come in years ago with known legal introductions and have escaped notice until this year. </para>
          <para>Importation of spores on the clothing of a traveller from, say, the south-east of the United States of America, where the disease is common. A very large number of spores could be carried in a single trouser cuff. </para>
          <para>Transfer of spores to Australia by intercontinental air movement. There has been speculation that the introduction of coffee rust to Brazil a few years ago occurred in this way. The very rapid apparent spread of the disease throughout New South Wales is consistent with the effective dispersal of spores by air movement, and also with the patterns of spread of rusts of other crops. </para>

          <para>In the case of unemployment benefit the period is generally 16 days comprising the 7 days waiting period before eligibility commences to accrue, a further 7 days until the first weekly instalment is due and 2 days for assessment of entitlement and preparation and transmission by post of the cheque. However, should the applicant have been in receipt of benefit during the 12 weeks preceding the date of application, no further waiting period is imposed and the first weekly cheque could be received on the eighth or ninth day after application. </para>
          <para>For sickness benefit, the average times are generally comparable with those stated for unemployment benefit although the necessity to enquire into matters affecting eligibility e.g. about sick pay entitlement from employers, tends to increase the investigational period. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Unemployment benefit  is  ordinarily approved for payment within two working days after the first weekly instalment becomes due. Because not less than 13 weeks  is  allowed for lodgement of a sickness benefit claim, some payment may be due at the date of application. Departmental procedures provide for specially accelerated action where there is evidence of hardship, but  a  general relaxation of normal investigational processes would, it is considered, lead to  a  significant increase in illegal payments. It is not possible to assess the extent of that increase.  lifts (Question No. 5794) </para>

As at that date formal replies to the previous letter, of 7th September 1970, had not been received from New South Wales and Victoria, but the dispatch of the letter of 1st October obviated the need for further replies to the earlier letter. The letter of 1st October 1971 stated the Commonwealth&#39;s position on the Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs - a subject also dealt with on 5th October 1971 in a statement to the House by the Minister for Education and Science- and did not call for any reply. </para>

              <para>In regard to the information sought on the amounts advanced in housing loans by (a) terminating and (b) permanent building societies in each State, the Commonwealth Statistician has advised that details of the activities of permanent and terminating building societies by State are now available for 1969-70. However, the scope of the annual building society collection has been modified since the previous answer was given so that all building societies, including societies which partly or wholly operate on Starr Bowkett principles, are classified as either &#39;permanent&#39; or terminating&#39;. Figures supplied previously for the years 1963-64 to 1968-69 have been revised to provide a comparable series of statistics on the new basis. Information is not available on that basis for the years prior to 1963-64. Table 1 shows details of loans paid over during the financial years of societies ending in the years shown. </para>

              <para>Officers of the Northern Fisheries Unit of my Department reported on the dumping of prawns shortly after the opening of the prawning season in the Weipa area on 7th April 1972. While no accurate measurement has been made of the quantities dumped, the best available estimates made by fishermen and my Department would suggest that not more than 250,000 lb were dumped, not the 400,000 lb reported in the Press. My officers report that the dumping was restricted almost entirely to trawlers which had entered the fishery without first obtaining a supply contract with one of the processing companies. These companies naturally give unloading preference to trawlers which do have supply contracts. Despite ample knowledge that the waters under Queensland&#39;s jurisdiction were open to prawning as from 1st April and adjacent proclaimed waters under Commonwealth jurisdiction were open as from 7th April, several processing companies did not have their facilities on hand at Weipa to unload the trawlers by those dates. The position is now much improved and the Northern Fisheries Unit has reported that there have been no recent instances of prawns being dumped because the trawlers were unable to dispose of them to a processor. </para>

A prime objective of the current trials is to obtain sufficient data to be able to designate the situations and water-types for which the Sirotherm process is likely to have an advantage. </para>

              <para>Both CSIRO and ICI Australia Ltd are interested in studying any problems of water salinity to which the Sirotherm process might be applied. Unfortunately, in the case of Coober Pedy and Andamooka, I am informed that local subterranean waters have salinity levels well above that for which the process is designed. It is understood that Coober Pedy has water of 17,000 ppm total dissolved solids and Andamooka has 60,000 ppm - nearly one-half and twice the salinity of sea water respectively. The Sirotherm process is likely to reach its economic limit in treating waters containing up to 3,000 parts per million. </para>

              <para>CSIRO has not made fuel economy trials employing a 10 per cent blend of grain alcohol in petrol. Its report assumes that there would be a 5 per cent loss in fuel economy on the basis of published data from other laboratories.  (2)I do not know of any, research data pub lished by an automotive laboratory in Western Australia on the performance changes resulting from the addition of 10 per cent grain alcohol to super grade petrol. </para>

              <para>Since the research data was not available, it did not receive consideration. However after the report had been completed in December 1971, it was noticed that &#34;The Countryman&#39; for 6th January 1972 reported that an improvement in both power output and economy was obtained with a 10 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> cent alcohol-petrol blend. A reference to this article was inserted in the CSIRO report. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>CSIRO did not consider it worthwhile holding up the publication of its report to allow the report in &#34;The Countryman&#39; to be investigated because it was thought unlikely that the findings would be substantiated. The reasons were twofold: firstly, the heat content (i.e. the calorific value) of alcohol is about 30 per cent less than that of petrol so that the energy per gallon available in a blended fuel must be less than that of petrol; and, secondly, as far as CSIRO could ascertain, no research data substantiating the report had been published in the scientific literature, while the research data on which the assumed 5 per cent loss of fuel economy was based had been published by reputable laboratories in the United States and Canada. </para>

          <para>As each period of the Science Facilities Programme has approached its end, my Department has obtained from the State education departments and from individual non-government schools by means of questionnaires, considerable information about the effectiveness of the Programme and the extent to which its aims are being achieved. In addition, individual members of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Standards for Science Facilities In Independent Secondary Schools are constantly In touch with non-government secondary schools. Those Committee members report in detail to my Department on the effectiveness of the Programme in particular schools. </para>

              <para>and (2) In view of the wide range of sources of housing finance and the varying influences to which they are subject, it is not possible to generalise as to the extent that increases or reductions in bank interest rates have affected the levels of interest rates paid by home purchasers as a whole. So far as bank finance is concerned, the recent reduction In the maximum overdraft rate is in fact reflecting in the rates charged by trading banks on both new and existing loans to home purchasers (except in respect of existing loans for which interest rates have been fixed for specified periods). The main lending rates of savings banks have not been changed since April 1970 although there have recently been some reductions in respect of housing loans previously attracting rates over 7 per cent per annum. </para>

          <para>It is usual for pensioners to be given written notification of variations in their rates of pension. However, on this occasion the time between the date of the Treasurer&#39;s announcement of the new rates and the dates from which the increases were payable did not permit individual notices to be prepared. To have issued individual notices could have meant delaying the payment of the increases. Rather than do this, it was decided to advertise the changes in the Press. </para>

            <para>Following the receipt of representations earlier this year, a thorough inspection of the telephone service provided in the premises of Duncan McWade Industries Pty Ltd was carried out in March last and this showed that the service was operating normally and there was no evidence of any interference or tapping having taken place. </para>
            <para>I might add that the Post Office is most anxious that the privacy of telephone conversations be safeguarded and the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act and the Post and Telegraph Act and Regulations provide for severe penalties to be imposed on persons convicted of intercepting telephone conversations or using any unauthorised device for the purpose of listenting to or recording such conversations. </para>

In another three cases, there were some grounds for suspicion that ships might have been responsible but, in each case, the ship in question was not registered in Australia and in consequence the Commonwealth Act did not apply; further, the evidence was not sufficient to warrant Australia exercising its right under the Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil to bring the evidence to the notice of the country of registry As regards the seventh case, while evidence pointed to a particular ship being responsible for the pollution, the ship, which was not a tanker, was not registered in Australia and the evidence was not transmitted to the country of registry because it was considered that, under the Convention as it then stood, a defence was available to the ship in that, being a non-tanker, it was proceeding to a port not provided with adequate facilities for reception of residues of oil. </para>

The borrowing is expected to be for an amount of 10 billion yen (about SA27m). There is no proposal before the Government at present for a public bond issue in the Federal Republic of Germany. However, the Government did borrow by way of a public bond issue in Germany last January. The amount of the borrowing was DM100 million ($A26m). The bonds were issued at par and carried an interest rate of 7 per cent payable annually.

          <para>Final agreement to the terms depends on their being considered fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the time. The Treasurer&#39;s Press statement concerned the proposed borrowing in Japan, a copy of which is being forwarded to the Honourable Member, explained that it would serve Australia&#39;s national interests in such important ways as establishing for Australia a position in a new capital market which will constitute an alternative to existing markets and which seems destined to grow substantially in the years ahead, and making a major contribution to the development of closer financial links (generally with Japan. In a Press Statement on 21st January announcing the terms of the bond issue in Germany, the Treasurer pointed out that it was considered prudent to maintain Australia&#39;s access to large and important capital markets, such as the German one. We had not borrowed in the German market for more than 2 years. (5), (6) and (7) The Government keeps under close review the availability of loan funds on the domestic market. However, the fact is that for many years past the proceeds available from Commonwealth loan transactions in Australiawhich represent the maximum amounts that could be raised with the interest rates and other terms considered appropriate by the Commonwealth and the Loan Council - have almost invariably been substantially less than the borrowing programmes of the Commonwealth and States approved by the Loan Council. Moreover, as indicated above, there are various considerations relevant to Commonwealth borrowing overseas in addition to the factors mentioned by the Honourable Member. </para>

            <para>At the present time, because of workload considerations, detailed records concerning runway use are not maintained on a continuous basis and therefore it is not possible to answer the question in precise terms. However, there has been a necessary sampling of movements data over various time periods during 1969, 1970 and 1971. This has indicated that since early 1969 when the lengthened north/south runway became fully effective and revised noise abatement procedures were implemented, runway use, calculated by deriving percentages from sample statistics and applying them to the total actual landings and take-offs at the airport each year, was of the following order: </para>

        </para>
        <para>Of all departures it has been estimated that about 75 per cent took off towards Botany Bay, 15 per cent towards Coogee, 8 per cent towards Rockdale and 2 per cent towards Marrickville. </para>
        <para>Of all arrivals, about 37.5 per cent approached over Marrickville, 33 per cent over Rockdale, 18 per cent over Coogee and 11.5 per cent over Botany Bay. </para>
        <para>Of all movements at the airport, 43 per cent approached or departed over Botany Bay, 21 per cent over Rockdale, 20 per cent over Marrickville and 16 per cent over the sector east of the airport. </para>
        <para>These percentages are annual average estimates and thus allow for variations in the distribution of movements which must occur because of particular wind and weather conditions. </para>
        <para>Because noise abatement procedures can be more effectively implemented and are more stringent in the evening and late night hours it should bc mentioned that the percentages quoted are not representative of runway use in all periods of the 24 hours. For example only about 17 per cent of the early evening arrivals and only about 2 per cent of the late night arrivals would have approached over the Rockdale sector. In these hours greater use was made and continues to be made of Botany Bay for the flow of traffic. </para>

              <para>The Board&#39;s studies indicate that the area is provided with a satisfactory service from either the Sydney or Newcastle stations and consequently there are no plans for the establishment of additional television services for the GosfordWyong area. A serious difficulty in planning any new service for this area arises from the limitation on VHF television channels. In establishing the present national and commercial services within the Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong area, all channels which can be allocated without interaction with services in adjoining areas have been utilised. The introduction of any new service must thus be considered in the light of possible reductions in service in some other area. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Statistician has provided the following table in answer to the honourable member&#39;s question. These figures, prepared on a national accounting basis, relate to the 20-year period ended 1969-70, and the Statistician advises that he is unable to extend them to cover the 30- year period requested. The Statistician also advises that separate figures for &#39;semi-governmental&#39; organisations of interest paid and total outlay are not available. The transactions of these organisations are reflected in the figures for State authorities given in the table. </para>

              <para>The Group Charging system, incorporating Extended Local Service Areas (ELSA), was approved by Parliament in 1959 as an integral part of the Community Telephone Plan and people in outer metropolitan areas gained considerably from the adoption of this policy as did the majority of subscribers in country areas. The telephone network has since been developed in accordance with the Community Telephone Plan and there are no current plans for a revision of the overall policy. Since the inception of the Group Charging system reviews of individual areas of difficulty have been and will continue to be examined. </para>

              <para>This would be a matter of Government policy. I can say, though, that such an extension in capital city zones could not be considered in isolation. It is clear that consideration of increasing the size of capital city zones would need to take into account the question of extending country telephone zones similarly. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>If local call charges were to be applied in all cases between exchanges up to say 50 miles apart, a considerable reduction in telephone earnings would result. Then, too, with a local call fee applying up to 50 miles, there would be difficulties in applying the present 51-100 miles trunk charge (57 cents per three minutes during the day) for calls between exchanges only slightly more than 30 miles apart. The same general situation would arise with local call fees applying up to 70 miles. </para>
          <para>For the above reasons alone, it would be necessary to completely revise the tariff structure. The matter would be complicated by the changes in traffic volumes and patterns which would inevitably result; these would necessitate substantial capital expenditure for the provision of additional circuits and the extension and rearrangement of switching equipment in automatic exchanges to maintain an acceptable grade of service. </para>

The Ministers agreed to appoint  a  Judge or retired Judge to undertake a comprehensive investigation of the question. The officers appointed by the Standing Committee have been instructed to prepare terms of reference for the inquiry. It is contemplated that the inquiry will seek the views of all interested, including sociologists, persons concerned in the computer industry, and those responsible for the compilation of public records and statistics. </para>
