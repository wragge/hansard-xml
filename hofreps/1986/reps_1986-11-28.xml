Procedures have now been established to provide for the safety of all occupants of the building in the event of fire or other emergencies. These emergency procedures are supported by an organisation which includes a control room operating 24 hours a day, trained wardens, evacuation teams and first-aid officers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very good friendship. Obviously there is within the motion that the Leader of the House has moved a sinister overtone. Behind that benign exterior and that bland Irish manner of his lies the inevitable consequence that this motion means yet again that we are hostage to Senate fortunes. Yesterday we had a motion that had us begging on bended knee for Senate approval to call before a parliamentary committee certain members of the Senate so that a committee of this place, pursuing a reference sent by you, Madam Speaker, might be able to conclude its deliberations. Today we find that, because the Senate undertaking properly in accordance with its procedures its scrutiny of the Government's legislation may not be ready to pass legislation over to us, we are all going to be kept back late this evening. We have had a number of discussions in this place about the tardiness of the Government in getting its program before us. There are a number of very serious matters that we believe the House should consider, and it would have been far more appropriate had the Leader of the House, exercising that customary parliamentary skill with which we have come to be familiar, instead of suggesting that we sit late tonight had said that the House should resume next Monday or Tuesday, or even Wednesday. That would have been far more appropriate, given the fact that there is quite a deal of legislation before the Senate and a number of very serious matters affecting the well-being of the people of Australia that we believe should be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the hilarity of the end of session it is easy to forget that Australians face both a financial penalty for failing to lodge their returns under the fringe benefits tax legislation and a significant consequence in terms of the administrative responsibility that the legislation imposes upon them. They get no tax deduction if they require their financial advisers to prepare their returns. Therefore, 28 November 1986 is really the farewell Bob tax day in more ways than one. I am not sure whether `FBT' is quite as appropriate as `FPT' because it seems now that it is farewell Paul day rather than farewell Bob day. If there is to be a consequence of extending the sitting hours of this Parliament, it should be that we pass on to all taxpayers the munificence that obviously the taxman has given to the Treasurer (Mr Keating).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the first in a package of four Bills that will give effect to the Government's decision to introduce a petroleum resource rent tax on profits from certain off-shore petroleum pro- jects. The proposed tax regime was announced in detail in June 1984, after extensive consultation with the industry and the States. Petroleum resources are, in their most basic sense, community property and the Government believes that the community as a whole should share in the potentially high returns from the exploitation of these scarce, non-renewable resources. At the same time it is recognised that participants in petroleum projects who do not earn high profits in relation to the amount invested and the risk involved, particularly when oil prices decline, should be able to operate secure in the know-ledge that excise and royalties which are based on production will not apply. The Government believes that a resource rent tax related to achieved profits is a more efficient and equitable secondary taxation regime than the excise and royalty system that it is to replace. I emphasise that the proposed tax replaces the existing system-it is not in addition to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to production-based secondary tax regimes, the petroleum resource rent tax will be payable only in respect of projects earning a high rate of return on outlays. Particularly in light of the current volatility of world oil prices, the resource rent tax system thus offers considerable benefits to the petroleum industry. It strikes a reasonable balance between the objectives of satisfying the right of the community as a whole to share in the benefits of profitable off-shore petroleum projects, and of providing the participants with adequate returns for the risks they accept in undertaking off-shore exploration and development activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill follow closely the proposal as announced in June 1984, while accommodating the retention lease system recently introduced in relation to off-shore petroleum exploration. I now turn to outline the more significant features of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>General Application</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The tax is to apply to a person's taxable profits from the recovery of petroleum in off-shore areas where the Commonwealth's Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 applies, other than in areas covered by production licences granted on or before 1 July 1984 and the permit areas from which those production licences were drawn. The tax will therefore not apply to the North West Shelf permit areas or Esso's and BHP's Bass Strait permit area-excise and royalty arrangements will continue to apply in those areas. As the petroleum resource rent tax is profit-based, rather than production-based, it will apply only where there is an excess of project-related receipts for a financial year over both project-related expenditure for the year and undeducted expenditure of previous years brought forward at a compound rate. This compounding of expenditure that remains undeducted at the end of a financial year will be determined according to when it was expended. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure-which is generally exploration expenditure-undertaken more than five years before the coming into force of the first production licence in a permit area will attract compounding at a rate equal to the gross domestic product deflator rate-currently around 7 per cent. More recent expenditure in respect of the project will be carried forward at a rate equal to the prevailing long-term bond rate increased by 15 percentage points-currently this produces a rate of about 29 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, a petroleum project incorporates the production licence area, and such treatment and other facilities and operations outside that area as are integral to the production of marketable petroleum commodities such as stabilised crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas. As a practical matter, two or more projects will be treated as a single project for tax purposes where the Minister for Resources and Energy, having regard to relevant factors, considers that they should be so treated and issues a certificate to that effect. The boundaries of a petroleum project will not extend beyond the first point at which a marketable petroleum commodity is produced, that is, the project boundaries will not extend to `downstream activities' such as refineries and facilities for the transport of marketable products. </PARA>
<PARA>Assessable Receipts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Liability for petroleum resource rent tax is to be assessed on a cash flow basis, as distinct from the accruals basis that generally applies in determining income tax liability. Assessable receipts from the project will, therefore, be taken into account in the financial year in which they are received. Assessable project receipts will include amounts received from the sale of petroleum or of a marketable petroleum commodity. In the event that a marketable petroleum commodity is not sold at the point at which it is produced, the market value-or a fair and reasonable value of the commodity-at that point will be treated as an assessable receipt of the project. The need to attribute a value could arise, for example, in the case of an integrated producer who both extracts crude oil and refines it. </PARA>
<PARA>Deductible Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure of either a capital or a revenue nature which is directly related to a petroleum project-again reflecting the cash-flow basis of the tax-will be deductible in the year of payment against any assessable receipts for the year. Any excess of deductible expenditure, other than closing-down expenditure, over assessable receipts at the end of a year will be compounded forward for deduction against receipts in future years. Deductible expenditure comprises exploration expenditure, general project expenditure and closing-down expenditure, subject to the exclusion of certain specific items of expenditure. Exploration expenditure consists, broadly, of expenditure, other than excluded expenditure, in an exploration permit area that is directly related to exploration for petroleum and will include expenditure on the recovery of petroleum and the production of a marketable commodity prior to the coming into force of a production licence. Exploration expenditure includes related expenditure on storage and processing facilities and on employee amenities. Exploration expenditure will be deductible against assessable receipts of any project established within the exploration permit area. Where there are two or more projects in a permit area, exploration expenditure deductible in a particular year is to be set off against the project that relates to the production licence which first came into force, then against subsequent projects producing assessable receipts in that year. Special rules apply where a production licence from one permit area is combined with a production licence from another permit area to form a single project. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the provisions of this Bill take into account the recently introduced retention lease system. Retention leases are of considerable benefit to the industry. They allow title to be held over a promising discovery for a number of years without insisting on any major ongoing exploration or development program in the area. To prevent potentially significant revenue losses arising from compounding of deductible amounts, exploration expenditure related to a retention lease area will be able to be offset only against projects in that area. Exploration expenditure in the rest of the permit area will not be deductible against a retention lease project. That expenditure, if incurred more than five years before the coming into force of a production licence in the retention lease area, will attract compounding at the gross domestic product deflator rate. </PARA>
<PARA> General project expenditure comprises expenditure in a production licence area, or combined production licence areas, on the establishment of a project and on recovering and producing a marketable petroleum commodity. It includes relevant expenditure on storage and processing facilities and employee amenities. Closing-down expenditure is made up of expenditure in closing down a petroleum project and specifically includes expenditure on environmental restoration of a project site. If, at the end of a project's life, there are insufficient assessable receipts for a year against which to offset closing-down expenditure for the year, a tax credit of 40 per cent of the excess expenditure is provided. Of course, closing-down credits in respect of a project will not be permitted to exceed the petroleum resource rent tax previously paid in respect of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain expenditure is specifically excluded from petroleum resource rent tax deductibility. Examples are interest payments and payments made under a cash bidding system. As petroleum resource rent tax is to be a deductible expense for income tax purposes, income tax payments are not to be deductible for resource rent tax purposes. Fringe benefits tax payments are also excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>Instalments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The practical operation of the Bill will require the payment of petroleum resource rent tax by instalments in any year in which a person's assessable receipts from a project exceed the deductible expenditure, including any compounded expenditure of previous years. Three instalments of tax will be payable-determined on the basis of assessable receipts and deductible expenditure in the instalment period and an appropriate proportion of compounded expenditure from previous years. The liability for tax assessed at the year's end will be reduced by earlier paid instalments for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains the usual machinery provisions of a tax law-dealing with such things as collection and recovery procedures-and provides objection and appeal rights for taxpayers dissatisfied with decisions under the proposed petroleum resource rent tax regime. Full details of the provisions of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable members. On the basis of current world oil prices, it is unlikely that any petroleum resource rent tax revenue will be received before the 1989-90 financial year. Due to the continuing fluctuations in world oil prices and the uncertainties inherent in predicting success in offshore petroleum exploration and subsequent production, the amount of revenue likely to be obtained in any year cannot be projected. I present the explanatory memorandum, and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The new profit-based taxing regime for offshore petroleum projects is, in respect of those projects, to replace the existing production-based excise and royalty arrangements. This Bill will amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Act 1967 to effect that replacement. The Bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide income tax deductibility for petroleum resource rent tax paid other than by way of instalments. Conversely, refunds and certain credits of petroleum resource rent tax are to be made subject to income tax. Decisions under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 will assume greater importance for the Commonwealth with the introduction of petroleum resource rent tax. That Act is therefore being amended by this Bill to provide for decisions relating to the development of petroleum pools straddling production licence areas, including pools which straddle the outer boundary of the territorial sea, to be taken jointly by the Minister for Resources and Energy and the relevant State or Northern Territory Minister. The scope of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 is also being extended by the Bill, so that offences against that Act will cover schemes for the fraudulent evasion of petroleum resource rent tax in the same way as they deal with other taxes of the Commonwealth. Details of this Bill are also set out in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to another of the measures in the Government's tax reform package by introducing an instalment system for the payment of provisional tax, and contains several other measures. One of these gives effect to the decision of the Government announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 18 February 1986 to treat as assessable income certain realised foreign exchange gains of a capital nature and to allow corresponding income tax deductions for foreign exchange losses. The Bill also contains a related amendment to the capital gains and losses provisions of the income tax law to exclude from those provisions foreign exchange gains and losses under certain hedging contracts. It will also implement the decision announced on 7 April 1986 to treat short term redeemable preference shares as debt for income tax purposes. Finally, the Bill will exempt from tax the income of the British Phosphate Commissioners' Banaba Contingency Fund. I will now outline in greater detail the proposals dealt with in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Instalments of Provisional Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will provide the legislative framework for the introduction from 1987-88 of a system for the payment of provisional tax by instalments. When the new system is fully implemented in 1988-89, taxpayers whose provisional tax for the previous year exceeds $2,000 will pay four instalments during the year in which the income is derived. The earliest due dates for the instalments will be 1 September, 1 December, 1 March and 1 June respectively. In the 1987-88 year, the earliest due date for the first instalment will be 1 December, when two quarterly instalments will be combined into one payment. The total amount of provisional tax paid by instalments in any year will generally equal the amount that would be payable under the current single payment system. </PARA>
<PARA> By spreading the payment of provisional tax in this way, provisional taxpayers will be brought more into line with salary and wage earners, whose incomes are subject to pay as you earn tax deductions at source. There are, of course, significant economic and monetary policy advantages in spreading provisional tax payments. The large seasonal fluctuations in liquidity that have been an annual concomitant of the concentration of provisional tax payments from late March through the June quarter will be diminished, with beneficial effects on short term interest rates and the exchange rate. As a general rule, each of the first three quarterly instalments will be one-quarter of the provisional tax payable in respect of the previous year's income. The final instalment will be calculated as the balance required to make up the taxpayer's full liability for provisional tax for that year, calculated in the same way as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a taxpayer `self-assesses' his or her provisional tax by making an estimate of taxable income, rebates, et cetera for the current year, instalments will be based on the taxpayer's estimate. An estimate may be made for each instalment, regardless of whether estimates have also been made in respect of earlier instalments. To ensure that estimates are reasonably based, penalty tax for substantial underestimates will be payable at the rate of 20 per cent per annum for the period of the underestimate. Taxpayers-for example, some primary producers-who do not derive income evenly throughout the year will be catered for by an alternative two instalment scheme under which one-half of the year's provisional tax will be payable no earlier than 1 February and the balance no earlier than 1 June. To qualify for this, a taxpayer must satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation that more than three-quarters of his or her assessable income will be derived after 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation contains special measures to counter possible exploitation of the two instalment arrangement. As at present, provisional tax instalments paid in respect of the income of a year of income will be credited against the actual tax payable on assessment. Where a taxpayer is required to pay instalments in a year of income, any balance of tax payable on an assessment for the previous year will be due for payment no earlier than 1 February. Because full details are provided in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated, I need not dwell further on the proposed system. While the measure is revenue neutral in that it will not increase provisional tax collections, it is estimated that collections of $90m will be brought forward to 1987-88. Depending on interest rate assumptions, it is also estimated that annual expenditure savings of up to $100m will result from the need to issue fewer Treasury notes. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In February this year the Treasurer announced the Government's decision to allow income tax deductions for foreign exchange losses of a capital nature and to treat as assessable income corresponding foreign exchange gains realised after 18 February 1986 in respect of borrowings or loans contracted for after that date. Equivalent treatment was foreshadowed for gains and losses resulting from exchange rate effects between the date of acquisition or sale of assets contracted for after 18 February 1986 and the payment or receipt of the purchase money, the time delay in payment being equivalent to a loan. The proposed amendments will mean that exchange gains and losses on borrowings or loans of a capital nature will be treated in the same way as such gains or losses on borrowings or loans of a revenue nature. As with such gains or losses on borrowings of a revenue nature, the amendments will apply only where the borrowings are for the purpose of producing assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clear economic advantages in treating all foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of borrowings and loans in the same way, given the economic similarity between interest payments and expected exchange rate effects over the period of a foreign currency-denominated debt contract. Consistent with this, foreign exchange losses incurred on a borrowing to finance a rental property investment are to be treated in the same way as interest payable on the loan for the purpose of the negative gearing provisions relating to rental property investments, and foreign exchange gains of this kind will be treated as rental property income. Exchange gains and losses under forward exchange contracts and other hedging contracts entered into to guard against exchange rate losses are to be treated as assessable income or allowable income tax deductions respectively in the same way as such gains and losses under the primary contract. For the purposes of the proposed measures, the contract date of each borrowing on or after 19 February 1986 under a drawdown facility contracted for before that date is to be treated as a borrowing under a contract made on the date of the drawdown. Corresponding treatment will be extended where a pre-19 February 1986 loan is rolled over, or extended, on or after that date. To avoid retrospective application, these measures are not to apply if the taxpayer was contractually bound before 19 February 1986 to make the drawdown, roll-over or extension. The Bill includes safeguards against use of these provisions for tax avoidance purposes. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bill also proposes a complementary amendment to the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to capital gains and capital losses. This will have the effect that those provisions will not apply to a capital gain made, or a capital loss incurred, under a hedging contract entered into to guard against currency rate fluctuations in relation to another contract, where any actual gains or losses from such fluctuations on that other contract would be outside the scope of the capital gains and losses provisions. The change will apply in respect of capital gains derived at any time after the commencement, on 20 September 1985, of the capital gains tax provisions. As regards capital losses it will apply only in respect of contracts entered into after today. This will ensure that taxpayers are not retrospectively denied a deduction for losses incurred under contracts already entered into. </PARA>
<PARA>Short Term Share Based Financing Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 7 April 1986, the Treasurer announced that the income tax law would be amended to remove the tax advantages arising from the use of short term redeemable preference shares as a substitute for debt. The Bill will give effect to that decision. Under the existing income tax law, interest on debt finance is generally deductible to the payer and taxable to the recipient. Dividends are not deductible to a paying company, but the rebate allowable on intercorporate dividends makes them free of tax in the hands of the company receiving them. This different tax treatment of dividends and interest has given rise to a number of share based financing arrangements designed to attract the taxation treatment of equity for what essentially amounts to debt, with a consequential loss to the revenue. The amendments contained in this Bill will ensure that dividends paid on shares used in arrangements for the provision of finance for a period of two years or less will be no longer eligible for the intercorporate dividend rebate. Reflecting the mischief described in the Treasurer's announcement, these measures are not confined to redeemable shares strictly so-called, but will apply to any shares used in a short term financing arrangement where it can reasonably be concluded that the dividend paid is equivalent to the payment of interest on a loan. Dividends that are denied a rebate of tax by these amendments will be deductible to the paying company, subject to the same rules that govern the deduction of interest on borrowings. Trustees of corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts that are treated as companies for income tax purposes will also be subject to these new measures. The amendments will apply to dividends paid on relevant shares issued after 5 p.m. Australian eastern standard time on 7 April 1986. Safeguarding provisions will ensure that these amendments are not circumvented by the use of shares issued before the operative time in a short term financing arrangement entered into after that time. The revenue saving arising from these measures is indeterminate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Banaba Contingency Fund</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the income tax law to exempt from tax the income of the British Phosphate Commissioners' Banaba Contingency Fund. The Fund was established on 1 June 1981 to meet any future claims for compensation by former employees of the British Phosphate Commissioners in respect of phosphate mining operations on Banaba, formerly Ocean Island. Those operations ceased in 1980. Income of the British Phosphate Commissioners, as representatives of the Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom governments, is exempt from tax under the doctrine of sovereign immunity and, if the commissioners were in a position to administer the Fund, income of the Fund would also be exempt. However, the affairs of the Commissioners are in the process of being wound up. The amendment proposed in this Bill will provide the exemption that would otherwise be available for the Contingency Fund. It will apply to income derived by the Fund from its inception on 1 June 1981. The cost of providing the exemption is estimated at $50,000 in a full year. A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Australian Stock Exchange and National Guarantee Fund Bill provides legislative support for a restructuring of the existing capital city based structure of stock exchanges by the establishment of a single national stock exchange. It also enhances investor protection by establishing a national guarantee fund which will provide no fault contract guarantees for investors on Australian exchanges and protection for those investors in respect of dealer insolvencies. I am introducing this Bill pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. In accordance with the formal agreement under that scheme, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has approved introduction of the Bill into this Parliament. The measures I have just outlined will be achieved by amendment of the Securities Industry Act 1980. Consequential amendments will also be made to other co- operative scheme legislation. The impetus for change to the structure of the major Australian stock exchanges has come from the stock exchanges themselves. The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges formally requested legislative support for the change from the Ministerial Council in March 1986. Such support is required because of the significant logistic and timing difficulties inherent in separate schemes of arrangement in each State which would otherwise be necessary to facilitate the desired restructuring. It is worth noting briefly the sorts of developments in Australia which have prompted Australian stock exchanges to adopt a more national focus. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major developments in Australia and throughout the world's capital and securities markets has been the trend to internationalisation of securities markets. This has been stimulated by technological advances in communication, increasing sophistication of investors in the management of their financial risks and, of course, this Government's initiatives in abolishing exchange controls as part of its general policy of deregulating the financial system. Accordingly, Australian stock exchanges have been subject to greater competition from overseas exchanges. This development alone suggests that Australia's current fragmented State based stock exchange system is inappropriate. There is also increasing pressure from investors for a national clearing house and depository system to speed up transfer of securities and for the adoption of screen trading. These trends also serve to highlight the need for a more streamlined and integrated system for trading securities and raising capital in Australia. The associated establishment of a national guarantee fund to replace the existing separate fidelity funds of each of the State capital city exchanges will assist in maintaining investor confidence in Australian securities markets. The no fault contract guarantees will ensure that, where a party to a securities transaction does not complete his obligations, those obligations will be met by the National Guarantee Fund. This no fault system of contract guarantees contrasts with claims against existing fidelity funds under the provisions of Part IX of the Securities Industry Act 1980 where defalcation or fraudulent misuse of property is required to establish a claim. Direct access to the National Guarantee Fund for compensation in respect of a dealer insolvency also contrasts with existing fidelity fund provisions which only allow for compensation via formal Bankruptcy Act mechanisms. In addition to these investor protection measures, the establishment of the National Guarantee fund will enable funds to be made available for industry development purposes approved by the Ministerial Council. These funds will comprise the amount of the pooled assets not required for investor protection purposes and it is envisaged that one of the purposes for which such funds will be used is the establishment of a centralised clearing house and depository system. </PARA>
<PARA>Contents of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposals in slightly more detail. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Stock Exchange Ltd</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill incorporates the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd, ASX, in the Australian Capital Territory as a body corporate limited by guarantee. The existing capital city exchanges will become wholly owned subsidiaries of ASX and their members will cease membership of their particular exchanges and become members of ASX. ASX will be responsible for all listing on main board markets while its subsidiaries will continue to be responsible for their second board, options and futures markets. The State subsidiaries will, however, exercise powers and perform a number of functions delegated to them by ASX. For example, they will, at least in the short term, operate the main board markets on behalf of ASX. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 also provides for the transfer of assets from existing capital city exchanges to ASX on these exchanges becoming subsidiaries. This reflects the transfer of main board listing and membership functions to ASX. </PARA>
<PARA>National Guarantee Fund</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 of the Bill establishes the National Guarantee Fund, which will provide investor protection in two ways. First, it will guarantee the performance of all reportable transactions in securities quoted on Australian stock exchanges. Claims against the Fund will be able to be made by a selling or buying dealer in respect of default by his counterpart dealer in the transaction and by clients in respect of default by the dealer who is selling or buying on their behalf. Secondly, the Fund will compensate investors for pecuniary and property loss as a result of the insolvency of a broker member of the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will not have any financial impact on government revenue and expenditure. Sharemarket investors will benefit from the contract guarantee and insolvency provisions of the National Guarantee Fund. The capital and securities market is expected to become more efficient from the more co-ordinated, centralised Australian Stock Exchange approach. In addition, allocation of excess funds of the National Guarantee Fund to national development purposes approved by Ministerial Council should allow technological advances with resulting efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill assists the stock exchanges in their attempt to establish a more co-ordinated nationally oriented securities market and provides additional investor protection to maintain confidence in that market. I commend the Bill to the House. I also present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my statement which I tabled with the report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on the Ranger uranium water management system on 16 October I said that uranium mining is a controversial issue, particularly if the mine is surrounded by a national park of World Heritage status. Media reports over recent years have alleged that the operations of Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd were defective and that the proposals of the company relating to water releases were not in the best interests of the environment. Naturally, the Committee appointed by this House to monitor environmental matters could not ignore the statements and headlines such as `Ranger crisis: Option to put Tailings into Creek', and `Atom Deluge threatens Park', and reports of numerous incidents relating to the tailings pipeline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Committee agreed to undertake informal investigations into the environmental aspects relating to the water management at Ranger. The Committee decided to report on two issues and two issues only, namely, failures in the tailings pipeline and the Ranger's proposal to release water from its restricted release zone into the Magela Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the report was tabled the Committee has received comments from sections of the conservation movement criticising the manner in which we conducted our investigations. Of concern to the conservation movement was that the Committee did not consult widely enough, nor did it cover all the issues relating to Ranger's water management system. I believe the Committee was justified in concentrating on the two issues of pipeline failure and water release. The Committee's investigations were a direct result of public concern relating to these two issues. There were many other areas which were of concern to individual members of the Committee, such as worker health and safety, industrial relations, and other aspects of Ranger's operations, but it was agreed that the report should be restricted to these two aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> It was important that our report be available before a decision was made relating to water release. This urgency precluded widespread consultation which may have occurred had the Committee conducted a formal inquiry. The Committee limited its discussions with the conservation movement to the Northern Territory Environment Centre. We had no reason to doubt the competence of this organisation to discuss with the Committee the two matters under consideration. Notwithstanding these comments, it appears from the correspondence received that if the Committee had consulted more widely its conclusions would have been no different. The Committee report was the result of informal discussions and inspections rather than the result of an extensive formal inquiry. The Committee has adopted this approach on a number of occasions in the past when resource and time constraints have made this method of operation necessary. We have never before been criticised. If the Committee were to conduct formal inquiries into each of the many environmental issues upon which we comment, limited member time and limited secretarial resources would make it difficult to table even one report each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to cover all the issues included in my statement of 16 October because there are other speakers who want to talk about the report. There are, however, a number of issues which I wish to highlight now. While it is apparent that the numerous and regular leakages from the tailings pipeline have had no adverse impact on Kakadu National Park these occurrences are reasons for concern. The Committee cannot accept that a company which is located within an area of such significant environmental value and which claims to be as efficient as the most regulated of any operation in the world should have allowed the number of incidents which have occurred. The Committee understands that the tailings pipeline has been replaced. Should these regular, accidental releases continue the Committee would support the cessation of operations until such time as the system was rectified. However, the Committee accepts the Supervising Scientist's assessment that there has been no discernible adverse impact from these incidents on the surrounding park or in the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Organisations have argued that Ranger has little regard for the environment and operates on a least cost basis. There are a number of examples which may support this view. During our inspections the Committee observed the state of the sulphur dump, exposed and decaying bags of chemicals at the water treatment plant, and the trial dry tailings plot unfenced with animal footprints in the tailings. The decision by mine management to import on to the site about one million cubic metres of water in excess of requirements during 1982 suggested a lack of concern about the longer term environmental consequences should rainfall return to normal in the following seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Ranger is developing a water management policy which will include releases of water to the Magela Creek. Such releases, Ranger argues, may be necessary in some years to enable the company to gain access to the mine pit at the end of the wet season. Such releases would not be regular occurrences and may not even occur once in 20 years. The company has emphasised that the releases would be of mildly contaminated water and not tailings dam water as some sections of the media have suggested and could be made only when the Magela was in flood in accordance with water release criteria developed by the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist holds the view that on technical grounds occasional controlled discharges of water to the Magela could be made in such a way that there would be virtually no damage to the environment, including no harm to people. On balance the Office of the Supervising Scientist believes that water released in the Magela should be accepted as one of the water disposal components of Ranger's water management system. This view is supported by the Northern Territory supervising authorities. On the other hand, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife advises that it is unaware of the environmental impact of direct release, but believes that there are still too many unknowns for assurances to be given that there will be no impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Land Council argues that traditional owners believed that Ranger would operate on a no-release system, and failure to achieve this objective can result only in an unacceptable social impact. The Northern Land Council points to adverse biological reactions within the creek when water, which was less contaminated than that now under consideration, was released last year. The conservation movement supports the NLC's attitude. The Committee notes in its report that, in the development of a water management system, Ranger is required by its mining agreement to take account of the social effects of its operations. This indicates that the views of the traditional owners must be respected in developing this water management system. The Committee considered in great detail the question of release. Some members, including me, are not satisfied that there will be no adverse environmental impact. Neither the Northern Territory officials nor the Office of the Supervising Scientist were able to give 100 per cent assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the report, Ranger imported huge quantities of water on to the site and then experienced two seasons of unusually high rainfall. Despite these problems, Ranger was able to operate without water release, and the system is now in balance. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, commonly known as the Fox inquiry, believed that ideally the water management system should be based on non-release of contaminants and that this system be maintained until it is shown that releases of contaminated water have to be made. It is the Committee's view, irrespective of individual attitudes on the impact of the release of water on the Kakadu wetlands, that it has not been established that the release of water to the Magela needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in the findings of the Committee has led me to change my personal view that it was a disgracefully irresponsible decision of the Liberal-National Party Government to allow mining operations to commence in an area of such great environmental sensitivity as Kakadu. In this respect, it is most commendable that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment (Mr Cohen) introduced into the House yesterday a Bill which will prevent exploration and mining on land proclaimed as the Kakadu National Park and which provides that no compensation is to be payable by the Commonwealth. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their initiative which is welcomed by conservation organisations around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation has a lot of sensitivity associated with it, particularly with regard to the Kakadu National Park. It is a report with which I am very glad to be associated because, being as sensitive as it has been and is, it is really gratifying-in fact, it is quite remarkable-to think that the Standing Committee comprising members from both sides of the House was able to bring forward a unanimous report. I mention that because it is something pleasant to say about it. I was disappointed that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) sought to make his speech a little political in his criticisms of former governments and their relationships with activities in that part of Australia. Even though the report was unanimous, as the honourable member for La Trobe has pointed out there were differences in relation to a number of aspects of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As he pointed out, the Committee's investigation was made as a result of Press and conservationists' comments relating to the operations of Ranger. Whilst I would not argue against the right of conservationists to hold their views, there seemed to be a misunderstanding, and maybe even a deliberate attempt to influence the opinion of this Committee. These influences, I am afraid, were not based on fact. Quite a few emotional comments were made in the Press on a number of occasions in regard to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The minor differences between Committee members related to the impact of the release of water from RP2. It is interesting because I find it very difficult to see how there can be any controversy over water that has been tested repeatedly and found to be quite adequate for drinking and even of a better quality than Adelaide's drinking water. I am not casting aspersions on the Adelaide water supply. The Office of the Supervising Scientist was set up in association with the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. To date, that Office has spent $25m of taxpayers' money to show almost conclusively, although it has not given a 100 per cent assurance, that there will be no ill effects from the discharge of RP2 water into Magela Creek. So $25m of taxpayers' money has been well spent. The most minute inquiries have been conducted into the various effects on the local ecosystems of the Magela Creek and other streams. No significant evidence has come forward to show how the natural system that operates will be affected by the discharge of this water. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that with the first rains the water that ran off the area where the very diluted RP2 water would be going was much more highly concentrated in terms of its chemical composition than anything that would be discharged, with permission, from the Ranger uranium mine. Also, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for La Trobe, it is interesting that the Ranger Uranium Mine Pty Ltd imported one million cubic metres of water to help it with its problems in that regard. This was followed by two seasons of heavy rainfall, but the mine was still able to operate without any water release. This is one of the major reasons why the Committee felt that it was unnecessary to come to any agreement with regard to allowing water from the RP2 pond to be discharged into Magela Creek. It was proposed that, if water were to be discharged from RP2 into the Magela, it would be discharged at the peak period of six or seven weeks in which great volumes of water flow into the creek. That would make it 100 per cent safe. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned those things in relation to this report, although many more could be mentioned. I think it ought to be said that the fact that the Ranger operation exists in the park has enabled the park to be opened up to tourists. We now have a sealed road to Kakadu-the Arnhem Highway. There is an excellent airstrip at Jabiru which, it could be argued, would not be there and the area would not have been opened up to the tourist industry if it had not been for the Ranger operation. Also it could be argued that, if it had not been for mining and the Fox inquiry, the park may not have been established to the point to which it has been. Many tourists, including many Australians, who have every right to be in that park and to enjoy its beauty, would be missing out on seeing this unique area. I think the Ranger operation demonstrates how conservation values and tightly controlled mining operations are compatible, although I would not support in any way any uncontrolled development in the region. Finally, I commend the report to the House. I also commend the Standing Committee's secretariat, under the leadership of Mr John Cummins, for the excellent assistance that it has given us, and I congratulate it on the speed with which the report was completed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, on behalf of the Chairman and all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I would like to thank the secretariat for the excellent work that it has done in helping us and assisting us to compile this report. Before I get on to the report itself I would like to mention to the nation exactly what Ranger is. I think this is most important. Many people do not realise that it is a company called Energy Resources of Australia Ltd and that Ranger is a subsidiary company. The directors are: Mr Morokoff, Mr Copeman, Mr Ito, Mr Mueller, Mr Bethwaite, Mr Hamer, Mr Lean and Sir Rupert Myers. One of the names to look at is Mr Copeman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we read further in the company listing we learn of the history of Energy Resources of Australia. It was incorporated as a proprietary company in the Australian Capital Territory on 8 February 1980. It received public status on 11 July 1980. The company was formed to acquire all rights to the Ranger project which in 1969 was discovered to have a major uranium ore body. The company was a new flotation and is owned by Peko-Wallsend Ltd. The Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd owns 31.8 per cent, overseas equity participants own 24.2 per cent and the general public own 14.2 per cent. The main names to look at in the list of those who actually own this company are Mr Copeman and that particularly notorious company called Peko-Wallsend. I am quite certain that honourable members are aware that Peko-Wallsend was the company which owned Besco Batteries and which sacked over 300 people, giving them only 30 minutes notice. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the sort of company that owns the Ranger uranium mine. It is a very aggressive company. It was also involved in the Robe River dispute where people were just dismissed and locked out, and it has taken a very high profile in the New Right in Australia. Mr Copeman has been very active in making certain that this company's views are well known. When we arrived at Ranger one of the first things I noticed as we went through the gate was a huge board listing all the injuries and accidents that had happened over the past month or so, and there was one for every day. I have worked in heavy industry and I know what it is like. A lot of accidents happen, but never before had I seen a safety record as bad as the record of that company. </PARA>
<PARA> When we went to have a look around-it was not as if we went there as a surprise team or anything like that-I thought the company could have taken a little time to clean up the place and make it look as though it was a reasonably run sort of organisation. However, as the Chairman of the Committee has mentioned, a huge pile of sulphur was just spread all over the ground and the tractors had gone into it. Sulphur, which is used in the processing of uranium, was just spread everywhere. Other bags containing chemicals were just out in the open. The paper had worn off and these chemicals had run all over the ground. There were forty-four gallon drums which were all rusty and leaking, and plastic containers of ferric chloride were also just out in the open. Ferric chloride is a very highly corrosive acid. I used to make printed circuit boards and I used to use ferric chloride actually to remove the copper plating on the backs of these boards. It is very corrosive, but it was just lying around there. As has been mentioned, there had also been reports about pipeline breakages and spillages. Even though this particular company makes a profit of only $1m a week it had actually cut out a section where the pipe had broken and put back in the old, worn pipe. These sorts of practices are unbelievable. These sorts of things do not go on in heavy industry. But this company, in its quest for more money, more wealth-more greed-just wanted to use as little as possible in the way of supplies and material to ensure that it would make a profit for itself and its shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Peko-Wallsend has a unique position in Australia. Ranger is the only large uranium mine which is allowed to exist in the tropics and that company should look after it. It is not looking after the land on which it has its lease. This is wrong. I have pointed out in a speech on the adjournment debate the various problems that I noticed in the short time that I was there. I do not know whether the company has taken any steps to counteract or repair these problems but I doubt that very much. I think all it is interested in is causing disruption within the Australian system and the Parliament by its recent aggressive actions. Honourable members would all be aware that Peko-Wallsend went into the Kakadu National Park and defied the Federal Government and the national park concept by exploring and bringing to a climax its right wing profit-motivated views to try to get more money and to try to open up this beautiful area of Australia so that it could get in there and ruin it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not completely against mining. I believe that mining has a very important place in Australia. But a lot of these assets in Kakadu do not have to be mined now. No doubt they will be mined in the future by some sort of machinery-let us say robots-which will dig underneath the ground and will not destroy the national park. I can see this happening, but now is not the time to do it. We should leave these minerals in the ground. They are an asset and they will not go away. People are so concerned about the mining of uranium and gold, et cetera. I have never known minerals such as gold really to come down in price. I think gold will always be expensive as it is getting rarer and rarer. We have a great asset there. It is money in the bank and, with inflation, it will go up all the time. People should look at these sorts of things and stop being so greedy. They should stop thinking of just today and think of the future, especially the future of our children who want to go and have a look at this beautiful area. I have been there several times. I am very fortunate as I have seen it, but I want my kids and their kids to see it in its pristine state, or as near to that state as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish, as I do quite a bit, with a nice little poem from a book entitled `Kakadu Man' written by Bill Neidjie. I think he was recently in Canberra promoting this book. The poem which I have chosen is short and I think it explains the true feeling and empathy that Aboriginals have for the land. I only wish that white people had this same feeling and love for our country. The poem is entitled simply `Land'. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes a continuation of the bounty assistance on Australian book production for the next three years until 30 June 1989. It replaces the current bounty legislation which is due to terminate on 31 December 1986. Bounties have been paid on certain Australian book production since 1969 in order to assist the Australian printing industry compete with overseas book printers. This particular industry is assisted by means of a bounty because, although not a signatory, the Government adheres to the spirit of the Florence Agreement, which precludes the imposition of tariffs on books containing educational, scientific or cultural material. </PARA>
<PARA> The assistance arrangements for the next three years follow the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations contained in its report No. 377 of 20 December 1985 on book production. In its report the IAC concluded that the sector of book production activity which is assisted receives a level of assistance comparable with that available to other assisted printing activity, but at a high level by comparison with assistance generally afforded other manufacturing activities. The Commission was of the view that assistance to book production should be provided in a manner which, as far as possible, allows the structure of the industry to respond to changes in market conditions, technology, and other factors, unencumbered by government direction. It said that the high level of assistance applying to most categories should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The main recommendations contained in the Commission's report were that:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Bounty on eligible books be reduced from 25 to 20 per cent of net selling price, that is, the selling price less the bounty;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Bounty on paper supplied free of charge by publishers to printers for the production of bountiable books be reduced from 20 to 16 2/3 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Bounty eligibility be extended to Australian directories, guides, street directories, road guides and the like and Customs duties for those books to which bounty is extended be at minimum rates; and</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Customs duties on other books dutiable at 25 per cent be reduced to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has accepted the basic thrust of the recommendations of the Commission. However, it has decided to defer the reduction in bounty rates until it has had time to consider the current wide ranging inquiry on the pulp, paper, paper products and printing industries being conducted by the IAC. The Commission's final report is due in February 1987. Book production is included within this inquiry as it is an integral part of the printing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It has, however, been decided to vary the bounty rate in accordance with the decision announced in the 1986-87 Budget to reduce bounties generally by 20 per cent. Clause 11 of the Bill therefore provides that under the new scheme eligible books are to be paid a bounty of 20 per cent of the printer's net selling price, that is, the selling price less the bounty. Further, in circumstances where publishers supply paper free of charge to printers for the production of bountiable books the bounty rate is to be 16 2/3 per cent of the publisher's material costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided that bounty eligibility is to be extended to include Australian guides and directories. The exclusion of these goods from the previous bounty scheme has caused considerable administrative problems for the Australian Customs Service and confusion within the industry. Books published by the Australian Government Publishing Service and books required to be published or printed by State or Territory government printers after 1 January 1987 will no longer be eligible for bounty. This is for the reason that government publications are usually printed in Australia and are not subject to competition from overseas printers. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to simplify the administration of the scheme clause 14 of the Bill provides that only one bounty claim per production run will be allowed. The claim can be lodged by either the publisher or the printer but a minimum value of $200 per title per production run will apply. It is worth mentioning that imported typesetting in any pre-printed plate form will not disqualify an otherwise eligible publication from bounty. Likewise, books using imported colour separations will continue to be eligible for bounty. The cost of any process carried out overseas is, however, to be excluded from bounty calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill provides that books which, if imported, would be classifiable to a tariff item on which Customs duty is payable will not be eligible for bounty. This is proposed to avoid the possibility of a locally produced book being assisted by both a bounty and a tariff. The Government has also decided that import duties on books currently dutiable at a general rate of 25 per cent will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill contains provisions which update the previous legislation to improve administrative effectiveness, in line with similar provisions recently introduced in other subsidy and bounty legislation. The Government is committed to maintaining a healthy and viable book industry in Australia. We believe that the Bill provides the necessary ingredients upon which the industry can build, and provides the industry with an appropriate level of assistance pending the outcome of the Government's decision on its wide ranging review of assistance for the whole paper and printing industries. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Bounty payments to the book printing industry totalled $18.8m in 1985-86. Bounty payments for the six months to June 1987 are expected to be $6.3m and in 1987-88 $12.7m. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill proposes to extend the bounty on book production for the next three years from 1 January 1987 to 30 June 1989. The Government has reversed its earlier decision to reduce the bounty from 25 per cent to 16 per cent, a fall made up of a 20 per cent Budget cut and a 20 per cent reduction recommended earlier by the Industries Assistance Commission. Now only the Budget cut will be implemented, at least until the Industries Assistance Commission delivers its final report on the pulp, paper and printing industries, an inquiry which includes book production. The Budget decision to cut the bounty from 25 to 20 per cent of costs angered not only printing and publishing companies but also those keen to encourage cultural independence through Australian written and published books. As I said earlier, the recommendation came from the Industries Assistance Commission, but what has particularly angered local printers is that the book bounty cut would have been followed by another cut in all government bounties scheduled for 1 January 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose this Bill, but we would like to make a few comments about the method whereby this Bill has had to be brought back to the House. We will be moving an amendment in Committee on the question of orderly development of the industry. Our main criticism relates to uncertainty. What business needs above all is an environment of certainty-certainty in government industry policies and certainty in taxation policies-and in general an economic framework that enables business to make decisions on investment. As we all know, Australia is way short of a proper level of private investment and, worse still, that private investment has been falling. It is private investment, with the jobs it creates and the wealth it provides to the community, that is the engine of economic growth. Although the Government has been saying for some time how well it has done in terms of providing jobs, I should just point out that there is the same number of unemployed people in Australia now as there was in March 1983. So private investment is falling and, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said yesterday, if Australia cannot get its economic act together, if it cannot create an environment in which private investment will start to rise, the country will stagnate and become an economic backwater. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, what has the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) done? With virtually one stroke of the pen, by the Budget decision, he has destroyed his credibility with business and made business uncertain. When business is uncertain, it does not invest. All bounties were reduced in the Budget by 20 per cent. It is incredible that the Minister, who is alleged to be one of the more sensible Ministers in the Government, would lend his name to that decision which has created so much uncertainty for business and has produced an environment in which it is difficult for business to plan appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA> The book printing business has made a solid and strong effort to become competitive, and it has made the investments necessary to ensure that it can compete with imports. The industry has tried very hard. As I said earlier, it was angered by this so-called double whammy-the implementation of the IAC recommendation and the Budget cut. This Bill tries to twist and turn to get around the Budget decision by deferring the recommendations of the IAC report. As the Minister has said, the main recommendation was that the bounty on eligible books be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of net selling price-that is, the selling price less the bounty. This Bill seeks to extend that bounty by three years. By this wriggling and extending the bounty for three years the Government has got around the problem that it created for itself with its Budget decision. We condemn the Government for its double standards and its attempt to cover up its bad Budget decision with the device contained in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Bounty (Books) Bill 1986 with a great deal of pleasure. I will disclose to the nation a little-known fact about my history. I have printers ink in my veins, and it goes back a long way. My maternal great-grandfather was one John Bedford Leno, who was a Chartist. He was a founder of the first printing guild in the United Kingdom. In the late 1800s he was a member of a guild which was the beginning of the first unions. He was also in the Chartist Movement, which applied for the right of women to vote and began many other great legislative moves in those days. He was one of the group that brought Garibaldi to London in the late 1800s. So my printing background goes back a long way. I have been a printer in my time, and years ago I used to sell offset printing equipment. I assure honourable members that I still have that ink in my veins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to bring to the notice of the public some facts about the Australian printing industry, which this Bill affects greatly. It is most important that people be aware of these facts. Taken together the printing, publishing and allied industries constitute the fourth largest manufacturing industry in Australia. In the early 1980s it operated more than 2,500 establishments with some 76,000 employees. The annual growth rate of printing and publishing is about equal to the gross national product, and somewhat above the total non-agricultural product. The printing industry in Australia, as in most other countries, is highly skilled and is equally fragmented. That is good. I would hate to see it all controlled in a few hands. It consists of a large number of firms each producing only a small proportion of the total output. Fewer than 20 per cent of all printing companies produce some 80 per cent of the total production. With the advent of new technology, one can buy an Apple computer with the appropriate software program and a laser printer and set up one's own printing works. The dissemination of information and different views is important in these days of mass media. I am pleased that even though that particular side of the industry will not help printers, it will make certain that information is not just spread around by a few people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on what a book is. Often people take no notice of what they are looking at; they do not give books any thought. A book is a system of portable written or printed sheets held together and protected by a cover. The origin of the word `book' is derived from a Teutonic term meaning a charter or tablet. Books are a form of documentation whose earliest roots can be traced to the ancient civilisations of the Sumerians, Babylonians and Egyptians. The Sumerians used a series of wedge shaped characters imprinted in clay tablets. The clay tablets were baked, and the information contained on them was in a numerical sequence to indicate order. The papyrus reed was used by the ancient Egyptians, and in effect that method was used for many hundreds of years. The rise of alphabetic writing in around 1500 BC in Syria-Palestine and its consequent spread through Phoenician inscriptions added a more compact dimension to the documentation and record keeping contained on scrolls. The idea of a protective covering on books emerged with books that had wooden tablets attached at a hinge with leather thongs to protect the writing contained inside. Simple things are books, but they can form a great impression on people and they can do many things for many people. One of the reasons I am a member of this House at present is contained in the writings of William Shakespeare. A couple of lines in Hamlet triggered off something in me that made me move into the political arena. Those lines were written many hundreds of years ago, they were recorded in a book and to some extent they led me to my position today. I want to read to the House a few little quotes about books. Thomas Carlyle said that books are all `that mankind has done, thought, gained or been'; that `they are the chosen possession of men'. We could add `women' to that. The quotes continue:</PARA>
<PARA> A book may be as great a thing as a battle. </PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA> Books are the food which develops the intellect, character and personality, for in all good literature there is truth, wisdom and imagination. </PARA>
<PARA>These quotes are very important. Years ago I was a probation officer and I went into many houses. One of the things I noticed was that there were no books. I go into houses today and there are not many books. I am afraid that people are being conditioned just to watch television. That is not right. We should set aside a period just for reading, to absorb knowledge and get involved with what books are all about. This Bill assists our printing industry, and it assists the workers in the printing industry. It assists our industry to become more competitive in overseas markets, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 19, page 19, omit sub-clause (11). </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition proposes to attempt to amend the Bounty (Books) Bill by omitting sub-clause (11) from clause 19, which appears on page 19 of the Bill. That sub-clause presently reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Where an applicant for registration under this section was not, on 1 January 1987, engaged in carrying out the printing of bountiable books at premises in Australia or in publishing bountiable books so printed, the Comptroller shall not register that person if the Minister has informed the Comptroller that the registration of that person will not permit the orderly development in Australia of the industry comprising the production of bountiable books. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition seeks to omit that sub-clause because we believe that it represents an interference in people's freedom of choice to decide whether they should participate in that industry. Any orderly development clause simply is an excuse for more government interference and an excuse not to permit the market to determine the outcome. It is market forces that really give the best results for the consumers. No question of coercion is involved. That sub-clause is unnecessary. The type of action that is contemplated by the addition of that sub-clause always has unintended consequences. It is an infringement of people's right to compete. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects the amendment. I have some sympathy for the general point made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale). We are not a madly interventionist or regulatory government. But I think we have to recognise that the book industry is a bit of an anomaly. It is not exactly the same as, to take examples at random, the textile, clothing and footwear industries. Basically, in producing a certain volume of underpants, we can be pretty sure that in the course of a 12-month period we go through them-if honourable members will excuse the expression. But, in the case of an industry such as books, purely market considerations would lead us to say: `The only kind of books we are interested in are those that will be good sellers'. We would have a diminished industry and the books would have a smaller contribution to make to the Australian scene. Books are very hazardous business. I suppose any accountant would say to booksellers: `You would be very wise to stock up on Barbara Cartland and Harold Robbins and stick to them; stick to the proven selling lines', like the bookshops we have at airports--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I know that the whole question of orderly marketing implies the sort of thing that the National Party of Australia might have put up under earlier regimes for marketing of primary products. I do not really see this matter in that way. I put it to the honourable member for Deakin-and I am sure he will recognise this-that the discretion will be exercised, as the word suggests, with discretion. It will not be done to push the industry around. It is really intended to assist. The view the Government takes is that, in this case, for the reasons that I have just advanced, there ought to be a discretion, on the understanding that any discretion exercised by the Minister will be used appropriately, but not all the time. The discretion does not exclude new entrants to an industry from receiving the bounty, nor does it unfairly entrench existing bounty recipients. Provided that new entrants are prepared to undertake the necessary commitment to the industry and meet the registration requirements, they will not be denied registration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had some literary history from the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) earlier. It was going through my head as he was speaking that the standard Sanskrit dictionary, produced, I think, in 1816 by the Oxford University Press, has not exhausted its original print run. Accountants would have gone bananas at the investment that was put into it then. Nevertheless, we say that the publication has been worth while; a contribution to knowledge. The famous book by Copernicus that revealed the operation of the solar system was not exactly a best seller. We must recognise that, if we are to develop a strong book industry, a tremendous number of titles must come out. There has to be assistance and a degree of discretion. So, with infinite regret, we reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation into the Ranger Uranium Water Management system was unanimous. I was concerned that the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) made comments that were more of a political nature than about the report. I would like to deal with some of the honourable member's remarks. He regarded Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd as being greedy and shortsighted. In this day and age there needs to be a more realistic approach to environmental matters as well as to export earnings. The two must be kept in balanced perspective. I make these comments to try to give some balance to the perspective put upon this report by the member for Dunkley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, companies in Australia are established to make money-that is their purpose-so that Australia and Australian workers can benefit. I believe that Ranger has done a quite good job, given the circumstances which it has faced. I would remind the honourable member for Dunkley that the first point set out in the conclusion of the report says this about Ranger Uranium:</PARA>
<PARA> During the inspections of the project area the company was open and forthright in its discussions and allowed access to all areas within the project area including those areas where the Committee may have reached conclusions critical of the company's operations. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the company was very open to our going there and inspecting its operations and was quite prepared to sit down and talk with us. There was no notion that it did not want to talk to us, and therefore the comments by the honourable member for Dunkley were unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few other comments about the report. The environmental groups and the National Parks and Wildlife Service believe, without any good scientific evidence, that if water were released there would be concerns and changes in the environment. This raises the question of making decisions of this type in Australia at this stage. We are now in a scientific age, and if, as the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) has mentioned, the Government pays $25m to the Supervising Scientist and then virtually ignores what he is saying, I think we have very big problems with getting the right information on which to make decisions about the future of companies, mining and many other operations in this nation. We cannot go back to the era when we made decisions on emotions. If science is about one thing, it is about finding out to the best of mankind's ability what the facts are. This is what the Supervising Scientist said about the operations at Ranger Uranium:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist view is that on technical grounds occasional controlled discharges of RRZ water to the Magela could be made in such a way that there would be virtually no damage to the environment including no harm to people. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to refer to other possibilities of handling the water problem at Ranger and said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, such measures would be expensive and have associated with them their own environmental impact. On balance the OSS believes that water release to the Magela should be accepted as one of the water disposal components of long term best practice technology. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the advice of the people in charge of gathering the facts. In these matters it is very important to have an open mind to the facts which are laid before committees. On those facts we should make these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a few comments about the pipeline breakdowns. People regard these breakdowns as great catastrophes, particularly when they read the reports in the media. I am concerned because this shows that many people in Australia have very little understanding of the complexities of big factories and industries in this country. In fact, it is not a simple operation to ensure that these factories or mining sites operate at 100 per cent efficiency every day of the year. Therefore, I believe that we should view breakdowns in this light. Let us remember that the pipeline breakdown did not put any material of any concern outside the zone. The Australian people need to know that the material did not go out into the national park at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I believe it is important to keep up consultations with the people who live in the area and who are concerned about the possibility of damaging effects. No matter what we do in regard to mining operations in sensitive areas of Australia, we must keep in mind the interests of the Aboriginal people, particularly in this region. I believe that communication and continued discussions with Aboriginal people is a very important process. These people are concerned-and rightly so-about their environment because it is where they have lived for hundreds of years. If groups of people are to work together in this great nation of ours on these very delicate and sensitive matters, we should take account of the Aboriginal people's views. I would encourage the Ranger people to maintain contact with the Aboriginal people so that consultation continues in the future. I believe this report to be an honest assessment of the situation in Kakadu. It is not a report on which we should score political points. I believe that in future it will be regarded as a report which looked at the facts carefully and came down unanimously with a fair assessment of the situation at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and I wish to offer my congratulations to the secretariat for the excellent work it always does for us on this Committee. It is a great privilege to be a member of the Committee and to see so many of the beautiful parts of Australia. I must say that in preparing this report we saw something pretty horrific; nothing quite prepared me-even with my well known hostility to the uranium industry-for the shock of seeing this awful mining operation, surrounded by beautiful country. I am unashamedly hostile to the industry and with very good reason. There are so many unresolved problems which surround the whole nuclear industry and these problems are acknowledged by everyone. The nuclear industry is touted so often as clean, cheap, efficient and necessary and of course it is none of these. The complications and the acknowledged problems start with the mining of uranium. Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd mines uranium under very strict conditions, but the problems cannot all be foreseen and the onus is on the company to make sufficient provision to cope with any problem that arises. In the uranium mining industry any problems that do arise can have pretty alarming consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Water management is one of the problems that Ranger must face and the company must make provision to cope with any problem arising there. The company's record is not very good. Paragraph 82 of the Committee's report says this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee cannot accept that a Company which is located within an area of significant environmental value, claims to be as efficient as any operation in the world and claims to be one of the most regulated in the world, should have allowed the number of incidents to have occurred as have been reported in the annual reports of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Committee understands that the tailings pipeline has now been replaced. </PARA>
<PARA>That was another matter of concern that was brought to our attention. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Should these regular accidental releases continue the Committee would support the temporary cessation of operations until such time as the system was rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>As I keep saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, the onus is on the company to make sure that all the problems are rectified. The Committee report adds:</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these comments the Committee accepts the Supervising Scientist's assessment that there has been no discernible adverse impact on the environment from these occurrences. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that irrespective of whether there may or may not be any impact, the idea of the Magela Creek being used as a drain for this industry is just abhorrent. The question we must ask is this: Should a water system in a national park be used for the disposal of waste water from an industrial site?</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by quoting from the people who are most affected by any release of water into the Magela Creek system-the Aboriginal people of the area. The November 1986 edition of Land Rights News, which arrived on all our desks yesterday, ran an article from which I shall quote. The article refers to a meeting earlier this year at which the Ranger mine people talked about the problem of an excess of contaminated water. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ranger people told the landowners there was no problem with the water. The miners called a meeting with the Gagudju people and other groups associated with the Ranger mine. </PARA>
<PARA> Galarrwuy Yunupingu, the Northern Land Council Chairman, said: Toby Gangale and other Gagudju people were meeting with Ranger mine people and others from the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The discussion was about the level of contamination of water from retention pond number two. </PARA>
<PARA> The officials were saying that the water was fit for people to drink. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the water in question was in beakers being passed around the room. </PARA>
<PARA> Toby raised the beaker to his lips. He was immediately told not to drink the water by the officials watching him with alarm. </PARA>
<PARA> You can understand how Toby and other land owners out there in Kakadu are worried about this water problem . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that no one can actually be sure on at exactly what level can water be regarded as contaminated . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It's alright to declare that water is safe now. </PARA>
<PARA>What if it is discovered later that it was not safe? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> That's not good news for those people who do eat bush tucker, let alone for the general Magela environment anyhow. </PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of those people who would be most affected, I must say that I sincerely hope that the recommendations of our Committee report hold good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As 1986 draws to a close, and as the Parliament prepares to conclude its deliberations for the year, I take this opportunity to review for the House the efforts made by the Government and the Australian community to advance the objectives of the International Year of Peace. It has been a year in which the Australian community has given vigorous and articulate expression to its desire to help build a more peaceful world. At the same time, 1986 has been a year in which Australians have been given greater grounds for hope than for many years that the threat of nuclear war will be significantly diminished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>East-West Relations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with our national contribution to the IYP, let me say something about the international background to Australia's efforts. In a speech at the University of New England in September, I said that historic opportunities existed for the restoration of stability and realistic understanding between the super-powers. There was the prospect of less suspicion and tension than had been the case for a decade. Subsequently, the renewed intensity of negotiations on nuclear and space arms found dramatic expression at the meeting in Reykjavik between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. Naturally, there was disappointment in Australia and around the world at the failure in Reykjavik to reach final agreement on the truly breathtaking set of proposals which was discussed there. We should recognise, however, that during 1986 a fundamental transformation has occurred in the nature of the super-power dialogue on security issues. The United States and the Soviet Union have begun to cut through to the very essence of the profound differences that separate them in these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> Significant in this regard was the successful outcome in Stockholm at the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. This, the first East-West accord in security matters in seven years, indicated a new determination to restore momentum to the process of arms control and disarmament after years of stalemate. Significantly, the Stockholm agreement also saw the acceptance for the first time by the Soviet Union and its allies of a system of mandatory on-site inspections to verify compliance with the information exchange provisions. Greater openness in such matters is essential if real progress is to be made in disarmament and arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> The road ahead will not be easy. But I have no doubt that we are on the right road and I believe there are grounds to be optimistic that the super-powers are determined to stay on it. Australia has received regular and detailed briefings from the United States on progress in these matters and the Government has taken full advantage of numerous opportunities to inject our views at the highest levels on both sides on how progress might be further achieved. We will continue to urge progress with all the force we have. As I have frequently said, I do not exaggerate Australia's role and influence in these matters. But it is our firm conviction that we have the right and responsibility to be heard on issues of peace, arms control and disarmament. And we have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding our differences with the United States on some issues of principle such as the strategic defence initiative, the very healthy state of our relationship has enabled us to maintain a close and productive dialogue with Washington. And, while not seeking to ignore the gulf in strategic orientation and ideological perception which separates us from the Soviet Union, we have restored sensible contact with Moscow, without which any Australian arms control and disarmament policy would be meaningless. I have written on several occasions to President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev this year, making clear the importance that the Australian Government attaches to continued compliance with the SALT II Treaty. I conveyed our view that the Soviet Union has a case to answer on specific compliance issues, but that Australia was no less concerned at the United States announcement in May that future decisions on the structure of its strategic forces would no longer be bound by SALT II limitations. We will continue to make our voice heard. In a variety of other ways, the Government has been very active in the pursuit of peace and disarmament in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This year marks a historic moment for disarmament in the South Pacific. When the Senate passes the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill and related legislation currently before it, Australia will be in a position to ratify the Treaty of Rarotonga. Our ratification will be the eighth, and will bring the Treaty into force. Not only does the Treaty represent a major disarmament achievement, it also makes a positive contribution to regional security. The countries of the South Pacific Forum have built upon existing international treaties to make a new treaty that will help preserve the South Pacific as it is today-free from nuclear weapons stationed in the countries and territories of the region; free from nuclear waste dumping; and, with the tragic and we hope temporary, exception of French Polynesia, free from nuclear testing. All the countries of the region want to preserve these freedoms and that is the central purpose of the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the Government is very pleased that countries of the South Pacific, along with the United States and France, agreed in principle on 25 November to adopt the text of a Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region-the SPREP Convention. The Convention complements the Treaty of Rarotonga's prohibition on radioactive waste dumping at sea in the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. The Treaty does not seek to undermine the favourable security environment which the South Pacific enjoys. It does not in any way conflict with Australia's defence arrangements, notably ANZUS. On the contrary, the Treaty of Rarotonga seeks to build on the factors that have created and sustained the security of the region to help ensure that the South Pacific, unlike other parts of the world, does not in the future become a theatre for nuclear confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> The protocols to the Treaty adopted in final form by the South Pacific Forum in August this year will be open for signature on 1 December. These provide for the United States, the United Kingdom and France to apply provisions of the Treaty to their South Pacific Territories and for the nuclear weapon states-the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom, France and China-to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against parties to the Treaty or to conduct nuclear testing in the South Pacific. It is the Government's strong hope that all the eligible states, which have major responsibility for international peace and security, will adhere to the protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the Bill before the Senate goes further than clearing the way for the entry into force of the Treaty of Rarotonga, important though that is. For, in passing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Bill, Australia will become one of the first independent sovereign countries in the world to make a commitment by national legislation against the nuclear weapons option. The Bill commits this and future governments to prohibit the manufacture, acquisition and possession of nuclear explosive devices and the stationing and testing of such devices within Australia's territory. We take great pride in this stand. It is deeply regrettable that the Opposition in this House, and no doubt in the Senate, saw fit to oppose this historic declaration of principle.</PARA>
<PARA>Comprehensive Test Ban</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> During 1986, the Australian Government has continued to attach the highest priority in our multilateral disarmament diplomacy to the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban-CTB. Such a treaty would ban all kinds of nuclear tests in all environments by all countries for all time. It is a feasible and negotiable proposal whose implementation would be an important step towards preventing horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this month, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly voted on several resolutions dealing with nuclear testing. Two of these resolutions were sponsored by Australia and both received overwhelming support. The first was the Australia-New Zealand resolution on a comprehensive test ban which reaffirms the fundamental importance of such a treaty and sets out a program of action to achieve it. Five CTB resolutions were considered by the Committee this year. Australia's resolution, which has the best chances of contributing to a nuclear-free world, received 117 positive votes, the highest number of any of the five. The Australia-New Zealand resolution was co-sponsored by 26 countries, including Sweden, Canada and Japan. The United States and Britain, which had opposed our resolution in 1985, abstained this year. Only France voted against. This excellent result reflected the international community's acknowledgment of Australia's realistic approach and deep commitment to the early conclusion of a CTB treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Australian resolution considered this year calls on the nuclear testing states to make public each test and to provide certain data including the size of the test and the geology of the test site. This was a new initiative and the resolution received 107 positive votes. Only one country-France-opposed the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Chemical Weapons</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of chemical weapons has long been a high priority objective of the Australian Government's arms control and disarmament policies. We have made special efforts during 1986 to facilitate progress on effective international measures against such abhorrent weapons. Australia is at the forefront of international action to this end. The Australian Government is committed to the early conclusion of a comprehensive Chemical Weapons Convention which would ban the production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons and provide for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and their production facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been prominent at both the diplomatic and technical levels in the negotiations on chemical weapons at the Conference on Dis- armament. During 1986 Australia chaired one of the Conference's three working groups on chemical weapons which made considerable progress. We have also actively supported and participated in investigations by the United Nations Secretary-General into reports of the use of chemical weapons. We have instituted controls on the export of particular chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. In addition, Australia convened consultations during 1986 with 18 Western countries-known as the `Australia Group'-which have adopted similar controls with a view to co-ordinating such measures internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> These outstanding results in the cause of peace and disarmament were only made possible by the strong and sustained commitment of the Government to achieving real progress on arms control, a field in which little can be done without detailed expertise in the issues, international acceptance of the contribution we can make and the skills of sensitive diplomacy and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, from the moment it came to office, set about establishing for the first time in Australia's history, the necessary credentials for successful work in the field of disarmament. The highest credit for our success belongs to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, whose skill, initiative and energy have won him worldwide respect and regard. I should also acknowledge the efforts of our officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, and those of our Ambassador for Disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA>Ideals of the International Year of Peace</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> So far, I have talked about the international background to the International Year of Peace and the Government's own disarmament activities. In resolving to give its strong support to the United Nations' designation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace, the Government reaffirmed the high priority it has consistently placed on arms control and disarmament but, at the same time, agreed with the view of the United Nations that IYP activities should not be sponsored only at the level of national governments. Accordingly, the Government sought to encourage the wide range of individuals and community organisations in Australia who had set high value on the opportunities this year offered them to express their views and make their own contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The search for international peace habitually attracts close attention both from cynics and from utopians. Cynics say that military confrontation is inevitable and that no generation in history has been totally free from the threat of war. For their part, utopians are so eager for peace that they trust the panaceas of unilateral disarmament and isolationism, ignoring the unfortunate history of such policies. The view of this Government, however, is that to work for real peace is neither to ignore reality nor to neglect security. </PARA>
<PARA> During the IYP, I have witnessed again and again the yearning for peace among people in Australia, especially our young people. I have heard their conviction that there are better alternatives to the threats under which we live and that there are better uses for human and material resources than the accumulation of weapons. We believe that the IYP has provided a timely opportunity for people throughout the world to find ways of achieving progress towards the peace we all seek. </PARA>
<PARA>IYP Program</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The planning of the IYP program fell within the portfolio of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, and, again, he deserves full credit for his determination that the noble idea behind the IYP was fully and appropriately celebrated in Australia. To assist him in planning and implementing the program the Minister for Foreign Affairs appointed Mrs Stella Cornelius, the prominent community activist, as IYP Director. He also established IYP committees both at the national level and in each of the States and Territories with members drawn from a broad range of community organisations. I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to Mrs Cornelius's tireless and dedicated work for the objectives of the IYP and to the members of the various committees who gave so freely of their time and energy to make the program a success. I should also like to acknowledge the generous support given to the IYP by State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government approved a budget of $3.15m for the International Year of Peace program in Australia. These funds were divided on a roughly equal basis between three main components of the program: Information and advertising; a series of government projects; and, in recognition of the vital role of the community, $1,050,000 to support non-government projects. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Madam Speaker, and all honourable members, will have heard and seen the International Year of Peace advertisements on radio and television. Those advertisements were designed to relate to peace in all its meanings, and to counter despair and apathy with the message that, while peace is not easy to achieve, it is not impossible and every attempt at progress is a `Step in the Right Direction'. The media campaign was complemented by the production and wide distribution of 20,000 peace kits containing detailed information on Australia's role and achievements in disarmament and arms control and suggestions as to ways in which local communities might participate in the program. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to encourage better public understanding of the complexities of international arms control, the Government sponsored a number of projects, which included a series of public arms control and disarmament seminars in State capital cities and an international symposium on seismic verification, a vital technical precondition for a possible comprehensive test ban treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government International Year of Peace program was officially launched by the `Overture of Peace', a concert by over 2,000 New South Wales school students which was televised nationally in February. As an optimistic, joyful celebration of peace, it was a fitting beginning to the year. That event also symbolised the strong connection the Government saw between the International Year of Peace and the immediately preceding International Year of Youth. The enthusiasm and commitment of our young people for the goal of peace obvious at that occasion asserted itself again at His Holiness the Pope's peace rally in Sydney on Tuesday night. </PARA>
<PARA> Just over a month ago I presented Australian Peace Awards to Australians who had made outstanding contributions to peace in many areas of activity. In establishing these awards during the IYP, the Government sought to give fitting recognition to both the quality and diversity of community achievements in work for a peaceful future. These same elements were also reflected to an overwhelming degree in the non-government IYP projects organised and carried out by individuals and community organisations in every part of the country. Many of these received financial support from the Federal Government. I am also aware of many more community projects which have been mounted quite independently of any government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-government projects for the IYP have involved the churches, peace groups, academics, the Aboriginal community, artists, teachers, school students, welfare organisations, ethnic groups, women's organisations, the Returned Services League, service clubs, trade unions and many others. The projects have included conferences and seminars, theatrical performances and concerts, publications, videos, educational and research programs. They have taken place in every part of Australia, from the largest cities to the smallest rural towns. So impressive was this response to the IYP that the UN Secretary-General sent a personal message commending Australian community groups for their enthusiasm and commitment. Three UN secretariat officials who visited Australia to familiarise themselves with our IYP program were particularly impressed with its unique combination of government and non-government activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from this great community response that the IYP has been an outstanding success in Australia. Not only have Australians become more aware of why they should care about international events around them but also they have demonstrated their strong concern to leave the world at peace for the benefit of future generations. What has been achieved this year is a firmer basis for continuing work for peace in the future both by the Government and by the Australian community as a whole. The heightened awareness of the issue and sense of responsibility for a world of peace which the IYP has generated will not end on 31 December 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address some concluding words to young Australians who, more than any of us, have made their concerns about peace felt this year and whose responsibility it will be in the future to shoulder the burden of securing peace. I have already mentioned that I spoke earlier this year to an audience at the University of New England in Armidale. Let me conclude now as I concluded then:</PARA>
<PARA> Do not succumb to the paralysis of despair. It would be a tragedy if our young people, in particular, were to be so weighted down at the remote prospect of nuclear war as not to care adequately about their own self-development or to contribute to our society in a positive and energetic way. </PARA>
<PARA> Seek to decode the often confusing language of arms control, its acronyms and its technical jargon. Do not allow the so-called experts to monopolise the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Inform yourselves fully about the difficult international issues involved. Effective arms control will only come about through incremental, careful and patiently negotiated steps. Do not become overwhelmed by pessimism at the sometimes glacial speed of progress in disarmament negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, do not fail to let the political leadership of this country, and of the international community, know of your desire for tangible progress towards a saner, safer world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes this statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I am also very pleased to say, on behalf of the Opposition, that the goals and objectives set out in the statement are ones with which the Opposition can fully identify. The goal and objective of having bipartisan support in the Australian community for international efforts to secure a lasting peace is something that ought to command the attention and the energy of members on both sides of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join the Prime Minister in addressing a few remarks to the young people in our community and recognise, as he endeavoured to do, the genuine passion, to the point of understandable obsession, on the part of many of our young people to maintain a secure and lasting peace. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia recognise the profound yearning and desire of young Australians for peace. We associate ourselves with it, and we will identify ourselves with bona fide attempts to marshal the concern of young Australians for the cause of peace around the world. In doing that, we identify ourselves with a realistic approach to the cause of peace. We counsel against belief in simplistic slogans. We counsel against the unnecessary use of fear. We counsel against any kind of misplaced faith in the doctrine of unilateral disarmament. We remind the young, as we are all reminded by history, that the path of unilateralism invites only a false peace and a peace ultimately of totalitarianism. The history of the twentieth century is strewn with lessons to those who seek refuge in acts of unilateral disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a welcome opportunity for this Parliament to say something about the issue of peace and about the International Year of Peace. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, as to the goals and the objectives of what the Prime Minister said, he can rest assured that there is a bipartisan spirit in this Parliament on the issue of peace. The matters on which my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties and I depart from the Government and from the Prime Minister are not matters that surround our bona fides on the peace issue; they do not in any way diminish our desire to have an effective peace around the world but, rather, they represent a judgment on our part that in some areas the Government has mistakenly identified itself with false paths to peace and has mistakenly seen refuge in arrangements, treaties and objectives that, rather than securing a more peaceful future, may make our future less secure and therefore less peaceful. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal with three issues in that context. I deal, first of all, with the nuclear free zone in the South Pacific. We do not believe that the treaty giving effect to that is all that it has been painted to be by the Prime Minister. We do not believe that that arrangement has made that part of the world a more peaceful or more secure one. We believe the Government has an overoptimistic view of the benefits of the South Pacific nuclear free zone. We should remind ourselves that nuclear free zones do not protect us from the effects of nuclear war. That zone does not enhance security in that region. The zone does have the capacity to erode the potential and the capacity of the United States of America to match the growing Soviet presence in that part of the world. The treaty does dilute the responsibility on Australia to help maintain in that area an integrated resistance to the expansion of Soviet power. It implicitly denies the likelihood of a deteriorating international and regional environment. Given the circumstances that have unfolded in that region, we regard that as an overly optimistic approach. It restricts our ability to respond to what might be a radically altered strategic environment. We share the Government's continued opposition to the dumping of nuclear waste in the South Pacific and we strongly identify with the Government's opposition to nuclear testing in the region. The House will be aware that that was a policy zealously pursued by the Fraser Government during the seven years it was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area where we depart from the Government is, of course, on the question of the Reagan Administration's strategic defence initiative. The Prime Minister, during his speech, made an impassioned plea for an alternative to the present balance of terror around the world-a balance of terror which, incidentally, has kept the world from nuclear destruction over the last 40 years but, nonetheless, is the cause of the continued concern and sense of foreboding and insecurity on the part of so many of the young in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members on this side of the House see in the strategic defence initiative a highly moral purpose, as indeed the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden), who was praised only a few moments ago by the Prime Minister, once saw in it a highly moral purpose. As the Foreign Minister pointed out in 1985, it has the highly moral purpose of holding out the hope of a non-nuclear alternative to the existing balance of terror. I find it passing understanding that a government and a group of people, who I accept are bona fide committed to the cause of peace and genuinely want to find an alternative to the existing balance of terror, could adopt an attitude of opposition to the strategic defence initiative that is more belligerent, more hostile and more uncompromising than that of just about any other Western nation, particularly against the background of the Foreign Minister having once said that the Reagan Administration's proposal had a highly moral purpose. I think it has the highly moral purpose of providing a non-nuclear alternative to the existing balance of terror. Therefore, in this International Year of Peace, in identifying fully, as we do, with the goals that have been outlined by the Prime Minister, I just have to express on behalf of the Opposition our astonishment that the Government should so vigorously dissociate itself from an initiative which offers the only possible hope at present of providing a realistic alternative to the balance of terror. That is a fact. It passes comprehension that the Government should have a different point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in that context, deliberately and without any equivocation, that in my view, the great thing that emerged from the Reykjavik summit between President Reagan and Secretary-General Gorbachev is to be found in two areas. Firstly, it demonstrated what progress can be made on a basis of trust and good will between two super-powers. Even more importantly, as far as the defence and the security of the Western world are concerned, the utter determination of President Reagan not to bargain and trade away his strategic defence initiative is something that all of us in the West should applaud. He deserves the support and the applause of the Western world for having emerged from that summit with that attitude intact. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area that I wish to comment on relates to the importance of the contribution we make to the Western alliance. Barring the achievement of an effective, verifiable agreement on nuclear disarmament, which must be the continuing goal of people of good will around the world, we need to maintain an effective Western alliance. Although the Government constantly repeats its commitment to the ANZUS Treaty and although the stance taken by the Government in relation to the New Zealand Government's behaviour concerning the ANZUS Treaty has the broad support of the Opposition, on this occasion it has to be said that the Government is taking an increasingly minimalist approach to our alliance with the United States of America. We have to remind ourselves of what the Government did about the MX missile. We have to remind ourselves of its hostile attitude towards the strategic defence initiative. We have to remind ourselves, as the Prime Minister did in his speech today, that, as far as disarmament is concerned, this Government takes an attitude of moral equivalence towards the United States and the Soviet Union. I want to say on behalf of the Opposition that we do not take an attitude of moral equivalence as far as those two countries are concerned and we will never take an attitude of moral equivalence to the United States and the Soviet Union. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable member what I mean by that. The prime culprit for the level of international tension and aggressive action in the world today is still the Soviet Union. That is what I mean by that statement. How can the Prime Minister of this country wash his hands, Pontius Pilate-like, of any attempt to make a moral judgment about the conduct of the United States and the Soviet Union when four million Afghan refugees are in Pakistan, when hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops are in Afghanistan, and when we know of the aggressive conduct of the Soviet Union in relation to Afghanistan and the Soviet build-up in the South Pacific? How can the Prime Minister come into this House and deliver a serious speech on the cause of peace and pass absolutely no judgment at all on that? How can he behave as though the Australian Labor Party believes that, when it is all boiled down, the United States and the Soviet Union are equally to blame for peace being at threat and equally to blame for the level of international tension? That is an attitude that will never be embraced by the Liberal or National parties and it will never be embraced by the overwhelming majority of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say something about the domestic activities associated with the International Year of Peace. The Prime Minister waxed very lyrical about all the things the Government has done. The largest expenditure under the International Year of Peace appears to have gone to the Government's favourite advertising agency. Some of these odd-ball grants that have been identified by the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee are prime examples of the view that the International Year of Peace has something to do with what I would call the cue card approach that the Prime Minister is increasingly taking to Australian politics. If he has a problem area one of his minders puts up a cue card which states: `Talk about peace. Talk about the environment. Talk about the young. Talk about families'. And so it goes on. When we go through some of these grants we find, for example, that Senator Vallentine got $1,500 for a conference called `Just Defence', which reviewed Australia's defence needs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues will be saying something about the Liberal Party. The Foreign Minister interjects about the Liberal Party. When the Government had that opening conference, that spectacular gala occasion at the beginning of the year-it involved all the school children; it was meant to strike a bipartisan note; it was advertised and sponsored by the New South Wales Department of Education-why did it not invite representatives of the Opposition along? If the Foreign Minister is going to hold up himself and the Prime Minister as having taken a bipartisan approach to the International Year of Peace, he had better look at the correspondence that was exchanged between himself and me on that issue. That was nothing more than a blatant attempt to use the natural affection of Australians towards schoolchildren to promote the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The International Year of Peace has been littered with grants to all sorts of strange organisations, all of which have a particular view about the peace debate, a view that is not shared by the mainstream of the Australian community; and many of those examples have been demonstrated and brought out by my colleagues on the Waste Watch Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying again that there is bipartisan support for the goals and objectives set out in the Prime Minister's speech. We on this side of the House yield to nobody in our concern and our desire to match the aspirations, particularly of the young, for a more peaceful and a more secure world. We recognise the ever-present danger of nuclear war. We recognise, as all honourable members do, the horrendous consequences of that. We therefore share the Government's goals. We disagree with some of the Government's methods. We do not place benign, naive faith in nuclear free zones. We remember the lessons of history about flirting with unilateralism. We do not adopt an attitude of moral equivalence towards the United States and the Soviet Union. We believe that all Australians should remain profoundly in the debt of the United States for the moral and other leadership it has given to the Western world over the last 40 years. We on this side of the House will never be silent in the face of a Prime Minister who can talk for 20 minutes about the cause of peace and offer not one word of criticism of the imperialist expansion and anti-peace conduct of the Soviet Union since the end of the Second World War. It is only through recognising those realities that the true and lasting peace that all of us share as an objective can truly be maintained. </PARA>

General Gration's recommendation was based on a review by the Army of its training area requirements. This review has concluded that training priorities have changed since the Cobar proposal was first initiated. A recent review of Australia's defence capabilities by Paul Dibb has resulted in an emphasis on training in northern Australia, particularly on training for low level contingencies. That reduces, therefore, the Army's emphasis on mechanised training particularly at brigade level. Consideration is now being given in the short term to the relocation of the Second Cavalry Regiment from Sydney to northern Australia, in Darwin, and relocating a brigade from Sydney to northern Australia in the medium term. These considerations have obviously reduced the potential training value of the proposed Cobar manoeuvre area, and I have directed Army to examine the requirement for training areas in northern Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the honourable member for Perth, who of course is a very distinguished Australian sportsman, has asked this question because, as he says, this week we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. I suppose in some way the 1956 Olympic Games were an apotheosis for Australia; they were the first instance of Australia being recognised not just as an international power but as an international power in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some ways the 1956 Games led to the golden era of Australian sport, the 1950s and 1960s, when Australia certainly overwhelmed the world in a whole variety of sports. I suppose it is fair to say that in the intervening period Australia's performance has slipped, not so much because of a lack of talent in Australia but just because of a lack in some ways of government support for the great sporting talent we have always had, in contrast with the enormous support given by other countries to their elite athletes. Fortunately, and to the great credit of a former member from the opposite side who did know something about sport, the Hon. Bob Ellicott-who, by the way, was last night honoured with life membership of the Institute of Sport-the Institute of Sport was formed. I can tell the House that we are now on the verge of another golden era in Australian sport.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me just refer to performances in the last 12 months. The Australian hockey team, basically composed of scholarship holders at the Institute of Sport and of course including the honourable member for Perth, has won the world championship. The honourable member for Perth, the veteran of the team, was named the man of the series and obviously is the most distinguished hockey player in the world. It is significant that the AIS junior boys under-16 tennis team won the world championship in the last fortnight. So, Australia is well on the way back in tennis. Our women's water polo team in the last 12 months has won the world championship. The men's junior squash team from the Australian Institute of Sport has won the junior world championship. One of our female athletes in the squash unit has won the world individual women's championship. Our netball team from the Institute of Sport is the world champion team. In a whole variety of sports, we are once again exhibiting superiority on every international scene.</PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, I guess it is fair to say that this Government, with its continued interest in sport, has managed to raise our international status and standing in sport to the extent that now Australians, emulating the performances of their elites, are now participating in sport in great numbers, which is the sort of thing that this Government has set out to do. On top of that, I think it should be noted that the Institute of Sport has a sports medicine and science group, the Sports Science and Medicine Centre, which is recognised as the best in the world. So, in answer to this question, Australia is once again on the threshold of greatness in world sport, simply because this Government, following the very tentative lead of one member of the previous Government, Mr Ellicott, has built the Institute of Sport into the best such institute in the world. I think this demonstrates very markedly how silly the Leader of the Opposition is if he continues with the line of the New Right that sport is something in which governments should not be involved. There is no support for him in the sporting organisations around Australia. In fact, he is a laughing stock.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As Chairman of the Prices Task Force, he is now in the process of extending what has been a remarkably successful concept in his own electorate to dozens of localities all over Australia. By identifying the dearest and the cheapest supermarkets, these local price watch committees will be able to help the shoppers' dollar go further. There is no doubt, from the experience already obtained in the honourable member's own electorate, that this process will also promote greater competition amongst retailers. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations welcomed the Task Force in its October edition of the magazine Consumer Views, and we are very pleased to see that. Very significantly, against the scepticism and empty guffaws from honourable members opposite, I suggest that it is a matter of interest that the Australian Pensioners Association yesterday congratulated the Government for setting up the Prices Task Force. The Australian Pensioners Association will recommend to all its affiliated organisations throughout Australia that they give members of the Task Force full co-operation and involve themselves in its work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, the only criticism which seems to have come from any part of this country against the imaginative concept and initiative of the honourable member who has asked this question is, of course, from the one predictable quarter; and that is from the Leader of the Opposition, who described the price watch committees as `window dressing' that `will achieve zilch'. Once again the Leader of the Opposition has exhibited his cynicism and his lack of commitment to keeping prices down. He supports a total wages freeze for about 18 months on the one hand, and then says to the people of Australia, with whom he is supposed to be concerned: `while I hold your wages down absolutely for 18 months, I will abandon the Prices Surveillance Authority and I will pour scorn and contempt on any attempt by the Government to involve the community in helping to keep prices down'. This is the man who is supposed to have some concern for the families of this country. I say publicly on behalf of the Government and, I believe, the people of this country that we thank the consumer organisations and the pensioner organisations for their sense of realism, their sense of commitment and their preparedness to be involved with this Government in doing what we can to ensure that price rises in this country are kept to an absolute minimum.</PARA>

They tell me that in New York when he turned up for the General Assembly, usually for a month's stint, he would arrive with a $50 note and a pair of socks, and change neither. I understand that he was displaying a literary flair when he referred to the cucumber sandwiches. He is no doubt an aficionado of Oscar Wilde and The Importance of Being Earnest, and no one is less earnest in this House than he is in his capacity as shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs.

It is known by the initials AI, although that has a different significance for members of the National Party. Computers right up to the powerful fourth generation computers rely essentially on linear processing-that is, in the same way that pocket calculators work. Essentially they are very fast number crunchers and data sorters, but essentially dumb machines which lack the capacity to do the things that are very easy for us, like handling natural language, recognising patterns, or identifying faces on a photograph or reading maps.</PARA></TALK.START>

The nations which develop these machines first will have access to an enormous-almost an incalculable-market. We are already using AI in Australia in medical diagnostics. The Garvan Institute of Medical Research at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney has devised one of only four medical expert systems in regular use world wide. This expert system gathers the pathology results of endocrinology tests and makes a diagnosis on the basis of programmed knowledge of thyroid problems.

My Department has just published a handbook of research and researchers in artificial intelligence in Australia which I commend to honourable members. Unless we give a high priority to this vital area-I do not just mean government but the private sector as well-we will miss out very seriously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question should properly be addressed to the Commissioner of Taxation. I remind the House that the Commissioner has, on a couple of occasions, extended the time for the convenience of taxpayers, particularly for taxpayers who he believes may have difficulty in ascertaining what their returns should be. The clear point is that taxpayers are aware that their returns must be filed by 28 November and I am sure that most will do so. To the extent that that is not done because this is a new tax, I certainly believe that there will be some leniency on the part of the Commissioner in the way in which the new tax is administered. The Australian Taxation Office, in the administration of what is a very large area affecting more than six million people, quite sensibly operates with a certain amount of sense and aplomb. I have no doubt that this will be the case particularly for the fringe benefits tax, as it was with the withholding tax a couple of years earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> After extensive studies of the environmental and social implications of development of the site and consultations with both the State and local government, and with the co-operation of the Minister for Defence, I am pleased to say that this week we have been able to authorise the sale of the site on the open market, subject to a number of conditions. These conditions are: First, that the purchaser undertake the sale of 10 per cent of the residential lots to the Victorian Ministry of Housing at cost price; secondly, that the purchaser undertake to preserve, for open space and for recreation and conservation purposes, those areas recommended by the October 1986 report of the Williamstown Rifle Range Working Group; and thirdly, that the purchaser maintain the existing small tenancies held by fishing clubs on the coastal section of the property.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to place this land on the open market will open up beaches on the western side of Melbourne for the first time. By opening up this area not only is this Government making sure that the western part of Melbourne becomes a gentler place for people to live but also, through the work done by the honourable member for Maribyrnong to encourage beautifying the Maribyrnong River and Kororoit Creek, it is ensuring that the whole area will be greatly enhanced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now we press the hollow laughter button. In other words, the hollow laughter means that the Opposition accepts the contrary. They believe that the non-lodgment of a form on time would call into question the honesty, integrity and bona fides of any Australian who did this. Those opposite know that that is an absurdity. They do not believe it. I make the point that this Government has set the highest standards for its Ministers in both their ministerial and personal behaviour. In that regard it stands in stark contrast to the scandal ridden nature of the Government which preceded us and which slid out of office in March 1983 in its scandal ridden state. It is a measure of the personal quality of the Treasurer that he admitted this in the House last night and expressed regret at the oversight in his personal affairs. He has done that. When he raised this matter with me on Tuesday of this week he again expressed that regret and indicated that he would rectify the situation immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At no point has the Treasurer indicated other than that this was a mistake and one which he regrets. There is all the difference in the world between a Minister, in this case the Treasurer, making a mistake of this kind, readily admitting it and immediately rectifying it and some suggestion that a question of propriety is involved. By any standard or criterion one would wish to apply to this matter there is no question of ministerial propriety involved. There is no question of a pecuniary or any other gain involved. The Treasurer will be subject to the same penalties for this oversight as is any other taxpayer. It is in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation as to what is done. The Treasurer will not be treated by the Australian Taxation Office any differently should there be a decision that a penalty should be applied. There has been no attempt to withhold information or to dodge the matter. There is no standard upon which a question can be raised of propriety or misbehaviour by the Treasurer. On those standards he has my full confidence.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House censures the Prime Minister for his failure to maintain proper standards of conduct and responsibility within his Government and calls on the Prime Minister to apply the same standards of tax compliance against his Treasurer as he expects of all other taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion of censure, which is the most serious form of parliamentary attack that can be made on a government, I commence my remarks to the House by saying that if there were any doubt in anybody's mind that this motion of censure was necessary it was totally removed when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in that extraordinary answer that he gave a few moments ago said that a failure to lodge an income tax return was of no particular consequence and it was not a matter of serious significance. If ever there was an invitation from the highest political authority in this country to think that disrespect and contempt for the Australian taxation system is now the order of the day under the Hawke Government it came out of the mouth of the Prime Minister. It came out of the mouth of a man who, in company with his Treasurer (Mr Keating), has strutted this country. He has heaped abuse on any man or woman who has dared to criticise his so-called taxation reforms. He and the Treasurer have elevated to a veritable art form the art of smearing, slandering and traducing the reputation, normally under parliamentary privilege, of any citizen who presumes to disagree with them on tax or any other issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion above everything else is about the standards of the Government. This motion is about the ministerial standards required by the Prime Minister of the Ministers in his Government. This motion is also about the deplorable and reprehensible double standards of the Treasurer, because if ever a man in public office has earned himself the reputation of having double standards it is the Treasurer. He thinks that he can run the Australian Taxation Office the way he runs the right wing of the New South Wales Australian Labor Party-anything goes as long as you have the numbers. A lot of people in this country and in electorates represented by the Labor Party are fast running out of tolerance with the man who has earned himself the title of the most arrogant Treasurer, the most arrogant Minister, that this country has ever seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are ladies and gentlemen in this House but the Prime Minister is not one of them. The fundamental fact about this whole issue is the supreme arrogance of a man who has sworn to administer the taxation laws of this country but who regards it as so unimportant to comply with those very laws that for 15 long months he failed to lodge a taxation return. Then he had the unbelievable gall to come into this Parliament, as he did last night-and the Prime Minister has the unbelievable gall to support him-and say: `Oh, I am very sorry, it was an oversight'. He is asking the Australian public to accept that he had an oversight that lasted for 15 months. For 15 months he kept having an oversight about the failure to lodge his return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the present Treasurer of this country believes that he is above the ordinary laws of this country. That is why we say he ought to be sacked. The Prime Minister ought to dismiss him because he regards himself as being above the ordinary laws of this country. I can say to him, and I can say it on behalf of people all around the country, whether they vote Labor or Liberal-honourable members should have heard the talk-back radio programs of Sydney, Melbourne and all around the country this morning-that there is absolute fury that the highest taxing, most abusive, most arrogant, most self-righteous Treasurer that this country has ever seen should have the unbelievable contempt for the people who elected him to imagine that he could thumb his nose at the very standards he has rammed down the throats of the Australian community. That is the crime in political terms of this man, this man who has moralised and sermonised and hectored his way around the Australian community over the last 3 1/2 years, the man who has never shrunk from using parliamentary privilege to destroy the reputations of Australian citizens, the man who has elevated abuse, in slandering, to an art form. That is the political crime of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The political crime of the Prime Minister-he is the man who is ultimately accountable for the actions of his Government, the man who sets the standards, or fails to set the standards, for his Government-is that he has observed the worst standards of ministerial propriety of any Prime Minister this country has seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and the Treasurer had happened under Menzies or Fraser they would have all been sacked. In respect of Labor Prime Ministers, if it had happened under Chifley or Whitlam they also would have been sacked. Apparently under this Prime Minister it is the old adage: `Anything goes as long as you think you have the hide to bluff your way through it'. I have news for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: The Australian community will not tolerate double standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one great strand that runs through the Australian character, and that is a sense of equality and of egalitarianism. We have been preached and moralised to by the Prime Minister about fairness in the taxation system. We have all been lectured and we have all been exhorted to make the Australian taxation system fairer. I ask you, Madam Speaker: What is fair about a taxation system that requires of ordinary people that they lodge their taxation returns by 31 August 1985 but allows the Treasurer to go 10 months without getting a final notice and without getting a summons? All he gets after 10 months is a cosy call from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, and after 15 months he gets a cosy call from the Commissioner of Taxation. Why did he get it from the Commissioner of Taxation? He got it because the dogs were barking around this building that it was all about to come out. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we invited to believe that quite coincidentally at the beginning of this week the Commissioner of Taxation rang up and said: `Paul, it is Trevor here. You had better get that return in. It really has been overdue a bit too long and you can't really ask us to cop that any longer. You know you are occasionally like everybody else'. What is the Treasurer's miserable defence? He said: `I was too busy to put it in'. I say to the Treasurer that there are thousands of small businessmen around Australia at present who are too busy to fill in the Treasurer's lousy fringe benefits tax forms. If over the next few months there is massive non-compliance-and it is not something I encourage-the person who will be blamed for it will not be Bob Ansett but Paul Keating. If ever a person has failed that fundamental test that was put by the Special Minister of State, who said `Nothing is more important than the way in which these people who are called Ministers behave themselves and set an example to other people in Australia', it is this man. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this man-a man who has sworn to administer the taxation laws of Australia and to administer fairness and justice in those laws, who has ranted and raved at all of us about fairness and justice-done to the spirit of voluntary compliance with the taxation laws of this country? We all know that a tax system cannot be run with any hope of achieving integrity unless there is a spirit of voluntary compliance. All tax administrators know that if we rely totally and exclusively on intimidation and penalties we can never have enough bureaucrats to make that work. We need respect, and we need voluntary compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, in this Parliament, that respect and that voluntary compliance have been dealt a body blow by the Prime Minister because he got up at Question Time and gave a pathetic excuse, an excuse that will be thrown back at him every day on the campaign trail between now and the next election when he raises the issue of tax avoidance. I am more than ever delighted that the Prime Minister wants to campaign for the next election on the issue of taxation. I could not be more delighted because I will remind him on every day of that campaign trail that on 28 November he announced to the Australian people that it was no longer a matter of great significance if people failed to lodge their taxation returns. So pathetic, so bumbling was his defence of the Treasurer that he made that quite extraordinary statement. By that statement he has demonstrated a contempt for the observance of the laws of this country that he, above everybody else, is sworn to uphold. That is why I say to the House that the standards of ministerial propriety under this Government are deplorable and pathetically low. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard as I talked earlier an interjection from the Special Minister of State. We all know where he stands on questions of ministerial propriety. We are very high minded when in opposition but when we get into government we can not only mess up Customs declarations but also run off at the mouth and endanger national security in a car park after we have had a long lunch. So the Special Minister of State is no authority on ministerial behaviour. Despite the finding of a royal commission, despite the clearest possible finding of Mr Justice Hope that the Special Minister of State behaved in a way that endangered national security, the Prime Minister turned his back on his responsibilities and said to the rest of Australia: `I don't care what my Ministers do. I'm not going to impose any kind of discipline'. All I can say is that previous Labor Prime Ministers from Curtin to Whitlam would have been absolutely ashamed of his failure to impose decent standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The last 24 hours have been quite extraordinary. We are invited by the Prime Minister to believe that we know all about this because of this spontaneous honesty of the Treasurer. The Prime Minister said that the Treasurer said to him in a quite straightforward manner: `Look, I haven't filed my return, but I'm going to put it in tomorrow'. The Prime Minister said: `Good'. Is it good that he is finally going to file it, or is it good that he had not filed it over the last 15 months? I ask the Prime Minister and the House, as the Australian people will ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: If the Treasurer was so spontaneously honest, so straightforward, so frank and so candid, why did he not tell the Prime Minister a month ago that he had not filed his tax return? Why did he not tell him two months ago? Why did he not tell him six months ago? Why did he not tell him 12 months ago? The reality is that, if the dogs had not started to bark around this building, that 1985 tax return would still be outstanding in 12 months. For the Treasurer or the Prime Minister to try to pretend to anybody that this is an act of spontaneous confession, being good for the soul, on the part of the Treasurer is to insult the intelligence and the common sense of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> This failure by the Treasurer, this offence under the Income Tax Assessment Act, this contempt for the administration of the laws that he is sworn to administer, this monumental double standard, this thumbing of the nose at the high standards that a Minister in his position ought to establish is not, of course, the first disgrace of the Treasurer. It is not the first time he has exhibited monumental double standards. Remember the infamous travel allowance? One of the explanations why the Treasurer did not get the final notice may be that it was posted to his principal place of residence in Sydney. Maybe that is why he did not get the final notice. Well, Paul, why don't you go up there and clear the letter-box? You might find the final notice, and you might find a bluey from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation there as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague the honourable member for Forde (Dr Watson) reminded the House, 3,800 people failed to lodge their tax returns for 1985-86. I can assure the Treasurer and the Parliament that any of those 3,800 people who got a final notice or a summons or have been harassed or enjoined by the Australian Taxation Office to file their returns will be hammering on his door and the doors of his colleagues demanding to know why he has had special treatment. They will be knocking loudest on the doors of all his mates who are sitting in those marginal seats. His mate Punch in Barton will have quite a number banging on his door in Hurstville. He will want to know why the darling of the New South Wales Right, the man who is supposed to be the great saviour of the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales, has not only exhibited such monumental political double standards but also displayed such monumental arrogance. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought the Labor Party was born and dedicated to serve the aspirations of average Australians. I thought it was interested in fairness. I thought it had contempt for people who abused the privilege of office. I cannot think of something which is more characteristic of somebody who is abusing the privilege of office than somebody who thinks that he can get away with not filing a tax return for 15 months. I go back to that, Madam Speaker. It was not just a momentary oversight. If he had been a couple of days late in 1985, he could explain that as an oversight. For 15 months he was in such a state of arrogance and indifference to the idea that the ordinary laws of this country could apply to him that he really did not think it was important enough for him to file his return. </PARA>
<PARA> What that arrogance has done to his capacity to administer his job and what that arrogance has done to his credibility in the eyes of the Australian community is absolutely monumental. He has no hope ever again of persuading the ordinary taxpayer of this country that he is running a fair system. Every time he gets up in this Parliament and every time he stands on a platform around Australia and says that he has brought decency back into the taxation system, people will remember this. Every time he talks about a rort and every time he talks about the ramping of the system, they will remember the great Keating double standard. They will remember `one law for the rest of you mugs out there and another law for me'. That is the measure. In good old New South Wales right wing Labor tradition he will say: `We have the numbers. We have the white cars', complete with New South Wales number plates and tinted glass in his case. I reckon he ought to get a double thickness of that tinted glass after this because he will be so much more unpopular as a consequence of this.</PARA>
<PARA> The real tragedy is the damage that has been done to the respect that ordinary Australians have for the taxation laws of this country. That damage has been done by the Treasurer's arrogance, double standard and insensitive capacity to smear and hurl innuendo at the reputations of decent, honest Australians. Above everything else, the man who today has even king hit the Treasurer in arrogance and double standards is the Prime Minister because out of his arrogant mouth came those words that will haunt him from now until the election-the greatest invitation to a burgeoning of the cash economy that has ever been uttered in Australia-that failure to file an income tax return is not an act of great significance. That is what he said. That is what the Prime Minister said. On behalf of the outraged taxpayers of Australia, we say that the Treasurer ought to go and that the Prime Minister ought to have the guts to sack him and to impose some decent standards on the Australian Ministry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has just made a speech, the quality of which may be tested by the fact that he began with and ended with a blatant and deliberate misrepresentation of what I said. In regard to the action of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), I said it was a fault; I said it was not one of immense consequence. Those were my words. Because the Leader of the Opposition knows that that was a correct statement, he could not found his motion of censure on the words which I used. At the outset, the quality and the sincerity of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition are to be judged by the fact that he deliberately chose not to base his motion on the words that I used because he knows that if he had attempted to do so on those words he would have been laughed out of court. He will be, at any rate, but he will be judged by the fact that he sought to censure the Prime Minister of this country and deliberately based his motion on words other than the words that I used. He is out of court from the beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He is out of court, secondly, on the fact that his motion is scarred and characterised by the most blatant hypocrisy because, in the course of his pathetic speech, he referred to the fact that he would compare the standards of propriety of this Government with those of its predecessors. In the course of doing that, he had the temerity to refer to the findings of a royal commission during the office of this Government. All right, Madam Speaker, if he is to introduce the question of comparative standards of propriety, let us remind ourselves at the outset of what happened under the Fraser Government. The language of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry in relation to the standards of behaviour of a Minister of that Government was such that it was commonly acknowledged around this country that any Prime Minister in those circumstances would have had no alternative, if he were to follow the standards of normal propriety of behaviour, but to dismiss that Minister immediately. Such was the strength of the language of the royal commissioner appointed by the Fraser Government into the behaviour of the Minister concerned. But no, those opposite ignored, repudiated, the language, the findings, the decisions, the observations, of the royal commissioner. Worse than that, not only were they content with ignoring that language but they attempted virtually to bring into question the integrity of the royal commissioner himself. This Leader of the Opposition brings his baseless motion, his dishonest motion. It is dishonest in the sense, let me say, that he based it on language that I did not use. If one is going to attempt to censure the Prime Minister one should at least have the honesty to use the language that the Prime Minister used. </PARA>
<PARA> The weakness of the case of the Leader of the Opposition is that he recognised that he could not base it on the language I used and so quite deliberately put other words into my mouth. We do not need any other basis on which to test the integrity, character and quality of the attack launched by the Leader of the Opposition. If he ever reaches a point where he can honestly state what is said and what is done, there is just the beginning of a chance that those in this place and outside this place might begin to listen to what he has to say. It should come as no surprise, as indeed it does not, that he has no capacity to put the case based on an honest premise. This so-called man of principle, having been drubbed by the Australian electorate for the abandonment of any pretence of principle and having now been politically paralysed for months by his lack of leadership over any serious issue facing this country, has learned nothing from that process. He stood on his so-called principles and he lost. He played politics and he lost. Now he seeks to play the man, and he will lose again. </PARA>
<PARA> This is simply a motion born of fear. It has no other string, no other source. It is a motion born of fear. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he simply cannot match the Treasurer in this place. He has not got the guts, the courage, the wit or the wisdom to attempt to match the Treasurer on a matter of substance. As I say that of the Leader of the Opposition, what about the person who sits in the chair opposite now and who is going to second the motion? Have we ever seen such a pathetic performer, one so incapable of beginning to match the Treasurer in debate on matters of substance? They cannot do it, so in this position of abject incompetence and total fear they attempt to play the man. They will lose again. As I said, both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer simply are afraid to take on this outstanding Treasurer on matters properly within his portfolio; they never take him on. What is a characteristic of this place as far as the Treasurer is concerned? It is the consistent and continual lack of courage on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer ever to begin to take him on because they know that, in terms of command of his portfolio and in terms of his competence, they get smashed into oblivion on the occasions when they have remotely begun to try to take him on. We have reached the stage in fact where, because of their fear of the man, they have lost the stomach for the fight on matters of policy and substance. </PARA>
<PARA> They not only lack that courage, but also hide their policies. They will not bring them out; they are afraid to bring them into the sun. It is on that basis, a basis which is a factual exposition of what has been happening in this place, that they now seek to attack the man. It is a measure of their desperation and it is a measure of the personal quality of the Leader of the Opposition. It is the final straw that these men of straw seek to clutch at. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the straw. The Treasurer has failed to lodge his tax return by the due date. That is a fact. As I have said, and I repeat, I will use the language again that I used in answer to a question, not the language that the Leader of the Opposition quite improperly and deliberately attributed to me. What I said was a factual statement of the position, that is, that for an ordinary pay as you earn taxpayer this would not be a matter of immense consequence. I will repeat that statement not only in this place but also outside. If the Leader of the Opposition says that he will use this on the campaign trail, there are two things wrong with that: Firstly, he will not be the Leader of the Opposition on the campaign trail so he will not have the opportunity of using it. I say that simply because I believe that that is what the Opposition will do, but as I believe it I will each day and night pray that I am wrong because I hope that he is still there leading those opposite. It happens to be the case that the people of Australia on whose behalf he purports to come into this place and speak have expressed their judgment about him and are continuing to show, like at least half the people behind him, that they do not trust him, that they reckon he is a sham and that they reckon he is a fraud. Look at the polls. He is assuming proportions such as those of the previous member for Bruce. He is a joke out in the electorate and because he is a joke he comes in here trying to play the man. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I said before: The fact is that the Treasurer failed to lodge his return. That is a fault which he has honestly, openly and without qualification conceded. That is beyond dispute. I repeat: The fact that he failed to lodge the return is not of itself a matter of immense consequence. It would be if indeed he was trying to advantage himself, but the fact is that the fault has been one which has cost him money. The situation, as I understand it and as the Treasurer understands it, is that he will be entitled to a refund, so it cannot be said that the fault, of which he is certainly guilty, of not lodging his return is one that has been engaged in either deliberately or by oversight to financially advantage himself. To the extent that it is a fault-and it is-the financial sufferer will be the Treasurer himself. But if we listened to this Leader of the Opposition, would we have believed that? No, because at the very beginning he attempted to equate the action of the Treasurer with those activities in this community which I and the Treasurer have previously condemned and which we will go on condemning, that is, the activities of avoidance and evasion which added up to billions of dollars and which cost the ordinary decent people of this country, for whom he hypocritically claims to speak now-these ordinary decent people who the Leader of the Opposition said are going to be knocking on the doors in Bankstown and in the electorate of Barton. These are the ordinary people that the Leader of the Opposition robbed-that is what happened-because he allowed the tax avoiders, the tax evaders, to get away with billions of dollars. Because he allowed the privileged few to get away with billions of dollars, it is these people in the electorate of Barton, the ordinary people of Australia, who have suffered, not because of any oversight but because deliberately, as their own royal commissioner said, those opposite allowed the tax avoidance and evasion industry to become the fastest growing industry in this country. It is a measure of the hypocrisy, the indecency, of the Leader of the Opposition that he would seek to equate that behaviour, which did indeed rob and hurt the people of this country, with the fault of the Treasurer in not lodging his return. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that he can sell that pup to the Australian electorate, it is yet another indication of his intelligence and the insult he gives to the intelligence of the Australian electorate. The electorate will not buy that attempt to equate that behaviour which he condoned with the oversight, the fault, of the Treasurer in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question, therefore, of ministerial propriety. There is no question of financial gain. The Treasurer is indeed the financial loser as a result of his own fault in this case. That of itself, I suggest, dismisses immediately any proposition that there is impropriety on his part. There is not. The Leader of the Opposition demands the resignation of the Treasurer of this country. The Leader of the Opposition is the one who ought to be thinking about the security of his office and his position because it is well known that half his own members are just waiting for the moment to throw him out of his office. I believe that will happen. It will happen because those behind him share the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the electorate. It is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the electorate that he is a man of no principle, no substance; a man completely of expediency. It is that expediency, that lack of principle, out of which is born this pathetic motion which I and the Government reject with contempt. </PARA>

<PARA> Whenever he has the alternative of the high road of principle or the low road of expediency, like an unerring missile he always chooses that low road of expediency. </PARA>
<PARA>These words were used by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the steps of Parliament House this morning about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and this afternoon he said that the Leader of the Opposition could not match the record of the Treasurer, Mr Keating. We are proud that the Leader of the Opposition does not match the record of the Treasurer. We are proud that the Leader of the Opposition is able to fill in a travel allowance claim successfully and properly, and we are proud that for five years he was Treasurer of this country and did not fail to put in a tax return. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which this Government responds to responsible criticism is to heap abuse on those criticising. The Prime Minister used exactly the same tactic this afternoon that he and the Treasurer have used in every debate and every Question Time in this House. The words `miserable, pathetic Opposition' have been used now for 3 1/2 years, and the Government has hoped for a very long period that those words would continue to be repeated by the ladies and gentlemen of the media. For a time they were, but it is no longer possible to come into this House merely to heap abuse. It is no longer possible for the Prime Minister to come into this House and say against all the evidence, that the Opposition does not take the great economic issues to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hansard record proves that when the Prime Minister says the Opposition is not taking the Government on in economic matters, he is-I cannot use a certain word-committing an untruth. He is telling the people of Australia something which is untrue according to the Hansard record. Every debate is there. Every major issue on economic matters has been taken up by this Opposition with the Prime Minister and with the Treasurer. One of the reasons why the Treasurer is in real trouble with the Australian electorate is that he has treated all those serious debates with arrogance and contempt. This Treasurer would not even provide briefings from the Australian Taxation Office to the Opposition until we raised this matter in the Parliament. He has treated us and the Australian people with arrogance and contempt and he treats his own people with such arrogance and contempt that there are no more than six government members in the House to support him. The Government had difficulty in getting people in to listen to the Prime Minister. It was sending out special warnings and ringing people in their offices. They had to be brought into the chamber to support the empty speech of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition had five years of the heavy responsibility of the office of Treasurer and he conducted himself with dignity, with propriety and with effectiveness. Despite all the nonsense and all the rubbish that those opposite talk about tax evasion and rorting and so on, the present Leader of the Opposition did more to stop the schemes, stop the tax nonsense, than any other Treasurer in Australia's history. That is the fact of the matter, and it is on the record and it is in the books. It does not matter what the Government says day after day to the contrary, the record is there; it cannot be denied. </PARA>
<PARA> The heart of this matter is what happens to a Treasurer versus what happens to an ordinary citizen. I asked my colleagues this morning what happens to ordinary citizens who do not lodge their tax returns. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) brought to my attention the case of a constituent of his who had the following experience: The constituent on 21 April 1986 received a summons from the Australian Taxation Office for lodgment of his 1984-85 income tax return for which he had gained an extension until 28 February 1986. So he got an extension until 28 February 1986 for the same return-for last year-that the Treasurer did not put in. On 21 April he got a summons. No final notice was issued to his home address. The next day this constituent sent a copy of his return to the Taxation Office. </PARA>

Indeed the Tax Office did owe him money. The taxpayer was entitled to a refund from the Tax Office of $1,381.66.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seriously believe that they will get away, in Bankstown and Brunswick, with the rubbish they bring into this House, just let them go out there and repeat what the Prime Minister said in this House today. He claimed that we had misrepresented what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, failure to lodge a tax return for an ordinary PAYE taxpayer is a fault. But it is not one of immense consequence. Madam Speaker, it is a fault exhibited by a large number of Australians every year. Although it cannot be commended, nor can it be condoned, it is not Madam Speaker a question on which any one of us would bring into question the honesty, the integrity or the bona fides of any of our fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>There out the door, Madam Speaker, goes $8 billion in the cash economy. It makes a total nonsense of the statement made by the Treasurer when amending the Income Tax Assessment Act. On 11 September he made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is committed to stamping out tax evasion . . . Among the most common tax offences are failure to furnish information to the Tax Commissioner and failure to file a return. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been debating in this House for weeks the identity card, the police state that these people opposite are trying to bring in. We have had a report from the Standing Committee on Expenditure which says that the office that the Treasurer has been administering for 3 1/2 years is a shambles. He has made dozens and dozens of statements about the need for ordinary people to do the right thing. He has made these statements day after day. But today he gets blown out of the water by his own Prime Minister. Why did he get blown out of the water? It was because the Prime Minister does not have the guts to stand up for the principles of decency and ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has two faces. Both of them are red today. He is the high man of principle, who stands up on public occasions and preaches like a preacher. Then he comes into this House ranting and raving, speaking absolute rubbish and trying to put cases which are not sustained by the facts. The Prime Minister, at the national Tax Summit, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the problem of a huge revenue loss. </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about people who do not put in their tax returns. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Paper shows how, as a direct and almost inevitable result of the operation of the present system, tax avoidance is becoming endemic and threatens to become entrenched almost as part of a way of life for a significant part of our great nation. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the words of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> That is something even more serious than the loss of revenue involved, because it goes to a loss in our national character, a loss in the quality and standard of our national life. </PARA>
<PARA>If the quality and standard of our national life are held in the repository of the Treasurer opposite and the Prime Minister, they have gone for a burton. There is absolutely no way in which ordinary taxpayers and young people paying tax for the first time can have any sense of confidence in the words of the Prime Minister when they know that they have a Treasurer who not only has failed to put in two successive tax returns, but also cannot even put down the correct address of his principal place of residence on his travel allowance form. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Treasurer will object to my raising this matter again, but it really has to be raised again, because this new incident just brings up all those old questions. There was never a satisfactory explanation for the travel allowance question. The Government brazened it out. The Treasurer had a house in Sydney which was unoccupied and which could not be occupied because it was being renovated; he was living in Canberra with his family; he admitted it; everybody knew it. The rules say that one is able to claim travel allowance when one comes here to Canberra and leaves one's principal place of residence. One has to make a declaration to that effect. The Treasurer made a declaration to say that his principal place of residence was in Sydney when it was not, and he claimed in that one year $17,000 tax free for that particular allowance, and that was allowed by the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> This was never satisfactorily explained. We asked question after question. The Prime Minister came in here and said that black was white; the Treasurer came in and said that black was white. He brazened it out. The matter has not been satisfactorily answered, and our research evidence shows that most Australians really worried about that; most Australians lost confidence in the Treasurer after that. This matter shows us that people were right to lose confidence, because there is new evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that the winners in this whole matter are the vast body of taxpayers, because the Treasurer is owed money by the Tax Commissioner. Nobody else in Australia is entitled to say that he or she is owed money by the taxman or that he or she owes money to the taxman until the return has been put in and the assessment received. Nobody else is entitled to have this special licence, and in this particular case we must ask some questions. Taxpayers failing to lodge 1985 returns would have been issued final notices on or about 20 November 1985. Was the Treasurer issued with a final notice about 20 November 1985? Apparently not. Presumably failing taxpayers then receive further notices. Where was the further notice? Presumably, failing taxpayers then are prosecuted in the courts, like the constituent of the honourable member for Dawson. That is what happens to them, probably regardless of whether lodgment has taken place by then anyway, as in the case of the constituent of the honourable member for Dawson. Taxpayers lodging late in 1985 or paying late for 1985 receive final notices demanding 1986 lodgment by 31 October 1986. In other words, the Tax Office is very tough on those people who have a bad record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of the motion moved by the Opposition are about the responsibilities of the Prime Minister in this matter. The motion talks about the failure of the Prime Minister to maintain proper standards of conduct and responsibility within his Government. Well, the first and most obvious issue is that there is no question of ministerial responsibility at issue. The question here does not relate to any conduct of my ministerial responsibility. It is a private responsibility, and hence, because there is no ministerial responsibility, there can be no such responsibility on the Prime Minister-which honourable members opposite well understand. The issue here is a private responsibility which I have to the Commissioner of Taxation and it is not an issue of ministerial responsibility. Hence the Prime Minister's proper prerogative as the Prime Minister with the leadership of the Government and the concern about the ministerial proprieties of colleague Ministers is not at issue, because this is not a ministerial propriety issue. This does not go to the conduct of my ministerial responsibilities. It is about a private responsibility I have under the Income Tax Assessment Act, like every other taxpayer, to the Tax Commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This, of course, is the fatal flaw in the argument of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He referred to the man charged with the administering the tax Act. I am not the man charged with administering the tax Act; it is the Commissioner of Taxation. One would have thought that after five years as Treasurer he would have understood that basic point that the person administering the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as amended, is the Commissioner of Taxation by a statute of this Parliament. So that is where this motion fails. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just a piece of cheap politics which has been brought on to attempt to embarrass the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's responsibilities in this matter are abundantly clear, and even though it is a private responsibility of mine, I made it quite clear--</PARA>

But I make it quite clear that last night in the Parliament I told the House in unequivocal and unambiguous terms that I had not filed the returns for 1985 and 1986, and that I had filed the 1985 return earlier this week and would be filing the 1986 return. The moment it became an issue in the Parliament I raised it here in a quite unambiguous way. I said then, and I repeat, that I regret having not filed the return. There is no excuse for me. The return should have been filed. I do not walk away from that whatsoever. But the fact is that I did make a mistake but, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, my mistake did not cost half a million people their jobs. My mistake did not retard the economy for 20 years. My mistake did not induce a massive domestic recession, unlike his mistake which almost destroyed the fabric of the Australian economy.

I was asked in Question Time by the Opposition about the possibility of a civil offence under the Income Tax Assessment Act, but there has been no mention of the criminal offence of stealing letters in the mail, and no explanation by the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer of how they became the beneficiaries of this theft. They should state quite unequivocally where they got the copy of this letter, how they came by it, so that we can establish how this criminal offence against the Post and Telegraph Act took place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the Leader of the National Party that if that one point was out of order, most of the behaviour in the last five minutes on both sides of the House has also been outside the Standing Orders.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the last day of the session. This Government has done everything possible to produce a better tax system, a fairer tax system and a more decent tax system by the eradication of fringe benefits, of entertainment expenses and of capital gains. All have been opposed by the Opposition. The Australia Card has been opposed by the Opposition. The only thing the Opposition ever did as a government was to wipe out the criminal evasion schemes after five years of their flourishing. Even yesterday's report of the Commissioner of Taxation showed that $52m was lost in revenue under the schemes which operated throughout the Leader of the Opposition's period as Treasurer. Yet he is now trying to demean my work and the Government's work in making the tax system decent, all on the basis that I did not get a tax return in on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That will not deflect me from supporting a decent tax system, from making the tax system better, and from arguing to Australians that they are entitled to an honest tax system, that they are not entitled to be ripped off by the con merchants and the criminal evasion and avoidance schemes, fringe benefits, non-cash benefits, capital gains and the rest. The Leader of the Opposition stands here with no credibility on taxation. He should not think that whether I have furnished a return on time or not matters in this respect, because what matters is the principles of taxation law which the public well and truly understands. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are at the end of a long session, having seen Australia go through a trading crisis in April, emerging from one of the most difficult periods in economic history, yet the Opposition has not laid a glove on the Government once. The Government has knocked the Opposition off like blowflies over the course of the parliamentary year. Opposition members have been so easy to deflect. With all of those issues the Opposition has not made one solid point. The Government is now laying down a big Budget, putting the tax changes into effect and seeing the economy turn. Yet there was not one question from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday on the issue of the national accounts. The House rises today but now the Opposition thinks that it has found an issue-in the last hour of the last session for this year. We have been through a massive economic change and an economic crisis earlier in the year. Yet what are Opposition members on about? My tax return! Also we find that the person who is charging me has not put his own tax return in for 1986. That is where we stand. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had all those distortions about the travelling allowance. These miserable, deceitful distortions have been repeated day in and day out about my travelling allowance. Yet the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who sits beside the Leader of the Opposition on the front bench, draws the same allowance even though he lives in this city and has his children at school here. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has also done this and so has everyone else; yet we have had this unprincipled, indecent attack from the Leader of the Opposition on this matter because he has never been able to get on to the big issues-the economy, the Australia Card, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax or even putting through the Bills that tidy up the criminal evasion schemes. These Bills were defeated three times in the Senate in 1983 and 1984. There is $52m outstanding and the Commissioner of Taxation cannot collect it because he does not have the legislative power. Whom do we thank for that? The Leader of the Opposition! He has thrown all this personal abuse at me and it has gone on now for a couple of years. First of all I was supposed to be tied up with the Nugan Hand bank; then we had the breach of promise stuff from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey); then we had the VIP flights, then the travelling allowances and now my taxation return. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does the Leader of the Opposition stand on fiscal policy? Where does he stand on wages policy? If one asks anyone in Parliament where John Howard stands in Australian politics, nobody now knows the answer-not on fiscal policy, not on wages policy, not on taxation. We will hear all his policies two hours before the next election. That is how the Leader of the Opposition leads the Liberal Party of Australia. In the last few minutes of the last hour of the last day of the last year of economic turmoil he displays irrelevance. Let me conclude by saying that I regret having not filed my income tax return. My future tax returns will not be overdue. All taxpayers should file their returns on time and there can be no excuses-that must be said. But that does not cover the deceitful approach of the Opposition for standing against every decent piece of taxation law that this Government has tried to introduce and every decent piece of economic policy that it has pursued. No amount of personal attacks on me will ever confuse the Parliament about that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee relating to patents, innovation and competition in Australia, together with the Government's response to the report. This report was circulated in August 1984 and limited copies are available from the Bills and Papers Office. I seek leave to make a very brief statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has now concluded its consideration of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee's report reviewing the patent system entitled `Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia'. IPAC made 46 recommendations with a view to making the patent system work more favourably in the interests of Australia and Australians. It took a very long time because of the complexity of the interest groups to be consulted and accommodated. A major thrust of the report is to increase the usefulness of patents as a means of fostering innovation in Australia and, through the international patent system, of developing export markets. The two-tier requirement of novelty proposed for standard and petty patents is an example of a measure aimed particularly at meeting the needs of Australian industry of all sizes. The report also contains proposals for reducing any anti-competitive effects of patents and for improvements on a variety of administrative matters ranging from examination of patent applications to enforcing patents in the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the issue of the duration of patents, IPAC recommended that the present 16-year patent term be retained but that extensions of terms be abolished. The Government approves this proposal in principle. For pharmaceutical, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the effective patent life is eroded by regulatory delays in obtaining marketing approval. The industries concerned are seeking compensatory extension of the patent term. The Government will be considering this aspect further. Most of IPAC's recommendations are accepted wholly or with some qualification. A more detailed discussion appears in the Government's response to the report. I intend to introduce legislation, where necessary, to implement the response at the earliest opportunity. The emphasis in the report is on the possible; it is constructive rather than revolutionary. I believe that most users and practitioners of the patent system will welcome the changes proposed to be given effect, and that the community generally will benefit from them. I thank the Committee, particularly its Chairman, John Stonier, for the effort and vision which went into the preparation of the report. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned residents of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the humble petitioners have grave concern about recent changes in the Extradition (Foreign States) Act of 1966 which deny basic rights which have been a cornerstone of the English and Australian law for over seven hundred years. We are speaking of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the right of an individual to defend himself against his accusers. This concern has come to light during recent extradition proceedings against Messrs Hempel and Etheredge in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that because judicial protection of these basic rights has been excluded from the Act refugees, migrants, Australian overseas travellers, and visitors are at risk when they have been to (or come from) countries where the norms and practices of human rights and civil liberties are below traditionally accepted Australian standards.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned petitioners, therefore urge the Government to re-examine the Extradition (Foreign States) Act (as amended in 1985), and amend the current Act so that the rights of the accused are once again judicially protected in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we urge the Government to refrain from entering into any further extradition treaties or proceedings under the current Act until the process of re-examination and amendment of the Act has occurred.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. 2600. We your petitioners, humbly showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the wildlife species, in this case-the kangaroo, have a right to exist and flourish independently of human needs. For this reason alone we should not regard the kangaroo as a human resource nor contemplate commercial exploitation simply because more offspring are born each generation than can hope to survive.</PARA>
<PARA> Permissible cropping rates are unknown and the means of enforcing controls or protective legislation is completely ineffective and inadequate due to the widespread nature of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> All Australians have a responsibility to our already declining wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA> We your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban the exports of products made from kangaroos.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Take action to see that State Governments prohibit the commercial killing of kangaroos.</PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Staff Elected Director</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned who are staff of the ABC and the SBS respectfully showeth that: The proposed legislation to amalgamate the ABC and the SBS, together with certain existing provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (as amended), would have the effect of removing the present Staff Elected Director of the ABC from office before the end of his elected term, and of barring him from standing for re-election. This offends basic democratic principle.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: The Government will remedy this situation by either, continuing the current Staff Elected Director in office until the normal expiration of his term on 15 December 1987 or, making such amendments as are necessary to the Broadcasting and Television Legislation Amendment Act 1986, to enable the current Staff Elected Director to contest an early election after amalgamation, whilst preventing him from seeking a further term immediately following the one for which the early election is held.</PARA>

<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Western Australia call on the Commonwealth Government to reverse recent decisions which deny Secondary Allowances to Year 11 students under the age of 16 years and make such allowances directly payable to students on attaining the age of 16.</PARA>
<PARA> This request is made on the basis that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Education Benefits as part of income support benefits generally are a Commonwealth responsibility under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) It is the right of parents with children in Year 11 in Western Australia to receive the same benefits as parents with children at the equivalent stage of their education in other parts of Australia irrespective of their age.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) This decision by the Commonwealth Government will impact most unfairly on the capacity of low income families in Western Australia to keep their children at school in Years 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Direct payment of the allowance to 16 year olds will make it easier for young people to leave home and bring more pressure on State Authorities to find alternative accommodation for them at the community and taxpayers' expense.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation was passed by the House of Representatives in 1985. Several amendments were passed by the Senate. They were either moved or accepted by the Government in the Senate. Most of these are of a procedural or consequential nature, but there are some of substance. The first relates to the bringing of procedures under the Racial Discrimination Act into line with those of the Sex Discrimination Act so that a person who has been discriminated against on the basis of race can get a determination to that effect. At present, a person who has been discriminated against on the ground of his or her race or ethnic origin can only get a certificate which is not enforceable. This is an anomaly and the Government has moved to correct it. Another amendment relates to the legislation in respect of the Sex Discrimination Act. That Act included a provision that discrimination did not include a distinction which was based on the inherent requirements of a particular job or position. An amendment was moved which is sufficiently broad to meet the concerns of any religious, educational or charitable institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed Commission is a new structure. It will have as members a part time President, the Human Rights Commissioner, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the Racial Discrimination Commissioner. I think it meets the requirements of having in place some legislation that deals with our obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is significant that tomorrow is the international day for the recognition of human rights in the United Nations and it is appropriate, despite the many difficulties that have been experienced in getting legislation through the Senate, that we have an opportunity to accept the amendments now proposed. I urge honourable members to support them. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quality is here; the Minister is quite right. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has pointed out, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill was originally passed through this House in late 1985. One year later it is back here. At that time it was part of the Bill of Rights package. We opposed the entire package for the reasons which we stated here then and which we stated throughout the country. What happened? The Government withdrew the Bill of Rights legislation. Reasons were sought to be advanced as to why the Government withdrew the Bill of Rights legislation, but it withdrew it for one very simple reason: The Bill was unpopular, it was rejected throughout the Australian community and that rejection was made manifest everywhere. I went around this country addressing public meetings in all the States and the Northern Territory. The reaction against the erosion, as the public rightly saw it, of our rights and liberties under what was proposed was strong. For that reason and no other reason, the Government pulled back. It pulled back simply because it had an electoral liability. When this Government is faced with electoral liabilities, as it will be faced with one in the case of the identity card, its capacity for compromise and capitulation is truly remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original Human Rights Commission was established under the Fraser Government. That Government was wise enough to set up that Commission with a five-year sunset clause which by now would have just about come into effect. We will have a replacement commission. Let me make it quite plain that on this side of the chamber we entirely and consistently support the cause of human rights in this country, but we have a different view as to the way in which to go about things. I should have thought that this Government would have learnt that the establishment of a commission with wide-ranging powers to make value judgments as to what some of the very general statements of principle in the various international covenants mean is not something that suits this country and is not a way of going about things that reflects our values. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the House of one or two aspects of the way in which the existing Commission has worked. We can hope for no better from what will take over its work. In the first place, when it found that its activities were criticised by the then shadow Attorney-General what did it do? It excluded him from its premises. That illustrates a very peculiar approach to questions of human rights since one of the human rights that we are meant to uphold is that to criticise and to suffer criticism. Next, it was asked by this Government to do a number of reviews on legislation. It did a review, review No. 14 for the Attorney-General, of the Queensland electricity supply and related industrial laws. One of the changes made in Queensland was to the effect that, where a person is a member of a trade union, that person, under the change made to the laws of Queensland, could resign at any time at all rather than having to give notice. Most of us would think that was perfectly fine because we are dealing with voluntary associations and, if members of a voluntary association wish to quit such an association, they should be able to do so immediately. This is what was said by the Commission and it illustrates the ideological bias of the body and the great dangers of vesting these wide-ranging powers to make value judgments in a commission such as the one that was set up and such as the one that is to be set up. Referring to the Queensland law, report No. 14, at page 13, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It repeals the existing section 48 of the Principal Act and substitutes a new section 48 which allows for resignation from a union by a union member to be immediately effective on the member so notifying the union in writing. This provision overrides any union rule which provides to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA>What is wrong with that? The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission considers that such a provision could lead to an erosion of the financial position of unions, damage union solidarity and make unions less able to work for and protect the interests of workers generally. It is understood that most union rules provide a minimum period of notice of resignation partly to ensure the financial stability of the union-</PARA>
<PARA>and what has that to do with the rights of members, one might ask-</PARA>
<PARA>and partly to prevent members resigning in a huff over a particular decision made at a particular time by a union with which they may not for the moment agree. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Australians are too damned stupid to be able to make their own decisions as to whether they want to be in or out of a particular union run by a particular group. </PARA>
<PARA> One other reference to its work is a publication entitled Teaching for Human Rights which was put out under the banner of the Human Rights Commission. In regard to what it calls the `capitalist world'-and this publication was to go to schools-it states:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been mass assassination, too, by more covert and indirect means. The construction of a capitalist world economy, predicated upon dishonesty and greed, has slaughtered uncounted millions the world over through the exploitation and misdevelopment of global resources. The United States and other erstwhile free market democracies have much to answer in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>That kind of ideologically loaded teaching is not the kind of teaching we need in our schools. That kind of propaganda is not the kind of role that this Commission should have. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore oppose the legislation. In doing so, let me conclude by saying this: We in this country have nothing for which to apologise when it comes to the protection of human rights. Our record is not perfect, but it is one of the best records-and consistently one of the best records-in the world. That is how it will be so long as we have a democratic process in this country. But this kind of Commission will not add to our rights and is the wrong road to go down for the protection of the kind of rights that most people in this country believe in, and certainly that most members on both sides of the House believe in. </PARA>

The Commission, to that extent, has been carrying out worthwhile work. To some extent, some of the comments made by the honourable gentleman, I fully understand and appreciate, would cause concern.

<PARA> (c) may give directions relating to procedure that, in its opinion, will enable costs or delay to be reduced and will help to achieve a prompt hearing of the matters at issue between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> `(2) The member conducting, or presiding at, an inquiry shall determine any question relating to the admissibility of evidence and any other question of law or procedure.</PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments to the Cheques Bill 1985 will enable customers of non-bank financial institutions to issue a new instrument, to be called a payment order, which will be similar to a cheque except that it will be drawn on a customer's account with a non-bank; transfer liability on so-called agency cheques from non-banks to their customers and protect non-bank customers who use these agency cheques; extend the protection afforded banks collecting cheques to non-banks performing that function and impose a duty on non-banks to ensure prompt presentment of cheques lodged with them for collection on behalf of their customers; and clarify some provisions presently contained in the Cheques Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of the amendments will be to place non-banks and their customers, whether using agency cheques or payment orders, in a similar position to banks and their customers who use `ordinary' cheques. It is expected that the legislation will come into operation on 1 July next year. Amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Accounts Debits Tax Administration Act 1982 will be required to be in place by then to ensure that payment orders are treated in the same manner as cheques for taxation purposes. This legislation is expected to be introduced early next year. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

It has been suggested to me by some representatives of the banks that deferral of proclamation dates might be useful for the purpose of looking at any technical problems. I hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) will look at that matter so that, if there are technical problems, they can be sorted out as quickly as possible since this is not the sort of Bill over which one should engage in any kind of disputation as it is essentially non-controversial.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer, of course, to your election, Madam Speaker, to the Speakership of this House, which members on both sides of the House would agree was one of the more important events not only of this year but of the history of this House. We remember it now at the end of the year with a great deal of pride. I would like on behalf of the Government to thank all those who have served this House through what by any standard has been a long and arduous year. I wish them personally, and their families, a particularly happy and restful Christmas. I mention particularly in this regard the Whips and their staff-on our side, Joan McKain especially-and the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, John Engledow. I also wish a merry Christmas to and thank our friends who sit above us in the Press Gallery. I know there are not too many of them there now but I know that they are listening and dwelling on every word that I say. Once again during this year they have been prepared to suffer the hardships of Kakadu National Park, the non-members bar and even my bowling in order to keep the Australian public accurately informed of political events.

<PARA> That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 17 February 1987, unless otherwise called together by Madam Speaker or, in the event of Madam Speaker being unavailable, by the Chairman of Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>It is customary for the Leader of the House on the final day of the session to say to the seven or eight honourable members who are still here-and to send copies of the Hansard to those who are missing-how much we have enjoyed the year. I am sure that people who were listening to the broadcast of proceedings a little earlier in the day thought that we were enemies on opposite sides of the House, but as Billy McMahon once told Clyde Cameron: `You always hurt the ones you love'. We know that John Howard and others have a deep affection for those on this side of the House, and of course that affection is reciprocated. It is our intention and our wish that we should remain in our respective positions for some years to come. I also thank the Clerks for the work they have done and for the advice and guidance they have given through the year in order to facilitate the smooth running of the Parliament. If the Parliament does not run smoothly, Madam Speaker, it is not your fault or the fault of the Clerks; nor is it the fault of the Hansard people, who do an outstanding job. We should always place on record at this time of the year our appreciation of what they do. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said, it was an historic occasion when you, Madam Speaker, were elected to your position. One had only to look at your family, particularly your children, when they were assembled at the time you celebrated your election to see the pride they had watching you rise to the great position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other people to thank, including those who work for us in the dining rooms. We are not always the most generous of guests because we work extremely hard and we work very long hours, and we are not always in the good humour that I maintain. Some members can be objectionable and I would like to apologise for them. I just say to the people in the dining rooms how much we do appreciate how well they look after us. I thank all staff members including my own personal staff, particularly a person who has served as my principal secretary for the last couple of years, Dr John Loy, who will shortly return to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, where he came from. I cannot express enough my gratitude for the work he has done and the way in which he has been able to co-ordinate all the people who work in my office and who have been of great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I say a very sincere thank you to the right honourable member for New England and Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Sinclair) and the Whips. Obviously there must be discussion between us to see that the business goes through the House. I know that Ewen Cameron and the bushman's friend, Ben Humphreys, get on very well and make sure everything goes smoothly, as do the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Port Adelaide so that we are able to conduct the business we are called together for. While speaking of the Government Whip, I was invited to his daughter's wedding tomorrow and unfortunately I cannot be there; I have to go and speak for the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). But to Brenda and Aaron, the Parliament wishes you all the best. We hope that you have a nice life together and that you are able to come down here to see your famous father at work in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> To everybody else who perhaps we have not been able to mention individually, I say that we do appreciate the work they do for us. I do not believe the Australian public has a full appreciation of the hours that are put in by the parliamentarians in the national Parliament, the travelling that we do and the pressures that are placed upon us and our families. It is a great privilege to represent people in the Parliament but it does bring with it some burdens and great responsibilities. We are very tough on each other in the Australian political scene, and that sort of thing can make life difficult as well. On behalf of the Government, I do say to all those concerned with the Parliament: Thank you very much, we hope that you have a nice Christmas, that you keep watching the tax cuts when they come in next week and that you keep voting Labor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opening, I should say that the stamina of the Leader of the House (Mr Young) amazes me. I am told that he was in great form at about 8 o'clock this morning, having been in even better form a couple of hours earlier. On behalf of my colleagues in the National Party of Australia and others on this side of the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and I share in the general wishes of good will that have been extended by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the House. As the Leader of the House noted, perhaps many honourable members are more notable by their absence than there presence at this time. It has been, to say the least, an interesting session and I think your guidance over the affairs of this somewhat unruly chamber at times, Madam Speaker, and that of your Deputy and indeed all those responsible for our guidance, have been such that we appreciate your services and now wish you well during the well earned respite for which you are about to depart.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is little doubt that thanks should go to the Clerks, the Hansard writers, the people in the Parliamentary dining rooms, the people in the Joint House Department and, perhaps above all those whom I particularly wanted to mention, John May and his staff. This afternoon they have done a sterling job.

<PARA> Each of the three former speakers mentioned our staffs. Without doubt they are the core of everything that is done in this place and to them I would certainly also like to extend my thanks. Beyond that there are many of our families, both male and female, to whom we also owe a debt. Parliamentarians have an extraordinary life. It is not easy to be at home with them and do all those normal things that one might do. To hear that the Government Whip's daughter is to be married tomorrow illustrates one of the difficulties-how hard it is for us to spend time with them before those events. As all honourable members of this House would, I wish her and her future husband well. I think that we might also extend our thanks to our respective spouses for the jobs they have done and for our long-suffering families, many of whom I think suffer far more than we do for the occasions when we perhaps launch into each other on matters that they take very much to heart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government strongly supports the States' initiatives to transfer basic nurse education from hospitals to the advanced education sector and has offered financial assistance to the States to help achieve the transfer by 1994. Specifically, the Government announced in the recent Budget that it would provide $7.7 million in 1986-87 to the States and the Territories for this purpose. As part of the Commonwealth's commitment, eligibility for student allowances has been extended to students undertaking nursing courses in colleges of advanced education.</PARA>
<PARA> The transfer is either well underway or planned for commencement by 1988 in all States and Territories with the exception of Queensland. agreements formalising the transfer arrangements have already been signed with South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth expects that significant benefits will result from the transfer, including a more flexible nursing workforce, wider employment opportunities and enhanced status for nurses and increased education and vocation opportunities especially for women.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Queensland Government's refusal of the Commonwealth's offer to assist in the transfer is particularly disappointing given the response from other States and the Territories, and the rapid progress being made in implementation of the transfer. In 1986, the second year of the transfer program Commonwealth assistance is available in respect of up to 2700 basic nurse education places in colleges of advanced education.</PARA>

<PARA> In addition, 1300 places are available in colleges as part of a fully Commonwealth-funded pilot program in basic nurse education. These include 142 students enrolled in 1986 in the Queensland Institute of Technology's basic nurse education course. Details of funding in respect of these courses are not available as Commonwealth tertiary education grants are made available on the basis of a lump sum for each institution, with the allocation of grants for particular courses being a matter for the institutions themselves.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The advertisement in The Canberra Times gave incorrect information about the scope of responsibility and location for the 4 positions concerned. The positions are in fact located in the Nursing Homes and Services Branch of the ACT Health Authority's Community Health Services Division. The Branch, in addition to managing the Authority's nursing home program, is also responsible for the operations of the Community Nursing Service and for the professional nursing aspects of the Authority's Alcohol and Drug and Mental Health Services. The advertised positions control all administrative, education and research activities for the Branch.</PARA>
<PARA> The positions are temporary, but, unfortunately, the advertisements did not reflect this. They will be reviewed early in 1987 because the sale of Allambee Nursing Home and the outcome of the National Case on Nursing Structures will have a bearing on the need for permanent staffing and the category and classification of the positions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Additional expenditure on salaries is not involved. The positions have been filled on a temporary basis since March 1986 when the Community Health Services Division was established. The positions were advertised to regularise an existing situation.</PARA>

There are currently 5 VYP located in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> Under CTP, funds for new projects have generally been allocated on the basis of the distribution of population, and within that criterion, the suitability of projects.

<PARA> (1) Yes. On 22 October 1984 I referred the report to my colleagues, the then Ministers for Administrative Services, Industry and Commerce, Trade, Communications, Science and Technology, Finance and Defence Support with a request that it be given consideration in the development of policies within their portfolios. Since then considerable activity has taken place in the development of industry policy and account has been taken of the broad thrust of the recommendations, to the extent practicable, in relevant policy activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Of the fourteen recommendations in the report, eight have been implemented substantially, four remain under consideration pending the examination by the Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements (the Inglis Committee), and two have been rejected, viz Nos. 7 and 13.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In regard to Recommendation No. 7 payment by the Commonwealth is generally already consistent with accepted commercial practice with respect to business dealings with the public sector. The use of bank guarantees is covered in the Commonwealth Purchasing Manual and the standard conditions of tender and contract. Securities for advance or progress payments in the form of bank guarantees, letters of credit, or bonds are accepted by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>In regard to Recommendation No. 13, although the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services is required to collect statistics on Commonwealth purchasing, it has not attempted to maintain an information base on ownership of contractors because to do so would be adminstratively difficult, be expensive to maintain, and not be cost effective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Government purchasing of technology-intensive products is being examined by the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. The issues raised by the honourable member will no doubt be considered by the Committee and will be looked at by the Government when it receives the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A number of initiatives have greatly improved the financial environment for innovative and export-orientated high technology firms in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development expenditure. It has complemented this intitiative with the Grants for Industry Research and Development (GIRD) Scheme. These two measures help innovative companies to the end of the R&amp;D stage.</PARA>
<PARA> Several Government initiatives provide support beyond this stage. The Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) is now able to provide more finance for industry through an increase in its capital and gearing ratio. Its charter has been amended so as to give greater emphasis to the high technology areas of manufacturing industry. The Government's deregulation of the financial market has improved the range and quality of financial services offered to manufacturing industry and stimulated Australia's traditionally conservative financial sector into greater risk taking. The Management and Investment Companies (MIC) Program is designed to attract support for the start-up and early growth of Australian based enterprises which generally have the potential to grow rapidly into substantial businesses. Such companies would be export oriented and would use innovative technology. Under the program a 100% taxation deduction is available to investors in licensed MICs in the year of subscription. The MICs use investors' funds to invest in eligible enterprises as defined in the MIC Act and certified by the MIC Licensing Board.</PARA>
<PARA> Among non-Government initiatives in the financial sector has been the establishment on Australian Stock Exchanges of the Second Boards. The requirements for listing on Second Boards make it easier to raise capital for new ventures. The successful listing on the main boards of Australian Stock Exchanges of new high technology companies also indicate that there is considerable willingness to invest in high technology ventures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that at this point there is no need to consider further terms of assistance.</PARA>

<PARA> These instruments specifically prohibit the use of labour which is exacted from persons under threat of penalty and for which these persons have not voluntarily offered themselves.

<PARA> The introduction of a universal scheme which made receipt of unemployment benefits conditional upon performance of unpaid work may contravene one or more of these Instruments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Service types eligible for funding under the Home and Community Care (HACC) Program include:</PARA>

<PARA> (9) None of the $10 million available in 1984-85 was spent in that year. The States were reluctant to commit and spend these funds in the lead up to signing Agreements. Accordingly, the Agreements provided that the funds unspent in 1984-85 could be rolled-over into 1985-86. The earliest State signed an Agreement in September 1985 and the last State signed in April 1986, well into the 1985-86 financial year.</PARA>

<PARA> (14) (a) No. (b) Full expenditure was not achieved due to the time taken in submitting claims, short time frames between commitment dates and when expenditure had to be achieved, and the time taken to develop State/Territory plans for the expansion of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) Yes. Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) As the Agreement did not come into effect until 1985-86 the 11 service types shown in the Agreement and indicated in the Minister's Second Reading Speech did not apply until 1985-86. Question 13 provides the estimated split for 1985-86.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) No. No.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) No, because narrowly focussed sub program guidelines may hinder the development of integrated services providing one or more of the service types listed above.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The document `The Home and Community Care Program, Commonwealth priorities for service development' sets out a checklist for reviewing service. This requires joint development by the Commonwealth and States to provide more detailed guidance to service providers.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) Estimated expenditure for 1986-87 is $131.94. It is not possible at this stage to estimate expenditure by service types. The notional allocation of this between States is:</PARA>
<PARA>$m</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales ...</PARA>

<PARA>Victoria ...</PARA>

<PARA>Northern Territory ...</PARA>
<PARA>0.676</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory ...</PARA>
<PARA>1.156</PARA>
<PARA> This notional allocation is subject to change, depending on the actual expenditures of States. States have the capacity to roll-over into 1987-88 any unspent 2:1 new Commonwealth money and some States will avail themselves of this provision.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) I am not able to identify the source of the figure quoted in the member's question. However, the expenditure figure is estimated at $579m for the three financial years 1984-85, 1985-86, 1986-87.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) The HACC Agreement provides that the Commonwealth will increase its contribution to the Program in 1987-88 by up to 20 per cent over its expenditure in 1986-87 providing that the State/Territory agrees to increase its contribution by the same percentage. In future years the Commonwealth and States/Territories must increase their contributions to the Program by 20 per cent each year unless otherwise jointly agreed.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) There is substantial evidence of a significant deficit in community care services for aged and disabled people including:</PARA>
<PARA> studies conducted by the Australian National University and the Department of Social Security (in conjunction with the Australian Council of the Ageing) indicate that fewer than 8 per cent of aged people with a moderate or severe disability have access to a formal community care service;</PARA>
<PARA> over the next 20 years it is estimated that the 65 years old and over population will increase by 44 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> `In a Home or at Home: Accommodation and Home Care for the Aged' the report from the House of Representatives Committee on Expenditure 1982 and the more recent report of the Nursing Homes and Hostels Review highlight the historical imbalance of funding for residential care against support for the aged and disabled to live with dignity in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the annual 20 per cent increase in funds available for the HACC program must provide for cost increases in existing services as well as expansion in service provision. Realgrowth will therefore be somewhat less than 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) It is intended that the Program, based as it will be on needs assessment, will go some considerable way in enabling many people in its target group to avoid premature or unnecessary admission to long term institutional care at less cost to the larger community and with greater quality of life gains to the individual.</PARA>
<PARA> (24) A national information collection system is expected to be operational by late 1987.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Yes. On 3 July 1986 an anti-tank mine exploded under a civilian passenger vehicle carrying 33 people 60 kilometres from the town of San Jose de Bocay in the northern province of Jinotega. 32 People, including 12 children, were killed. Sandinista authorities claimed that the mine had been planted by the Contras and that similar mines had been used in other parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I am not aware of the incident being reported by the Australian media.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) There have been numerous incidents over the past three years in which the Contras have been accused of killing or injuring civilians, including:</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 May 1986, on the same road where the above incident occurred, an anti-tank mine killed nine health workers, including a Spanish paramedic, Ambrosio Mogarron.</PARA>
<PARA> One woman was killed and seven other passengers wounded when Contras machine-gunned the ferry ``Rio Escondido'' on its route between Rama and Bluefields on 3 July 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> On 11 May 1986, Contras entered a house in the village of La Santos in the province of Chontales and shot and killed a woman and her 10 year old son and wounded three other children.</PARA>
<PARA> On 16 February 1986 five civilians (four women and a Swiss man) were killed when Contras attacked the vehicle in which they were travelling near Somotillo in northern Nicaragua. Thirteen other civilians were wounded.</PARA>
<PARA> On 28 July 1986, three European technicians and two Nicaraguans were killed when their vehicle was machine-gunned by Contras near Zompopera.</PARA>
<PARA> Twenty four civilians were killed when Contras ambushed a truck carrying coffee workers in northern Nueva Segovia province on 5 December 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I am not aware of the details of Australian media coverage of these incidents.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) In a public statement on 2 July 1986 I said that the vote in the United States House of Representatives on 25 June to approve US$100 million in aid to the Nicaraguan Contras would do nothing to promote a peaceful settlement of Central America's problems and would escalate tensions in the region. I also said that the aid was not likely to encourage the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua to improve political freedoms, or to negotiate with the Contras.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The United States withdrawal from the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ is a matter of regret to the Australian Government. As the principle judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ is of central importance to the international regime of law and justice, playing a role not only as an arbiter of disputes between states but also as a body widely recognised as competent to clarify and develop the principles of international law. Unfortunately, fewer than one third of the nations in the world have accepted the Court's compulsory jurisdiction (for example, neither the Soviet Union nor any of its Eastern Bloc allies have done so). The Australian Government will continue to encourage acceptance by all countries of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court as a demonstration of commitment to the rule of law and an expression of confidence in the Court itself.</PARA>
<PARA> As the United States had undertaken to give six months' notice of its withdrawal, it was still subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ in the case brought against it by Nicaragua. While the United States may not agree with the approach taken by the Court in that case, the Court's decision cannot be regarded as capricious or as divorced from established international law. It is fundamental to the rule of law in the international community that the ICJ should be respected and that parties to a case should abide by their obligation to comply with the decision of the Court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The primary role of Airworthiness Surveyors in the Department of Aviation is to monitor the aviation industry, to ensure compliance with the safety requirements specified in Air Navigation Regulations and Air Navigation Orders, as they relate to the airworthiness of civil aircraft. There are no private individuals in the aviation industry who perform a comparable regulatory function. There are, however, Engineering Consultants in the industry who are authorised by my Department to approve such servicing functions as the design of modifications and repairs to aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> A circular letter was despatched by the Victoria/Tasmania Region of my Department on 8 September 1986 to some 150 organisations within those States, advising that due to a number of sudden resignations by Airworthiness Surveyors, delays could be expected in the processing of work, pending recruitment of suitable replacements. This letter also advised that incoming work would be processed in accordance with a priority rating, based on its relevance to the continuing safety of aircraft operations. The opportunity was also taken to remind these organisations of the existence of Engineering Consultants who are available to perform work of a non-regulatory nature.</PARA>

Some of these numbers would relate to beneficiaries appearing on benefit more than once during the year. While it is not possible to measure precisely the extent of the duplication, the proportion of unemployment bene- ficiaries current at a given time during 1985-86 who had multiple benefit episodes (unemployment, sickness or special) during the preceding 12 months was about 24 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commission has since 1980 taken to Court three cases involving misrepresentation of the place of origin. The Commission was successful in each of the prosecutions before the Court.</PARA>
<PARA> Details of the cases are-</PARA>
<PARA> on 24 October 1984 Gary Lai Pty Ltd was fined $5000 for having supplied bed linen manufactured in Hong Kong which had been repackaged and labelled `Skilfully made in Australia' (Barton v Gary Lai Pty Ltd (1984) ATPR 40-495);</PARA>
<PARA> on 19 February 1985 Croner Trading Pty Ltd was fined $31,500 for removing `Made in Korea' tags from toy koalas and kangaroos and attaching swing tags which included the statement `Proudly made in Australia' (Barton v  Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1985) ATPR 40-525); and</PARA>
<PARA> on 19 June 1986 Wes Lofts (Australia) Pty Ltd was fined $6000 for having falsely represented that rolls of masking tape which had been cut to size in Australia, rewound on retail-sized spools and repacked were `Made in Australia'; the tape had in fact been imported in large rolls from the United States (Korczynski v Wes Lofts (Aust) Pty Ltd (1986) ATPR 40-643).</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has also sought and obtained undertakings from other firms not to label or advertise goods in a way likely to mislead consumers as to the place of origin of their products. Thus:</PARA>
<PARA> shoes labelled `Made in Australia' but only made up here by gluing together imported soles and uppers were relabelled as `imported components assembled in Australia';</PARA>
<PARA> the packaging of cosmetic accessories made in Asian countries and sold under the brand name, `Esprit de France' was marked to indicate the true country of origin; and</PARA>
<PARA> the manufacturer of a toy labelled `Proudly Australian Made' agreed to make it known that the main component of the toy was imported.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Apart from the direct enforcement activity noted above, the Commission has also been active promoting compliance by other means. In conjunction with the launch of the `Buy Australia' campaign, the Commission issued a leaflet in September 1986 entitled `The Trade Practices Act and labelling the origin of goods'. This leaflet contains information to assist businesses to meet the requirements of the Act when labelling their goods with their place of origin and to avoid potential labelling problems. The Commission was also involved in the formulation of criteria for the use of `Australian Made' logo, to ensure that its use complies with the policy of the Act. The Government is confident that the Commission will continue to secure compliance with the Act. For these reasons the Government has not thought it necessary to request the Commission to undertake more detailed investigations.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The information required to produce an estimate of the additional payments made by consumers for domestically produced and imported goods during 1986-87 as a result of barrier assistance will not be available until some time after the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> At present, 1982-83 is the most recent year for which the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) has published estimates of these additional consumer payments. However, the IAC will shortly be publishing estimates of assistance to manufacturing (including the additional consumer payments) for 1983-84 and 1984-85. Due to the increased level of local production in recent years and the effects of inflation, estimates of additional consumer payments in 1983-84 and 1984-85 are expected to exceed those published for earlier years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The present drafting style adopted in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia is criticised in that paper.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Lawyers, members of the business community and the Attorney-General for Victoria have criticised Commonwealth drafting on the grounds that the style is unnecessarily complex. So far as I am aware, the other State Attorneys-General have not criticised Commonwealth drafting.</PARA>
<PARA> If legislation is drafted in a style that is unnecessarily convoluted, repetitious and cumbersome, it imposes unnecessary costs on the business community and is difficult for Members of the Parliament to understand. However, much legislation is necessarily complex. An Act cannot be less complex than the policy it gives effect to, because it must state, as precisely as possible, the intention of the Parliament. The Supreme Court of Victoria recently considered an Act drafted in the style approved by the Attorney-General for Victoria. The Court criticised the drafting of the Act, on the grounds that precision had been sacrificed in the interests of simplicity. The Court said that, if legislation does not make Parliament's intention clear, much time is taken up in the courts, costs and delays are increased and injustice may follow (R v O'Connor, October 1986, not yet reported).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Attorney-General for Victoria has stated that the VLRC intends to attach a plain English version of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act to its final report. I have seen preliminary drafts of two sections. Although shorter and simpler than the Commonwealth equivalents, the drafts were legally defective in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am satisfied that Commonwealth drafting style is of a high standard. However, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel recognises that there is room for improvement. The Office has recently started its own program of simplifying its style. Some practices adopted by the Commonwealth in the past have resulted in unduly complex language. The Office has been reviewing these practices, and in December 1986 it will begin a series of measures to simplify its style. The proposed style will not be a radical change. It will be a leaner, clearer version of the existing Commonwealth style.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr Scholes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Annual Report of the Department of Territories does not make the first and second claims above. It does make the third claim, but not incorrectly. Specifically:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Report does not state that there were financial guarantees in the legislation to establish the proposed ACT Council.</PARA>
<PARA> The reference in the Report, under the heading ``Financial Arrangements'' on page 29, is that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The legislation provided for financial arrangements to ensure the new Administration's fiscal control over the considerable range of responsibilities to be transferred. The Commonwealth also undertook to enter into detailed negotiations on financial matters with the incoming body and provided specific financial guarantees, to ensure the smooth and orderly transfer of responsibility.'' (emphasis added).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Report records at page 28 that the ACT Council Bill 1986 was introduced into the Senate on 16 April 1986 (Senate Hansard of 16 April 1986, pages 1736-1739). Amendments were tabled by the Government in the House of Representatives on 3 June 1986 and were incorporated in the Senate Hansard on the same date.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report does not state that the Bill was rejected in the Senate. In three places (the Secretary's letter of transmittal and pages 28 and 29) it states that the Bill ``had not passed the Senate''. That is still the fact.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Report states at page 29 that the electoral system proposed by the Government, that is a mixed electoral system with ten members elected from single member electorates and nine members elected from the ACT at large, is ``similar to that successfully operating in West Germany''.</PARA>
<PARA> At both Federal and State (Lander) levels in the Federal Republic of Germany, there are mixed electoral systems, in which some representatives are elected directly and some by proportional representation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1986 (Hansard, page 3195), the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) asked the Prime Minister a question, without notice, concerning imports of frozen concentrated orange juice from Brazil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further to the Prime Minister's answer, the following additional information is provided:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does recognise that the Australian citrus industry is experiencing considerable problems because of the impact on local processing fruit prices of low priced imports of frozen concentrated orange juice from Brazil. The industry itself recognises that it must re-orient its activities more towards producing for the fresh market it it is to be put into a stronger economic position.</PARA>
<PARA> Some relief for the industry should be provided as a result of the preliminary finding by the Australian Customs Service that dumping of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice has been occurring and has caused material injury to the Australian industry. The Australian Customs Service has recently released details concerning the minimum free on board export price level at which it considers imports will not cause injury to the local orange growing industry. The minimum price determined is $A1,640 per metric tonne of concentrate, unpacked at the port of shipment.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the provisional anti-dumping measures is not meaningless. It has raised the price of imported orange juice concentrate by approximately 30%. While not all of this price rise may flow through to growers because of the current high stocks held by Australian processors, the growing industry should receive some relief during the current orange harvest. The dumping investigation is continuing and a final decision on the anti-dumping measures is expected in mid March next year.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the current problems being faced by citrus growers because of low priced imports, the Industries Assistance Commission, as part of its long term inquiry into the fruit and fruit produce industries, was asked by the Government to look into the question of temporary assistance for the orange growing industry. The Industries Assistance Commission has recently submitted its report recommending no change be made in the existing and scheduled tariff on orange juice and frozen orange juice concentrate and that citrus growers be encouraged to take advantage of the adjustment, measures available under the Rural Adjustment Scheme. The Government is carefully considering the Commission's report and other information available and will announce a decision on appropriate measures as soon as practicable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) During the period between March 1983 and the establishment of the Australian Trade Commission in January 1986, a Post in Shanghai has been opened and the Johannesburg Post closed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a and b) Pursuant to the powers vested in the Australian Trade Commission under its Act and in the exercise of its commercial judgment, the Australian Trade Commission seeks to focus its resources in geographical regions with the greatest market potential for Australian exporters. In that context, Austrade is currently reviewing the disposition of its overseas resources with a view to achieving their most effective allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> As publically announced recently, Austrade has concluded a review of its operations in the Middle East and Western Europe. Arising from that review was a decision to open a new Trade Commissioner Post in Dubai and expand the scale of its Post to Riyadh.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia-based staff from the former Posts at Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain are being redeployed to new Posts and other regions where there is a greater potential to increase exports of manufactures and services.</PARA>
<PARA> In the future, Austrade's operations in the Arabian Gulf region will be centred upon Riyadh but with local support being provided by the existing Post at Jeddah and the newly opened Post at Dubai. The three Posts will be linked by modern data processing equipment to ensure that Australian exporters are provided with an efficient service that is of a scale compatible with the current market prospects in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> Austrade will be appointing a Trade Commissioner for the Eastern Mediterranean who will service Israel, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus. Competent marketing staff will, where necessary, be engaged locally to work to that Trade Commissioner; current activities of locally engaged staff in Tel Aviv and Athens will be maintained. In consequence, the former Trade Commissioner in Tel Aviv has not been replaced.</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Europe, Austrade's Posts at London and Paris will be strengthened and the Bonn Post transferred to Frankfurt. Frankfurt and Paris will have a greater area of responsibility than previously and along with London will be linked by data processing equipment to Posts such as Stockholm, The Hague, Brussels and Madrid which, it is intended, will in due course be managed by locally engaged marketing experts rather than Australia-based Trade Commissioners. The nature of Austrade's representation in Italy is under consideration with Austrade.</PARA>
<PARA> These changes will result in a strengthening of market research and a better operational focus within both the Middle East and Western Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> A similar review is currently being made of Austrade's resources in the Americas. I anticipate that the Managing Director of Austrade will shortly announce the results of that review.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a and b) The Commission is satisfied that the changes outlined above represent a more cost effective deployment of resources than previously existed and comply with its legislative responsibility to provide its services as efficiently and economically as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The average staffing level limit for the Australian Trade Commission for the period to the 30 June 1986 was 1,327. The actual staff employed at 30 June was 1,334.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) Employees of the Australian Trade Commission are employed under the Australian Trade Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA> 644 of the Commission's current employees were previously employed under the Public Service Act within the Department of Trade.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) With the formation of the Australian Trade Commission, those Trade Commissioners appointed under the former Trade Commissioners Act whose primary responsibilities were associated with marketing were transferred to the Australian Trade Commission. The Department retained responsibility for those appointees who were primarily engaged in trade policy activities or general agricultural matters and they are employed under the Trade Representatives Act 1985. As at 20 May 1986, there were 137 Trade Commissioners and 19 Trade Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) and (b) In accordance with the provisions of the Australian Trade Commission (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985 137 Trade Commissioners were deemed to be employed by the Australian Trade Commission. Of these 77 were from the Public Service and 60 are employed on term appointments.</PARA>
<PARA> All appointees under the Trade Representatives Act had, as at 20 May 1986, public service status.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Appointees under the Trade Representatives Act are subject to terms and conditions set down by the Public Service Board.</PARA>

<PARA>* By virtue of the provisions the Australian Trade Commission (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985 the Trade Commissioners Act 1933 was amended and has become the Trade Representatives Act 1933. From 6 January 1986 persons employed under the Trade Commissioners Act 1933 have been deemed to be employed by the Australian Trade Commission. Therefore the Trade Commissioner Service as an autonomous unit has been subsumed into the wider activities of the Commission and there is now no distinction made between employees. However, as the title of Trade Commissioner is understood and accepted by the Commission's clients, it will continue to be used by managerial staff while on posting overseas.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) (3) and (7) The number of Australian fishing vessels and any operational restrictions applying to fishing within the territorial sea are the responsibilities of the respective State/Territory Governments. Beyond that the Commonwealth is generally responsible for fishing activity, out to the limit of the 200 nautical mile Australian fishing zone (AFZ).</PARA>
<PARA> There are approximately 4700 and 3500 boats licenced to operate off Queensland and New South Wales respectively. Of these about 3100 are also licenced to fish in Commonwealth waters.</PARA>
<PARA> At present there are restrictions on the issue of new Commowealth fishing licences for operations in developed fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to Australian fishing boats, Japanese tuna longline vessels are permitted to operate in specified AFZ waters, including some waters adjacent to the east coast. There are no other foreign fishing boats permitted to operate in those waters. The Japanese boats fish under the terms and conditions of annually negotiated access agreements and under the current agreement up to 290 are permitted to fish in the AFZ. The agreement specifies the areas of operation but generally those foreign boats are permitted to operate off the east coast of mailand Australia north of Latitude 34 degrees south. The Japanese longline fleet is also permitted to operate in AFZ waters around Tasmania. No foreign fishing is permitted within territorial seas and Japanese boats may not operate within approximately 50 nautical miles of the NSW coast during January to March (from Sydney to Coffs Harbour).</PARA>
<PARA> As noted above up to 290 Japanese vessels may be licensed but in 1985/86 only 265 Japanese boats applied to be and were so licensed. Of those, only 154 operated in the AFZ. The foreign vessels are licensed to operate in the areas specified in access agreements and there are no areas allocated to particular boats. In respect of Japanese fishing in waters adjacent to NSW some 80-100 vessels operate during the peak of the season.</PARA>
<PARA> Japanese vessels, like all foreign vessels which operate in the AFZ (ie. from the Republic of Korea and Taiwan), are required to adhere to a range of reporting requirements designed to safeguard the interests of the Australian fishing industry and to protect the marine resources of the Zone. They are also required to place Australian observers aboard as requested.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign fishing vessels operating in the AFZ are subject to Australian law but there are no additional constraints on their operations beyond those specified in the agreements. The usual reason for operational restrictions is either to protect fish stocks or to prevent instances of gear conflict (ie cases in which foreign fishing interferes with domestic operations). The tunas which constitute the target species of the east coast longlines are classified as ``highly migratory species'' which are taken not only in the AFZ but throughout the region. In the case of southern bluefin tuna, restrictions on access in the AFZ have been imposed because of scientific concern about depletion of the stocks. The exclusion of Japanese long- liners from most AFZ waters south of latitude 34 degrees south and the implementation of global catch quotas reflects our concern at the heavy fishing effort applied to that species.</PARA>
<PARA> We have always consulted with State/Territory Governments and industry organisations prior to and during access negotiations and, since the proclamation of the AFZ in 1979, areas available to foreign fleets have been progressively reduced as the Australian fishing industry has expanded its range of operations.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the Australian fishing fleets the two main fisheries off the east coast-the East Coast Trawl Fishery and the South Eastern Trawl Fishery-are both subject to management plans with approximately 180 boats permitted to operate in the South Eastern Trawl fishery and some 1200 in the East Coast Trawl Fishery.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are currently no limits applying to the lengths of lines which may be used by Australian or Japanese vessels operating off the NSW coast. In respect of Australian vessels, while there are at present no restriction on line length, management arrangements for the east coast yellowfin/bigeye longline fishery are under consideration. While the East Coast Tuna Management Advisory Committee has yet to make its recommendations I would expect that gear restrictions (such as the maximum line length) will be an option examined.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Foreign fishing in the AFZ may be classified as either bilateral or joint venture. All foreign fishing vessels are liable to pay an access fee, a vessel fee of $35/metre overall and a master fisherman's licence fee of $20. In some cases, such as that of Japanese longline operations under the bilateral agreement, the vessel and master fisherman's licence fees are subsumed in the total fee paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Joint ventures, that is, fishing operations which involve Australian and foreign partners, may provide wider benefits to the Australian community and under the Fisheries Act the Minister for Primary Industry is empowered to waive all or part of the access fee.</PARA>
<PARA> Access fees are usually based on a negotiated percentage of the landed value of the catch in the major market. In 1985/86 the access fee paid by Japan was $2.25 million; in 1986/87, $3.15 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Under the Commonwealth Fisheries Act, 1952 Australian and foreign fishing boats required a Commowealth Fishing Boat Licence and the person in charge of a fishing vessel, operating in Commonwealth waters, must hold a Master Fisherman's Licence. Boats operating within State waters may be required to hold State fishing licences and marine authorities may require boat operators to hold other licences which are not related directly to fishing activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Foreign fisherman who operate in the AFZ do so subject to their compliance with a range of reporting requirements involving logbooks, positions/catch reporting etc. Means of ensuring that foreign vessels adhere to specified conditions include primary surveillance by RAN and RAAF vehicles as well as secondary surveillance by Australian fishing vessels, merchant ships, commercial aircraft etc. I have already referred to observers aboard foreign fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The New South Wales Department of Agriculture is responsible for administration of the regulations in respect of the fishing operations of Australian vessels in the territorial sea while the Australian Fisheries Service of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry assumes that the responsibility for fishing operations in proclaimed waters beyond the territorial sea and out to the limit of the AFZ.</PARA>
<PARA> Other authorities may cover the non fisheries-specific aspects such as navigation (Commonwealth Department of Transport) and survey and safety requirements (State Marine Boards, etc).</PARA>

<PARA>1. The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) has derived from its published annual financial statements estimates of expenditure, including salary costs, directed to its export marketing function. The large increase in costs between 1984/85 and 1985/86 is due primarily to the commencement of silo construction projects in Egypt directly related to the marketing of Australia's wheat in that country.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The Australian Dairy Corporation advises that the variation between 1980-81 and 1981-82 was caused by a significant reduction in promotion activity in Japan, resulting from a decline in the level of milk production in Australia and a consequent fall in the volume of cheese available for export to Japan.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Is he able to say whether studies by the Swedish State Power Board show safety margins at the Ignalina facility to be smaller than those in operation at the Chernobyl plant at the time of the nuclear disaster; if so, what representations has the Government made through the International Atomic Energy Agency to rectify the situation in light of the Government's comments following the Chernobyl disaster.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The nuclear reactors at the Ignalina Power Station are of a type designated RBMK-1500. The type is a development of the RBMK-1000 reactor which was involved in the accident at Chernobyl. Appendix 1 of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission's report on the Chernobyl accident, ``The Chernobyl Nuclear Accident and Its Consequences'', tabled in both Houses of Parliament on 24 September 1986, contains background on the Ignalina Power Station.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) An internal report by the Swedish State Power Board has suggested that the safety margins against a melt-down at Ignalina are probably very small, and that the design, as with other RBMK type reactors, would not meet Swedish safety requirements. The report has no official status, and is of a tentative nature, relying on the few technical details publicly available. It is understood that the State Power Board has not been able to obtain sufficient information from the Soviet Union to be able to verify the report's assumptions and modelling.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the speculative and tentative nature of the report, it would be inappropriate for the Australian Government to make representations to the Soviet Union at this stage. It is in the first instance for Sweden to decide on possible follow-up action.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia took an active role in international action in the wake of the Chernobyl accident to encourage additional action on nuclear safety. At an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting of experts to review the Chernobyl accident held in Vienna on 25-29 August, the Soviet Union tabled a detailed report on the accident sequence, the reasons for it and its consequences, and demonstrated a readiness to answer additional detailed questions on the accident. The Government hopes that the Soviet Union, and other countries operating nuclear facilities, will maintain and extend the provision of safety-related information on nuclear facilities to assist in the overall development of an improved nuclear safety regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The High Court Case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen arose from a proposal by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission to purchase the Archer River Pastoral Lease for the Winychanham group resident at Aurukun and elsewhere in Queensland. The purchase required consent under the Lands Act (Qld), which was not forthcoming. The High Court held that section 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1979 (Cth) was within Commonwealth Constitutional power, and referred to the Queensland Supreme Court the issue of whether the decision of the Queensland Government to refuse to consent to the purchase was invalid as contrary to section 9 of the Commonwealth Act</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government then declared the Archer River Pastoral Lease land to be a National Park and action in the Supreme Court therefore did not proceed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the request of the general aviation industry, the Government agreed to defer introduction of separate airport and airway landing charges to general aviation. Under arrangements agreed with general aviation industry associations, all general aviation operators are to receive trial bills during 1986-87. The trial bills show charges that would have been payable under the new separate airport and airways landing charges system. They are intended to provide information to enable the Government, in consultation with the industry, to develop appropriate charging arrangements for general aviation from 1 July 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3), (6) and (7) There have been no additional staff employed for dual running over and above the staff required to operate the new separate airport and airway landing charges system.</PARA>
<PARA> International and domestic airlines and other aircraft predominantly used in regular public transport operations have been charged under the new system from 1 July 1986. Information to generate actual bills to airlines and trial bills to general aviation is gathered as part of the one exercise. It is not possible to separately identify the costs of collecting and processing data for general aviation operations. Accordingly all staffing and costs figures set out below relate to the full cost of operating the landing charges system for both airlines and general aviation.</PARA>

<PARA> In considering the above costings it is important to bear in mind that, in the light of certain criticisms by the Auditor-General of the lack of effective audit controls under the previous system it would not have been possible to retain the previous system. The new landing charges system was developed on the basis of advice from independent financial consultants.</PARA>
<PARA> All costs are to be absorbed within the Department's 2 per cent expenditure reduction target for 1986-87. Moreover, it is confidently expected that the developments in train in modernising the airways system will provide the scope for substantial savings in the more labour intensive components of the new charging system. Ultimately, the new system could well be significantly cheaper to run than the old.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In answer to representations I have received from the pig industry and veterinary organisations, and following a meeting with their representatives, I advised both the Australian Pork Producers Federation and the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) that I had asked the Canadian agricultural authorities to undertake transmission trials to establish whether transmissible gastroenteritis could be present in the meat of slaughter age pigs in Canada. The Canadian Minister for Agriculture has since advised me that they see no value in such trials as they would, in their view, be time consuming, expensive and unlikely to add to current knowledge of the disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In considering the latest advice from Canada, and following discussions with industry, the AVA and scientific staff from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) I have asked my Department, in conjunction with industry and AAHL, to consider the feasibility and desirability of organising transmission trials at AAHL. If no agreed experimental protocol, which would advance the knowledge of transmission of TGE and assist in decision making, can be developed, I will decide on the importation on the basis of available evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No-my advice is that TGE does not pose a risk to human health.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In its April 1986 Economic and Rural Policy Statement, the Government announced that the relationship between the proposed Horticultural Marketing Corporation and the three existing marketing authorities responsible for apples and pears, canned deciduous fruits and dried vine fruits would be resolved in consultation with the industries involved. In September 1986, the Department of Primary Industry published a discussion paper entitled New Commercial Structure for the Horticultural Industries outlining ways in which the proposal for establishing the Horticultural Marketing Corporation and related institutions may be implemented and the horticultural industries were invited to comment on the paper's contents.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, consultations with many industries have taken place and are continuing. In particular, representations have been made either to the Department or to me by organisations within the apple and pear, canned fruit and dried fruit industries. It is expected that the initial round of consultations between my Department and industry organisations will be concluded soon. These consultations have centred on the main principles governing the establishment of the proposed institutions. I hope soon to be in a position to make a statement on the proposals, taking into account all the views presented by the industries in the consultations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) There has been no decision taken to abolish the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation (ADFC). The main industry organisation has presented arguments that the ADFC should continue as a separate entity. As mentioned above, consultations with the industry are continuing on whether or not dried fruits should come within the responsibility of the proposed Horticultural Marketing Corporation. As soon as possible after the conclusion of the current round of industry consultations, I will give a considered response to the representations made by the organisations within the dried fruits industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Discussions with Qantas were initiated over one year ago, involving the Government's Advertising Service, my department and the advertising agency which was to produce the film, and included two special presentations to Qantas' Manager of Inflight Entertainment. An independent market research evaluation of the video was prepared specifically to assess the impact on in-flight audiences and this evaluation was conveyed to Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA> These consultations culminated in a letter from my department to Qantas' Manager of Inflight Entertainment, which advised him of my approval of the film and enclosed the script. Qantas replied raising only details of timing and payments. It was reasonable to understand from this exchange of correspondence that Qantas had no difficulty with the film content; the film was made.</PARA>
<PARA> The specific dates of these events were:</PARA>
<PARA> 30 October 1985-first contact with Qantas</PARA>
<PARA> 18 February 1986-presentation to Qantas</PARA>
<PARA> 7 March 1986-presentation to Qantas</PARA>

<PARA> 22 April 1986-formal letter to Qantas</PARA>
<PARA> 26 May 1986-Qantas reply</PARA>
<PARA> 30 May 1986-film made</PARA>
<PARA> My department was, therefore, surprised to be informed at a meeting on 11 September 1986 that Qantas then found the film unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The film, which is suitable for showing as a community service, not only for in-flight screening to airline passengers on flights out of Australia, but also for showing domestically on television and in cinemas, was launched at a press conference on 14 October by Dr Blewett, the Minister for Health, and myself. There has been a gratifying response from television stations throughout Australia to the screening of the film in community service timeslots and the Greater Union Cinema chain is showing it in four States and the A.C.T.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Officers of my department and the Government's Advertising Service have asked MAS, Garuda, Philippines Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai International if they wish to screen the film on a non-commercial charge basis. Resident Australian missions in those countries have been briefed so that they can discuss this approach with local authorities. Cathay Pacific Airways have been approached on the same basis. I might mention also that the Canadian and Malaysian administrations have shown interest in using the film for their own drug warning campaigns.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Yes, although the Government understands that the United States had two ground-based direct intercept anti-satellite systems in operational or semi-operational status at Pacific island locations until the mid 1970s. The Government further understands that these two systems were also in part a response to United States concerns in the late 1960s that the Soviet Union was developing a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) According to the official United States publication Soviet Strategic Defence Programs, published in October 1985, the United States considers that the Soviet Union's co-orbital anti-satellite system became operational in the early 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no dispute that the Soviet Union possesses the world's only operational anti-ballistic missile defence system, centred on Moscow. This system is permitted by the ABM Treaty and, as required by the Treaty, it is fixed and ground-based. It is not the Government's impression that the existence of this system means that the Soviet Union holds an advantage in ``Star Wars'' technology. ``Star Wars'' concentrates on advanced technologies such as directed energy devices like lasers and kinetic energy systems of sufficient accuracy to allow a conventional warhead or no warhead at all. The existing Soviet system continues to employ ground based missiles with nuclear warheads, as did the system which the United States discarded in the mid 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) The Soviet Union does not normally make such information available but according to Soviet Strategic Defence Programs, (pp. 7-8) the Soviet Union has been upgrading the Moscow anti-ballistic missile system since 1980 with new radars, an improved version of the existing long-range exo-atmospheric interceptor missile and a new short-range, high acceleration interceptor missile. The total number of launchers for interceptor missiles has been increased from 64 to 100, the maximum number permitted under the ABM Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) the Government is not in a position to say whether construction of the Krasnoryarsk radar has been accelerated.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Government has stated that it believes the Soviet Union has a case to answer in respect of United States allegations that the Krasnoryarsk radar violates the ABM Treaty. It has urged the Soviet Union to demonstrate compliance with that Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Government understands that any system capable of locating and destroying incoming missiles could also destroy any satellites that come within its range.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Soviet Union does not normally make such information available but according to Soviet Strategic Defence Programs (p. 16) the Soviet Union has ground-based lasers that could possibly damage some sensors on US satellites.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) It would be more accurate to say that General Ogarkov advocated the development, among other things, of credible ballistic missile defences and anti-satellite weapons and implied that the Soviet Union was working on such systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No record of this particular quotation has been found but lasers, both experimental and operational have been in existence in all industrially advanced countries for many years. They have widespread civilian as well as military uses.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) The Government is not in a position to compare the size of the laser programs in the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet Strategic Defence Programs (p. 12) the Soviet research program into advanced technologies for defence against ballistic missiles represents a ``far greater investment of plant space, capital and manpower'' than is the case with Strategic Defence Initiative. Clearly this comparison includes but is not confined to laser programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Soviet Union does not normally make such information available but the Government is aware of US estimates that the Soviet Union's laser program involves over 10,000 scientists and engineers and if conducted in the US, would cost roughly US$1 billion per year (Soviet Strategic Defence Programs, pp. 12-13).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) It is difficult to give a definitive answer for at least three reasons (i) the secrecy which surrounds Soviet activity in this field; (ii) the vagueness to date of the Soviet proposals as to what activity it seeks to have confined to laboratories and what it understands in this context by the word ``laboratory''; and (iii) the fact that the ABM Treaty allows work on ballistic missile defences-including work on systems based on new physical principles-to be taken further than the lab- oratory provided the systems are fixed and ground-based.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Government does not endorse the SDI or what it considers to be a comparable program in the USSR. The Government has taken this position because it saw grave risk that the vigorous pursuit of strategic defences at the present juncture would inhibit the conclusion of new agreements to reduce the offensive nuclear forces and lead to the competive development and deployment of weapon systems for use in space. The Government is strongly opposed to the extension of the arms race into outer space. Apart from expressing these views publicly and directly to both the United States and the Soviet Union, the Government has urged them to reach an accommodation on these matters before irrevisible steps are taken. The Government has urged full and demonstrable compliance with the ABM Treaty and, has suggested, an extended period of non-withdrawal from the Treaty and negotiations to bring up-to-date the understandings on what activities can be pursued under the Treaty. The Government takes some encouragement from the fact that these propositions now form part of the agenda of the negotiations between the US and the USSR.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It was recently estimated in the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report on `The Chemicals and Plastics Industries', 30 May 1986, that around 70 per cent of agricultural chemicals are sold to the rural sector, suggesting a market with a value of about $220m in 1983/84.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1983/84, expenditure on agricultural and veterinary chemicals made up almost 5 per cent of total farm cash costs on average, with wheat about 6.5% and horticulture (including fruitgrowing) about 6.7%. (See Table A14.5 prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) and included in the IAC report at page 420). In addition BAE survey data indicate expenditure on agricultural chemicals within the cotton industry in 1983/84 at 16.6% of total farm costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The general rate of tariffs which applied to imports of finished chemicals and primary chemicals (used in further processing), which appear under several tariff items, ranges between 0 to 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Revenue figures for tariffs raised on imported chemicals used on farms are not available. The classification of tariff items tends to be compound specific rather than end use descriptive and as agriculture chemicals comprise a number of chemical compounds, listed under separate tariff codes, calculations of revenue would require considerable resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) On 1 January 1987 tariff levels will be the same as currently applies. However, the Minister for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce announced on 30 October 1986 that a reduction in tariff rates to a level of 15% or below, would be phased in over a three to five year period from 1 February 1987. Some tariff levels currently below 15% will be increased to either 10 or 15% to eliminate certain anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA> The changes which have been announced are expected to reduce the overall level of tariffs on imported agricultural chemicals by some $2-4 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Access to Australian works in the performing arts is an important element in the development of our cultural identity. I strongly support initiatives taken by the Australia Council to encourage their production and performance, details of which are outlined below.</PARA>
<PARA>Music Board</PARA>
<PARA> The Board pursues the Australian content objective in all styles of music.</PARA>
<PARA> Support for Australian performances commences with assistance for Australian composers which has increased from $136,000 in 1983 to $423,000 in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Board increased support to the Australian Music Centre, which has the task of promoting Australian composers. In 1986 the Centre received grants totalling $278,515.</PARA>
<PARA> In performance, the Board gives emphasis to supporting groups which specialise in the performance of contemporary works, especially Australian works.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Board encourages all other applicants to include a proportion of Australian content appropriate to their activities and it has informed the music community that the size of grants is affected by the level of Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA> In community music, the Board supports a composer in residence in the community program. It has also funded musicians in residence programs, for instance in folk music, in which song writing skills are passed into a community and encouragement is given to express local concerns through song.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Board's Australian content objective, The Australian Opera has begun a consistent and continuing program of performance of Australian works, and it presented two full small scale works in 1985, plus a national opera ``workshop'' to test out new works (planned now to be offered annually). In 1986 it has presented the full main-stage production of Voss. The company has also commissioned a new music theatre work for 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>Theatre Board</PARA>
<PARA> As its main policy objective, the Board supports theatre arts which relate to the Australian experience. A major example of this policy is the Board's support of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust's Australian Content Program which has been funded since 1982 and in 1985-86 it received $214,000 for a program which facilitated performances of several Australian productions, both in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>Community Arts Board</PARA>
<PARA> This Board also provides support and encouragement for the performance of Australian work in the area of community theatre and music projects. Examples of recent such projects are the residency by the Theatre South company in the Southern NSW town of Eden, to develop a play relating to themes about the area; and the touring theatre program by Mainstreet through rural South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Arts Board</PARA>
<PARA> This Board encourages the performance of the best professional work to emerge in theatre, dance and music among Aboriginal people. The Board supports traditional dance and music through grants for ceremonial activities and community festivals in tribal areas. Non-traditional/contemporary performing arts activities are supported through: assistance to the Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Scheme to conduct a national dance training school; grants for theatre script development, workshops and production activities; and funding for Aboriginal country music festivals.</PARA>
<PARA>Liaison with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Australia Council has worked with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to develop a policy statement on the arts. This policy statement gives priority to, amongst other things, encouraging Australian composers and musicians through presentation in performance, competitions and orchestra workshops.</PARA>
<PARA>National Institute of Dramatic Art</PARA>
<PARA> Another organisation within my portfolio concerned with the performing arts-the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA)-encourages the performance of Australian works. NIDA conducts a part-time course for playwrights and at the end of each year plays emanating from this course are performed by the students. NIDA has also commissioned two new Australian plays for 1987 and 1988 and graduating actors performed in a production of ``Golden Age'' by Louis Nowra, a major Australian play, in August 1986.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth encourages the purchase and/or commissioning of works of art for public buildings in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA> Artbank, a program administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment, promotes the development and appreciation of Australian art by the acquisition of art works by Australian artists. The works of art acquired are made available to clients by rental for display in locations accessible to the public, such as Government offices and private business throughout Australia and Australian overseas posts.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1984-85 a total of 438 new works were acquired by Artbank for a sum of $319,000. 90% of the total 3,456 piece Artbank collection was on hire at the end of 1984-85 and the rental income generated for the year was $275,000.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1984-85 Artbank spent $33,850 on the purchase of artworks requested by client Government departments for display in new Commonwealth buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Housing and Construction may make provision for works of art in new Commonwealth buildings to a maximum of 0.5% of project cost subject to agreement by the client and approval by the Government. There is close consultation with Artbank in the case of portable works of art and with the Australia Council in the case of fixed works.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Capital Development Commission makes provision for works of art in appropriate public buildings and places as part of the integrated development of Canberra. Such works are located in areas where they will be accessible to a maximum audience across the community.</PARA>
<PARA> In consultation with the Australia Council and the Department of Housing and Construction, the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment is reviewing current arrangements with a view to encouraging greater use of art works in public buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth does not have details of possible State Government programs to encourage the purchase and/or commissioning of works of art as part of public building programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has sought advice from all other portfolios on the sums spent by the Commonwealth during 1984-85 on the acquisition or commissioning of works of art for Commonwealth buildings:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in 1984-85 approximately $1,113,000 was spent by the Commission on the aquisition or commissioning of works of art for new Commonwealth buildings; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in 1984-85 approximately $129,875 was spent on works of art for existing Commonwealth buildings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An Environment Contaminants and Coordination Division has been established within the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment. This Division is developing and implementing, in conjunction with other Commonwealth and State government agencies, the range of functions which are envisaged in the Federal Platform of the Australian Labor Party for an Environmental Contaminants Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not considered appropriate to establish at this stage a statutory authority to perform these functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am unaware of an inquiry by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) into allegedly hazardous agricultural chemicals. However, I am advised that the NH &amp; MRC, which advises the Minister for Health, reviews potential hazards of agricultural chemicals as new information becomes available. The current review of organochlorine pesticides is an example of this process. My Department has recently taken on the role of environmental assessment of agricultural chemicals notified under the national clearance system operated by the Australian Agricultural Council.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NF4">Mr Cohen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the 9th Session of the World Heritage Convention (2-6 December 1985), the World Heritage Committee considered that more active measures should be taken to ensure that contributions to the World Heritage Fund be made by State Parties on a more regular basis than in the past in order to allow it to plan its activities more effectively. Accordingly the Director-General wrote to all State Parties to the World Heritage Convention on 20 and 24 March 1986, inviting them to pay their contributions to the World Heritage Fund, at as early a date as possible in each calendar year. In the case of Australia's contribution, Unesco requested that it be paid in two instalments during the biennium with each instalment representing the contribution for the respective calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The 1985-86 Budget appropriation was sufficient to enable payment of the 1985 contributions. The 1986-87 Budget appropriation had to be supplemented to enable payment of the 1986 contribution. It should be noted, however that even with the requirement for additional funds the 1986 contribution was paid at approximately the same time of year as the 1984 and 1985 contributions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Expenditure above or below an annual allocation is not necessarily adjusted in the succeeding year. The 1985-86 Federal Budget provided for States to expend $20 million in excess of expected revenue receipts to redress some of the variation between State and category revenue shares and actual expenditure in earlier years.</PARA>
<PARA>While differences may occur between allocations and expenditures in any given financial year total expenditure over the life of the program is expected to accord with total category revenue shares as provided for under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) States are advised each year of the total payments to be made under the program and of their nominal category allocations. State category allocations are based on shares of estimated revenue and may include adjustment to redress some of the past variation between revenue shares and actual expenditure in earlier years. Allocations to categories and States are indicative only and can be varied. States have within any year the flexibility to achieve their overall expenditure targets by varying category expenditure levels. It is also possible to increase payments to higher spending States if others under expend their allocations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Action on Special Reports to Parliament made by the Ombudsman under section 17 of the Ombudsman Act is a matter for the Parliament and not the Executive.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that on 22 August 1986, the Senate referred both the Ombudsman's Special Reports to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As I stated in my letter of 19 December 1985 to the Acting Ombudsman, (reproduced at Attachment 3 to the Ombudsman's Special Report No. 2), the Commonwealth cannot responsibly accept additional standards of liability which do not fall upon the Australian commercial community in general; and that it is not unreasonable to suggest that if compensation were paid in this case, there would be created a general expectation that the Commonwealth is prepared to compensate in similar cases.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I understand that the Department of Finance is aware of a number of similar instances. It is not necessarily the case that all such instances are reported either to that Department or to my own Department or to the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The redress available for administrative deficiencies subject to the Ombudsman Act is clearly spelt out in the Act. Under that Act, such redress includes investigations of complaints, reports and recommendations to departments or authorities under section 15; the furnishing of information to the Prime Minister with regard to such reports under section 16; and the forwarding of such reports to the Parliament under section 17. Action taken on Ombudsman recommendations or reports will depend on the facts and surrounding circumstances of each case.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The reasons are spelt out in my letter of 19 December 1985 to the Acting Ombudsman (see Attachment 3 to Special Report No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) I understand that the Department of Defence has taken steps to ensure that a situation similar to what occurred in the ISM case does not arise in the future. I am advised that an instruction has been issued in that Department to ensure that comparative statements of tendered prices and other information are double-checked against original tender documents.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) I understand that in relation to the particular aspects of the matter put to the Deputy Crown Solicitor, the basis of his advice was that, as no contract had ever been formed, no liability in contract had arisen. Moreover, I understand that in relation to those same aspects the Deputy Crown Solicitor did not consider that Commonwealth liability in negligence arose because of:</PARA>
<PARA> an absence of duty of care in normal commercial tendering situations;</PARA>
<PARA> an uncertainty of the extent of liability for negligence in the exercise of statutory powers;</PARA>
<PARA> the unlikelihood of recovery for economic loss where no physical damage arises; and</PARA>
<PARA> the absence of compensable damage suffered by ISM.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a letter of 12 August 1986 to the Premiers, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the President of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations I noted that the Commonwealth would offer redeployment to as many of the staff of ACIR as possible but that the need for some compulsory retirements might arise.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event, legal and practical constraints limited the scope for direct assistance by the Commonwealth regarding permanent or ongoing temporary employment. Only one staff member was eligible for redeployment but elected not to exercise that right. His right of re-entry arose out of former employment in the Australian Public Service (APS). Under the relevant Public Service determination other staff could only be employed through selection for APS positions publicly advertised.</PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Board (PSB) held discussions with staff of ACIR to provide assistance in identifying and pursuing available APS positions, and has continued to provide such assistance. The PSB also extended the closing date for Assistant Research Officer positions to enable ACIR staff to apply.</PARA>
<PARA> At the winding-up of ACIR all staff took advantage of the redundancy package approved by ACIR. Since then I am aware that at least one former staff member has obtained other employment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is understood that there are various Selstay sale plans. These involve the arranged sale of the home at an agreed value to a private individual. The vendor receives a proportion of the sale price at the time of sale, a right to accommodation in the home for life or such shorter period as he or she wishes and payment of the balance of the sale price when vacant possession occurs. Rent is payable to the landlord throughout the period of residence.</PARA>
<PARA> On the information available, the scheme appears to involve selling the home, an asset which is exempt for pension purposes, for a consideration which includes the right to continue to occupy it for life. The security of tenure inherent in that right means that the pensioner would continue to qualify under the assets test as a home owner and accordingly the value of the right to occupy the home would be disregarded. Regard would be had to the deposit received if retained in the form of an assessable asset and a value would be placed on the outstanding debt.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Following a countervailing case brought by the Australian Dairy Industry Conference against EC cheese imports the European Community gave an undertaking (which was accepted by the Australian Government in November 1983) to reduce export refunds on certain cheeses initially by an amount corresponding to the Australian stabilisation levy on cheddar type cheeses. It also stated its objective of ensuring that the prices of these cheeses would not disturb the Australian market. On 16 May 1986 the European Community increased export subsidies on certain cheeses for shipment to Australia by up to 180%. This action was taken by the EC Commission after EC traders had complained that their share of the Australian market was being eroded as a result of the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the fact that export refunds had not been adjusted for a considerable time. The Australian Government sought formal consultations with the EC Commission on the issue under the provisions of the 1983 Undertaking. These were held in Brussels between Australian and EC Commission officials on 14 and 17 July and 6 and 7 October 1986. The matter was discussed during the Australia EC Ministerial meetings held in Canberra on 10 to 12 November 1986.</PARA>
