It is difficult for us in the coalition parties, and I know for many of his friends in the Labor Party, to come to grips with the fact that, when the parliament last met, as I answered questions and took part in debate I would look around and see Peter Nugent sitting in the seat which is now marked by a floral tribute. On behalf of all of the members of the parliament, I want to say to Carol, his widow, who is in the gallery, Deirdre, his daughter, and her husband, Ian, Barry, his son, and his wife Mandy, Christopher and David, two of his grandsons, and also his very devoted staff members Judy Logan and Sandra Rae, how saddened we are by Peter's death, how much we admire the contribution that he made to this parliament and to public life and how much we feel for you in your very great loss. </para><para>In a way it is typical and to be expected that, if you should die as a serving member of parliament, you do so, as Peter did, immediately after a fundraiser for your own party and immediately after having returned from a very busy parliamentary delegation to China. It was some hours after Peter's death when Michael Ronaldson, our Chief Government Whip, rang me to tell me that Peter had died, and I learnt that he had been at a fundraiser in the electorate of Aston the night before with the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. When I spoke a few hours later to Carol, she described circumstances and events at that gathering so typical of the experience of all of us over a long period of time.</para><para>Peter was born on 1 April 1938 at Chelmsford in the United Kingdom. At the age of 16 he enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He served in Britain, Cyprus and Singapore and he retired with the rank of squadron leader after 24 years of service. He settled in Australia in 1977 and he then began a marketing and sales director career with a computing and information technology company. He had a great interest in politics. He joined the Liberal Party in 1980 and was Liberal Party branch president from 1982 to 1989. In 1983 he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe in Victoria. But he persisted, as so many of us did and do, and, not to be deterred, he was elected in 1990 along with some eight other Liberals in Victoria in that election. The seat had been held by the Labor Partyâby John Saunderson, I thinkâbetween 1984 and 1990, and Peter has held it in differing political circumstances ever since. </para><para>He became a member of an honoured class in the Liberal Party experienceâparticularly for those from Victoria, because of the large number of members who came in from Victoria in that electionâthe class of 1990. In his maiden speech in May 1990, he pointed out that no other electorate in Australia had more households paying mortgages than his seat of Aston. It was, in every sense of the phrase, a quintessential mortgage belt seat. On that occasion, he spoke of the need to focus on the areas that affected the daily lives of Australians, typically the lives of people he represented from the division of Aston.</para><para>He was re-elected on three occasions in a very marginal seat. Any man or woman who does that from any side of politics deserves our respect. There are different categories of members: there are those who have the good fortune to represent very safe seats; there are those who have the challenging and character forming existence representing more marginal seats; and there are those who are somewhere in the middle who slip from the first category into the second and hope to climb back from the second into the first. Peter always regarded the seat he held as marginal. He always regarded it as an incredible honour to be a member of the national parliament.</para><para>Peter Nugent was a person of very strong views. In a broadly based political party such as the party I have the honour to lead, there is a variety of views on many subjects. Peter was passionately committed to human rights issues. He had a very deep and abiding and very impressive knowledge of foreign affairs and defence matters. He was extremely committed to the process of Aboriginal reconciliation. From 1991 to 1997 he served as a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. His convictions were evidenced by the active role he took in his membership of many committees and delegations. He was a person who treated his obligations and responsibilities as a member of parliament and as a member of the parliamentary Liberal Party very seriously and conscientiously.</para><para>Peter and I did not always agree. On some issues he regarded me as being too conservative. He regarded me as somebody who perhaps on particular issues had not approached them with the same attitude that he brought to them. We sometimes disagreed. In the past we even quarrelled, but over the years a very deep respect grew and I found in him a person of great candour and honesty and very great dignity. In this political life, you can always respect a person, whatever views they hold on any issue, if they hold them conscientiously and state them with candour, decency and forthrightness. Peter agonised over a number of issues which we have struggled with as a government and as a parliament over recent years. He agonised over the challenge which the coalition parties faced in relation to the native title legislationâa very difficult piece of legislation. He contributed in a very effective way to debates on that issue within our party room. I believe he was able to properly reconcile, as so many can, both the concerns he had about the policy issues involved and also the very deep commitment he had to the Liberal Party.</para><para>He was a person who understood very well the character of Australian politics. The last function I attended for Peter in his electorate last year was a fundraiser, a luncheon at a local reception placeâthe sort of function that has been familiar to so many of us over the years, to be found virtually anywhere in Australia. Before the time came for me to deliver the speech and answer questions, we chatted for quite some time about the different policy issues facing the coalition, facing our country and facing the parliament. I thought he analysed very succinctly and intelligently the range of views we find on some of these issues, not only within our own party and between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party but also within different sections of the Liberal Party according to which part of the country you came from. In the discussion he showed, as he had shown on so many other occasions, a very deep understanding of the nature of the political process.  </para><para>He was very proud of his electorate and he was very proud of his capacity to communicate to this parliament and to his parliamentary colleagues the character of his electorate. He was one of the most fantastically well organised local members I have ever visited. When you are the leader, you go into a lot of electorate offices. Some of them are very well organisedâall on this side of the House are very well organised, Mr Speaker. Over the years I have come across the odd one which was not so well organised, but not Peter's. He ran a very effective ship, not just a tight ship. His electorate office was dedicated 24 hours a day to the service of the people of Aston. When we went to his funeral, many of us had the experience of meeting people from the community, right across the spectrum, including people who said, `We didn't necessarily share his politics, but we thought he did a fantastic job for the people of Aston.' It was a great tribute to his work, and I hope of some comfort to Carol and to his children Deirdre, Greg and Barry, to his stepchildren Nicholas, Victoria and Sarah and to all the other people and staff members who were his friends and his support.</para><para>Peter left quite an impression on his parliamentary colleagues. He was respected and liked by all, and particularly by his colleagues from Victoria. The regular flight which carried so many Victorian members of both persuasions to parliament at the commencement of sittings is different and the poorer and the sadder as a result of Peter's death.</para><para>Can I say, through you, Mr Speaker, to Carol: we love and admire your strength and the dignified way in which, through very difficult circumstances, you have so graciously reached out to many people who have been touched by his death and, even more significantly, who have been impressed by his life. </para><para>We have lost a very good friend. The Liberal Party in Victoria and throughout Australia has lost a fine local member. The Australian parliament has lost a strong advocate of the cause of the disadvantaged; a strong proponent of the fundamental values of human society. On behalf of the parliament, on behalf of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, we record our sorrow and we record our thanks to him for his contributions to our parliament. On behalf of the Liberal Party, I thank him for his service to our party. We extend our deep sympathy to Carol, Deirdre and Barry, to his two grandsons and to the extended families and to all other people who were touched in such a direct way by his life.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>26669</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and, on behalf of the opposition, to extend to Carol and the children here and those not here, and to the grandchildren, the heartfelt condolences of the federal parliamentary Labor Party on this very sad occasion. We have had a number of occasions, but not many, when members of this House have died, and when that occurs it is like a death in the family. He will be sadly missedâhe is sadly missed. His sudden death by heart attack on 24 April cut short a notable parliamentary career. As leader of the parliamentary Labor Party, I know I speak for all my colleagues when I say that Peter Nugent stood for the things most Australians view as decent and right. He was a man of principle and he pursued his principles with conviction. He was admired and respected for this by both sides of the House. As a person who has been on the front bench for the decade in which Peter served in this place, I cannot say that I came to know him as closely as did other members on this side of the House, and they will have an opportunity in the discussion which follows to place on record their more personal recollections of his life and their relationships with him; so to a great extent my recollections of Peter will be dominated by what I saw of him in this chamber and what I saw of him in his public presentations and by speeches of his over the years that I have read. </para></talk.start><para>One thing is eminently clear: he was a man totally dedicated to public service. The Prime Minister told us of the fact that Peter served in the Royal Air Force for some 24 years and that he received a General Services Medal in Malaya in 1957. The organisation with which the Prime Minister identified him must have come intensively from that experience as a squadron leader in the Royal Air Force and from the administrative duties he would have pursued there. </para><para>For 10 years, of course, or a bit more, he was a member of this place. In reading through his record as a member of this place, you get a picture of a devoted and competent parliamentarian who took this place and his business seriously. He was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs from May 1990 to May 1992 and of its successor committee, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, from 1992 through to 1993 and then from 1994 to 1996, the gap in that period being when he clearly left it in order to serve on the front bench of the Liberal Party, then in opposition. He was a member also of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology from 1990 to 1993 and then from 1996 to 1998; of the Library Committee from May 1996 to August 1998; of the Procedure Committee from October 1997, being chair from that point to August 1998; of the Committee of Members' Interests from December 1998; of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority from 8 December 1998, and chair from 10 December 1998; and of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade from 18 June 1996, as chair of its Human Rights Subcommittee. </para><para>That is a substantial recordâto have commended yourself to your colleagues in such a way that you are chosen to chair so many important committees and subcommittees. It is probably the record, too, of a person who decided he would accept with good grace that he would not serve for more than that one year on his party's front bench. There are many reasons why people do not do that. Sometimes it is because the competition is intense; sometimes it is because the balances in the party change over time, as the Japanese Emperor said at one point, `not necessarily in your favour'. It is possible also, of course, that there is an unwillingness to serve for a variety of reasons. I cannot say that I knowâobviously I cannot knowâthe reasons why he was not a minister. Those of us on this side of the House who knew him could find few reasons that would adequately explain his absence, but nevertheless there may well have been very good reasons why he was not.</para><para>The stands that he took were noteworthy, and the thing that I find, going back over his record, that is a surprise is the profoundness of his convictions for a man so recently arrived in this country. He was not a man who spent his formative years in Australia, not even a very substantial proportion of his formative yearsânone whatsoever in factâand even well into adulthood he was not here in Australia. But he instantly picked up themes in this country concerned with human rights, racism, Aboriginal affairs and reconciliation with a level of intensity that belied his recent immigrant status. They were clearly convictions profoundly within him, based on the experiences he had had in his childhood, his experiences perhaps in the services and in service overseas. </para><para>Looking through his speeches and his attitudes to life, he was a classic British Liberal, a party and a conviction which has for a century been wandering in the wilderness trying to find a political force on which to alight. That is not said with any mockery at all; that is a statement of fact, and it is one of the interesting features of politics within the Westminster system that that has been the case. In Britain, according to one of his obituary writers, he found that he could not join the Conservative Party, but he was able to commit himself to the Liberal Party in Australia when he came here. Then he took what was, I think, an approach to politics profoundly also within the British traditionâideological and principledâa reflection of a view that, as you go through life in the party process, and there are 650 members of parliament, you may not necessarily get there and that, nevertheless, you have an obligation to your constituents to make a mark in the political process and make some changes. </para><para>In this place, the speech which will mark him in the minds of many of this generation of parliamentarians was his speech on a speech made earlier by the then member for Oxley on the subject of race and related matters. His concluding paragraph is an interesting one. He stated:</para><quote><para>The member for Oxley talked about a whole range of other things. She talked about the Child Support Agency, she talked about the economy, she talked about national serviceâI might add that the green corps is a form of national serviceâbut it seemed to me that the speech was riddled with no research, no facts, very little logic, nothing constructive, generalisations and simplistic solutions that have been proven in the past not to work. It might strike a chord with some, but it seems to me that she does neither the House, her electorate nor this country any service by making those comments. I oppose her views. I will challenge them and I will rebut them at every opportunity because I believe that is one of the reasons why my electorate has sent me here.</para></quote><para>That paragraph had been preceded by a forensic analysis of a series of bogus claims. He warned at the time against the pinpricks of racism that were occurring in the schoolyards and workplaces because of the debate then developing. `It is the daily action,' he said, `that causes damage and that causes the hurt.' </para><para>As the Prime Minister said, he had a detailed, deep interest in Aboriginal affairs and immigration matters. That was reflected in his appointments, one of those appointments being to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He told the House in 1994:</para><quote><para>I believe that I perceive the start of a sea change in attitude in this country. Irrespective of whether one agrees with some of the details of the issues, public awareness about the plight of indigenous people and the disadvantaged is much greater. There is a desire to see those matters addressed and to bring about reconciliation.</para></quote><para>In the time he served on the council, since then, and of course prior to his service, there can be no doubt whatever that, whether or not we have achieved reconciliation in this countryâand we have not in fact achieved it yet, although I firmly believe we willâhe had the most profound conviction that we were on the right course to achieve that end. In the native title debate in this place he said that he hoped that his colleagues would treat Mabo as a good opportunity for this country, once and for all, to face up to issues which have been bedevilling it for generations.</para><para>There have been a number of debates in this place in the time that I have been opposition leader related to legislation or changes to the native title legislation dealing with issues that arose out of the Wik judgment and the question of whether or not it is appropriate for the parliament to issue an apology on questions of the Aboriginal stolen generation. There has been discussion in this place on mandatory sentencing. On all occasions the late member pushed his views with strength and conviction, and he pushed them in public.</para><para>As befits the fact that he was also a passionate campaigner against human rights abuses, he was Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and it was clear to all our members that he relished his role in that regard. He raised the whole plethora of human rights issues that have interested us in this region. I understand too that he served as Chairman of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group. He said in December 1996:</para><quote><para>The pursuit of human rights is a matter of great importance for Australians. It is one of our defining characteristics, expressed colloquially as the `fair go' philosophy ... All nations, including our own, have weaknesses that must be addressed. Just as the values underpinning human rights are universal, so the human weaknessesâcruelty, tyranny, racial intolerance and warâare universal. For us, the flaws in our record are in the treatment of Aboriginal people, the homelessness amongst youth, the treatment of the mentally ill, violence against women and violence against children ... </para></quote><para>He is a man that his family can be enormously proud of. He is a man that this chamber can be proud of.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>26672</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in support of the condolence motion before the House. Much has been said by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and I see no point in restating it, except to acknowledge the accuracy and generosity of the views that they have expressed in relation to Peter Nugent, who has been so sadly lost to us. He was, as has been said, passionate about foreign policy and social issues involving the treatment of minority groups and the disadvantaged.</para></talk.start><para>I first became aware of this when as a young backbencherâI came in on a by-election in 1989 and he came in in 1990âI served with him on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, at that point chaired by the member for Denison, as I recall. We went out to the north-west of New South Wales on a field trip and spent some time at Walgett and then Moree looking at a number of issues. I have to say that I did not always agree with the views of the committee, or even indeed of the member for Aston, but I certainly acknowledge that they were, on his part, very strongly held, passionately held and held with integrity. I respected him greatly for that. I think it is fair to say that, as I look back on what he learnt on that trip and the feelings that he expressed to me about it at the time, he would be in some ways delighted to see what has happened in the intervening years, particularly with such programs as the Aboriginal Employment Strategy at Moree, but he would equally have been challenged by the extent of the task that remains.</para><para>He was, as has been so eloquently said by the two previous speakers, a man of open and frank nature who never backed away from his views. He certainly served on a number of parliamentary committees apart from the one that I have just touched on, including the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and he was chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee from 1996 and the chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority since 1998. As again has been touched on, he was someone who was very interested in human rights internationally, and his work as chairman of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group since 1996 reflected that. He was, as has also been noted, a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1991.</para><para>He had a very great interest in foreign affairs, in particular in China. Ironically, I had been intending to visit his electorate and some surrounding electorates to look at a certain road proposal for Scoresby just prior to his death, but he in fact asked me to postpone it because of his intended visit to China. Ever seeking to oblige my Liberal colleagues, I did so; and, tragically, that particular visit was never possible and never will be, in terms of the original proposal for looking at the roadâwhich we have now, of course, as the Prime Minister announced recently, agreed to fund and which will make a very great difference to people who live in that part of the world, whom the member for Aston continued to champion with loud and strong support. On behalf of my family and of the party that I have the privilege of leading, I do seek to express my sympathy to his familyâmembers of which are here with us todayâto his colleagues, to his staff and to his many friends in this and other lands; and I support the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>26672</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by my leader. The three people who have already spoken have put the facts on the record and have spoken well and strongly of the range and strength of Peter Nugent's role in this parliament, both as a local member and as an ardent advocate of issues of profound importance to him and to the nation. I want to speak principally in my capacity as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, because it is in that way that I had my most recent and most affecting conversations with Peter Nugentâalthough I had of course known him for a long time before that, and our paths had crossed on a number of occasions socially around this building and on a number of issues on which we had spoken. </para></talk.start><para>Before I do that, I want to speak about a couple of circumstances in which Peter's role in the parliament came, in a very human way, to be brought to my attention within the last monthâin particular, about a function I attended here in my own constituency shortly after his death, and which a large number of young people who are working for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as trainees attended, but not in that capacity; it was a function of an entirely different character, but they were there. One of them worked in the human rights section of the department and spoke quite passionately of the representations they had received from Peter Nugent about a whole range of human rights issues. I said to him that of course I was aware of that, because Peter had been chairman of the Amnesty group, of which I was a member, and there was a longstanding tradition that foreign affairs ministers of all political persuasions had taken those representations from the parliamentary group seriously and had given them high priority. The officer said yes, that was true, but that he wanted to make it clear to me that a large number of the representations were made by Peter in his own capacity, beyond those which he had made officially. In a sense, that had made a bigger impact on the individual because there are the official duties that we performâstill with, in the case of Amnesty and many other issues, passion and commitmentâbut then there are the extra things you do because they are important to you as an individual. That clearly had moved this young officer, but it had a big impact on me too; and I think it speaks very highly of Peter.</para><para>The other thing I want to refer to is a conversation I had a little further ago than that, shortly after I became the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I will not go into the detail, because I am not sure that it is appropriate to disclose that sort of conversation, but I was very encouraged by the comments he made to me about his experiences, however brief, as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and about his longstanding previous and subsequent interest in those issues. He gave me good advice and much encouragement, and I greatly appreciated it. It was just one of those casual conversations you can have in the parliament when you meet people not in any prearranged way but with an opportunity to have a brief private conversation about issues of shared concern. I was impressed and gratified that he took the opportunity to do that and I thought it reinforced in a private, undemonstrative way, the points that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party have made about the public record.</para><para>I would like mainly to direct my remarks to the advocacy that Peter Nugent made on behalf of indigenous Australians on issues that affected them. A large number of both leaders and other people in indigenous communities have spoken to me of this in the last month. It could be, of course, a very controversial policy areaâit has been over the years, in the years since 1990 in particular, in that period in which Peter Nugent has been in the parliamentâand he took a brave role within that controversial area. I do not want to pursue the partisan elements of it todayâthat would not be appropriateâbut I want to indicate some of the attitudes that were articulated in this place by the member for Aston, as he then was, and to reinforce the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition about some of those attitudes.</para><para>It was for just over 12 months that Peter Nugent was the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, from April 1993 to May 1994, but he made a very significant impact for someone who held that position for such a short time and he was outspoken in his support for many aspects of the Mabo decision. I will not go into those details, because the Leader of the Opposition has done that. I think there was a significant contribution for him to make had he stayed on the front bench; but it is to his credit that, having gone to the back bench, he continued to make that contribution.</para><para>I want to reinforce the comments that the leader made about the brave speech which the member for Aston made as the first personânot only the first person on the coalition side but the first person on any side of the parliamentâto speak in response to the then member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, and he saidâand he was right: </para><quote><para>I think it is important that somebody in this place is seen to be prepared to stand up and point out what I believe is the error of many of her statements.</para></quote><para>Many people followed, but he was the first and he deserves credit for that.</para><para>I also want to give credit to a speech he made in parliament on 18 March 1997 in speaking on Sir Ronald Wilson and on the report on the stolen generation. He expressed views which many on this side of the Houseâand certainly Iâshared. He said:</para><quote><para>I would have to say that Sir Ronald Wilson has been one of the outstanding Australians of our generation ...</para></quote><para>I think that is right. He went on to say a large amount more about him. In particular, I want to refer to what he said about the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report. He said:</para><quote><para>... his report in that area is before the government and we look forward to a positive response from the government ...</para></quote><para>He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>I think that HREOC report is a very important report because, if you do not understand the significance of the impact on many indigenous people of having been taken away from their parents or having had their children taken away from them, then you do not understand the root cause of many of the problems of disadvantage today. If you do not understand the causes, then you cannot fix the problems that are manifest today. So I think that is a very important report.</para></quote><para>He was, once again, one of the first in this parliamentâon this occasion not the first, but one of the firstâto make those connections, to speak powerfully in support of that matter and to participate actively in the committee report into that Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report which came before the parliament and which led to that debate.</para><para>He also spoke eloquently and effectively in 1998 on the Native Title Amendment Bill and said some things which I think history will judge as prescient. I will not quote them today; it would lead us into some controversies that would be better addressed on another occasion. He also won my respect and the respect of many on this side for his principled stand on the issue of mandatory sentencing in more recent times. Those things are to his credit.</para><para>We all stand with our party on many occasions and do things that are difficult and go back to our electorates and argue for them. It is doubly hard when you do things that are difficult and you are a little more isolated, and I think that is a matter for which he deserves our recognition and support. I think we all share the view that the parliament was very well served by Peter Nugent. I outlined a number of things on which I agreed with him; I certainly disagreed with him about a number of other things, but I and many of my colleagues respected his stands, particularly on the issue of race. I join with the other speakers in extending my sympathies to his family.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>26674</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would also like to join other members in supporting the Prime Minister's motion and to say how deeply shocked and saddened I was to learn of Peter Nugent's death on 24 April. He was to many of us a very fine colleague and a friend. He was somebody who, throughout his time as a member of parliamentâwhich is the only period of his life that I knew himâalways showed something you look for in public life, and that is courage. There were times when he did not agree with people in his party. As honourable members may know, I was briefly the leader of the Liberal Party, and there were times when he did not agree with me, and there were times when he did not agree with my august and most successful successor.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, he was always prepared to stick by his position. You do not find a lot of that in politics. You find people who sometimes feel that their own careers may be better advanced by taking a weaker line, but he did not do that. He did have the courage of his convictions, and I think it has to be said that anybody here would have to admire that, and I certainly admired him for that. Like the Prime Minister, I had my differences with Peter during those tumultuous years of opposition, but we really came very much together after the 1996 election when he became the chair of the government foreign affairs and trade backbench committee and I became the foreign minister. Throughout all that timeâthrough those five yearsâwe really were able to work very closely together. You always knew where he was coming from; he had a very clear set of principles. </para><para>I think he was very much driven by his own experiences in the Royal Air Force, serving as he did in South-East Asia during a difficult timeâin particular, in what was then called Malaya. He applied principles to international relations of what you might call kindness, and he applied them with equal value to all individuals regardless of their race or their creed or, to a very large extent, their nationality. It was this sort of conviction to kindness and to the rights, the decency and the dignity of the individual that he applied to his whole approach to international relations. Others have said that he took a very strong stance on human rights. As foreign minister I get a strong sense of who is seriously interestedâas distinct from in party political termsâin human rights issues, and I would say that, of all of the members of this parliament, there was nobody who showed a greater genuine interest and a greater genuine passion for human rights at the international level than Peter Nugent did. He really did have a tremendous conviction for human rights. Over the last five years we very seldom disagreed on the sorts of approaches that Australia should take on those issues. He understood what the limitations were, he understood very well what our constraints were, but, at the same time, he did not ever want us to walk away from our principles.</para><para>He, as the chair of the government backbench committee on foreign affairs and trade, would have me hauled before that committee every month or so. He would begin every meeting in a very matter-of-fact way, saying, `All right, what have you got to tell us today?' trying to force me to present some strong case for what I was doingâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name></talker><para>âAnd quite rightly.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>âAnd quite rightly so, yes. He was always the boss and he made me answer the questionsâand that was appropriate. It has, in a sense, been the toughest forum for me in the context of the parliament because it is private and there are very genuine and quite effective questionsâusually well researched and well thought through. But we did not really have great points of disagreement in our respective capacities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>He served in the position of chair during some very difficult periods for Australia. He served in that position through the great upheavals of 1999 over East Timor and he was always very interested, knowledgeable and sensitive to the vast issues that Australia had to wrestle with at that time. He was very committed to a lot of the work we had been doing on disarmament issues. Indeed, by coincidence, today I have just met with the National Consultative Committee on Peace and Disarmament, which is a body set up many years ago, I think in 1985, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the department to consult with various NGOsâthe opposition is on itâand others on issues of peace and disarmament. He was the government representative on that committee from July 1999. He had a great interest in the work we did on bringing the comprehensive test ban treaty into existence, and he was a strong supporter of the Ottawa landmines ban treaty and a number of other initiatives of that type.</para><para>It is also important to understand that his interest in international affairs was a sophisticated and very genuine interest. He was not one of those people who was just interested in a bit of tourist travel; he had a real intellectual interest in international relations, be they defence issues, trade issues or broader foreign policy issues. His understanding of Australia's place in the region and Australia's place in the world was a very profound and sophisticated one. </para><para>Finally, others have said a little about his opposition to the sorts of things that have been articulated by people like Pauline Hanson. He was certainly somebody who always opposed extremism. He was always somebody who took a moderate and balanced view of issuesâeven if one would sometimes agree with him and sometimes not. </para><para>I would like to end where I began: the thing about Peter Nugent that always struck me as a friend and a colleague is that he had an awful lot of courage and conviction. At a time of great stress, great strain and great sorrow, his family can take comfort from the fact that here was a man who really did make a difference, who actually came to the national parliament of Australia and stood up for something, fought for it and cared about it. He was a man who made a difference. I extend my sympathy and condolences to Carol and to Peter's family and thank him for all he did for Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>26676</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPeter came into the parliament on the anniversary of my election on a second occasion. It was at the time I was appointed to chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, my first seriously responsible position in the service of this House, and Peter came to serve on that committee. We of course travelled extensively throughout Australiaâand the now Deputy Prime Minister has recalled a time when we arrived in his electorateâthrough New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and together we learned much about the difficulties facing those of an indigenous background in this country. Some of the passion that has been reflected in the  discussions I am sure emerged through the exposure we both received through that period of time.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, his service on that committee was cut short, because it was well recognised then that his passion, energy and talent should be recognised through higher service. He was appointed to the front bench of the Hewson shadow ministry as the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and, in that role, he took the experience he had acquired as a member of that standing committee on which we had both served and began to play a very significant part in carving out a strong voice on behalf of the opposition on indigenous affairs. It is not an easy role for any parliamentarian and not always a comfortable one for us in government. We hear of the attentions that have attended his relationship and his courage as a member of the governing party now in office, but at that time he was a very effective critic of some of the conduct and practices of the Labor Party then in office.</para><para>In other circumstances, had fortune favoured John Hewson in the election which was lost in 1993, he would have served honourably and well at a senior level in a Hewson cabinet. The Prime Minister has adverted to the factâand of course, this being a condolence motion, this is not a point to carp on in relation to differences but it is certainly trueâthat there are streams of opinion and differences in the Liberal tradition and there is no doubt that, within that larger stream of liberalism that reflects more the British Liberal tradition and, of course, is marked by previous leaders of the Liberal Party such as John Hewson on the social conditions side and former prime ministers like Menzies, there would have been an honoured, significant and long lasting role on the front bench in government as well as in opposition. His tragedy was that that election was lost and the circumstances which would have permitted his return to high office never emerged. But, of course, he accepted that with extraordinary dignity.</para><para>In a system that is being increasingly characterised by a presidential focus on leaders, Peter represented a longer traditionâthe self-respect that comes from being a member of a parliamentâand that honoured role is a role which increasingly our media fail to focus upon and we in this House fail to honour sufficiently. I believe that, if one thing stands out as a mark of Peter Nugent's leadership, it is the regard he had for himself and the opinions he held as a member elected as a representative of his constituency. I think too that, in an age when cynicism about the political process is increasing, we all ought to cherish those amongst us who are prepared to stand on positions that they hold dear to their conscience and suffer occasionally as a consequence setbacks in this political process. There is no doubt that Peter was such a person. He was a person, though, who was able in that regard to conduct himself always with good spirits and a sense of optimism that a better future was obtainable because of the contribution he might make as a parliamentarian. </para><para>Few have mentioned his capacity for friendship. He and I were entrants into a political process in which we had to rub along closely together and we then worked together in various organisations such as the parliamentary Amnesty group. More recently, through his service as chair of the joint committee looking after the National Crime Authority, we developed more than just the comradeship that happens in this place where you bump into each other occasionally; we actually did discuss our personal circumstances from time to time. Each of us has gone through difficult personal circumstances from time to time and it is good to know that, in this extremely competitive and combative environment, the basic decent goodness that shows in a person can be reflected in that capacity to have a dialogue across the chamber. So in Peter's loss I feel not only a deep sense of personal separation from somebody who I thought was a fighter for causes which ought to have been rather more successful but also a sense of personal loss of somebody whom I looked to as an example for the community of what being a member of parliament truly represents.</para><para>That spark of his never went out. We have focused on his contribution to and courage in relation to the Hanson debate, and I think that there is no reason not to focus on that because more than a few on all sides of politics started to bend in the wind as a rather craven response to what seemed to be a hurricane of popular opinion at that time. Peter Nugent never bent and he demanded of us on the opposition side a courage which we also had to display and he demanded of his own side a courage which eventually was also displayed. Without him the consequences of that very difficult period might have been somewhat different. He never swayed from those commitments to public life.</para><para>In a less spectacular role, as chair of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, he bluntly tabled reports quite aggressively asserting this parliament's rights. For example, in one of the last reports he tabled he made the point that, if the minister were not going to give greater capacity to the committee to examine the workings of the National Crime Authority and to demand accountability, you might as well wind it up. The Labor Party, in a sense very mindful of this kind of bipartisanship, has taken some measures in this parliament to try to increase accountability in that area.</para><para>I think that those of us in the parliamentary process have to honour such people. They exist on both sides of parliament. For example, on occasions I have made remarks regarding some of the difficulties that have been occasioned by the work of Senator Barney Cooney in relation to the same commitment to human rights that Peter Nugent showed on his side, but this parliament is far better for such people than were they not to have been in this House. These are the people who always hold us to the tests that we assert in public but that they actually hold to be benchmarks of whether or not a piece of conduct is honourable and worthy of support. Those kinds of measuring sticks that do not bend in the gales of public opinion, that hold to their opinions notwithstanding the popularity or otherwise of them, that demand to speak up for those who are least well off in our society and for those who are less advantagedâthose who stand up in all those circumstancesâare the moral exemplars that will prevent this parliament from being held in low regard. It is also worth while to know, notwithstanding an environment in which we are having this increasing focus on the leaderships of parties and a gradual transition to the way in which politics is reported as a quasi-presidential system, that there is still space in this parliament and in the hearts of parliamentarians to honour such a man. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>26678</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to be associated with this condolence motion not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my wife Heather and we very much extend our condolences to Carol and members of the Nugent family. I do so, in a sense, as a kindred spirit in relation to the issues that Peter Nugent held dear and that have been areas in which, in my own parliamentary career, I have been very much involved. In the area of reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, I serve as the minister but I served at earlier points in time on the same parliamentary committees which have been mentioned here today as he did.</para></talk.start><para>He had an involvement with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and was actively involved in that work over a long period of time. Equally so, he had an interest in immigration and the outcome of the immigration programâthe way in which we settle people here. But, more importantly, he had an interest in the more important part of immigrationâthat is, the refugee and humanitarian programâand, equally, an interest which is shared by a number of members of the parliament at the moment in relation to those who come to Australia to make asylum claims. And, of course, he was vitally interested in the issue in the context of how to respond humanely but nevertheless maintain a rigour in relation to the process.</para><para>He was constructive in contributing in each of these areas, and I am able to say as minister and as one who would regard himself in the parliament as being a kindred spirit that I was grateful for his counsel and his advice as a friend. More particularly, given the longstanding association I have had with Amnesty International, I was very grateful, having been honoured by the Prime Minister and invited to serve in his ministry and therefore unable to continue to hold senior office in the parliamentary Amnesty group, when Peter Nugent expressed a willingness to be the chairman of the group. The issues in which we can all be judged in this place can be best seen when we come to them as volunteers, because for us they are a passion. In the area of human rights, his commitment could be seen by the fact that he was willing to lead in that area and to lead willingly and vocally. </para><para>I was impressed also by his involvement in the friendship group with China, because often there is a contest between the human rights issues which we want to address and the broader importance of our relationship as nation-states. Peter was able to come to those issues with a maturity that recognised not only the issue of principle but also the issue of how to best achieve for your nation reasonable outcomes in these matters. Many people come into the parliament hoping to serve as Treasurer and they join the Public Accounts and Audit Committee, they come into the parliament hoping to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and they join the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but Peter was one of those who came into the parliament to serve in those areas where we are interested in the human dimension, and the parliament would be much poorer if there were not people like Peter Nugent in it.</para><para>Heather and I saw Peter only two weeks or so before his tragic death. He came with the member for Cook, Bruce Baird, and the member for Throsby, Colin Hollis, to meet with the intergovernmental group of officials that was visiting Australia to talk about, particularly, immigration and protection issues. Given the work of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which he chaired, he had an interest in engaging in dialogue with the leadership of other countries and with the immigration officials who were here. He was able to engage with them to get a better understanding of the way in which they were dealing with those issues which we are dealing with hereâissues that his committee is involved in. </para><para>I am pleased to be a member of a Liberal Party that was big enough to accommodate Peter Nugent. Peter Nugent was outspoken on these questions; he had a passion in relation to them and he ensured that we remain very much a party that has a human dimension to it and a capacity to deal with these issues. I am grateful to number Peter Nugent as a personal friend that I have had in the parliament. I will miss him greatly.

It is a particularly sad occasion to be here once again on a condolence motion for a colleague with whom I spent a good deal of time over the last eight years that I have been here. Peter was the member for Aston, and my current seat of Bruce runs alongside Aston. So I knew Peter not only from his time here but from his time in the local area. I have to say on that front that he was a tough campaigner and was very active in local community groups. If you went to functions in the area, he and Carol were always there. He was very well respected. In this business, when you share your local area with colleagues from other parties, quite often people will say things about those who are from the other partyâand no doubt things are said about you as wellâbut the fact is that I have never heard anyone say a bad word about Peter in terms of his operation in the local area. </para></talk.start><para>As the Prime Minister mentioned before, the Liberal Party won some nine seats in Victoria in 1990âI know I was put out of work by one of themâand, of those nine members that were elected in those nine seats at that time, only three remain in the parliament. In fact, one of themâthe member for McEwenâactually went out and came back. The Chief Government Whip, as I understand it, is retiring at the next election, which will leave Bob Charles as the only continuing member of those nine, and I think he is in trouble!</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">â</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name></talker><para>âThe nine you wonâyou won nine seats at that time.

The average is about eight years for anybody, so those of us who have been in marginal seats and have lasted beyond four or five years can say a few Hail Marys and thank the Lord for that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On a policy front a lot has been said about Peter. I will not go through all of that again, other than to say that he believed in a fair goâhe had a real concern for the disadvantaged in our society and a real concern about issues relating to foreign affairs and human rights. Much has been said about his involvement there. He was very thoughtful in his contributions and very intelligent in what he said. When he spoke on those issues, even if you did not agree with himâand I have got to say that I often didâyou were always compelled by his arguments, his intellect and his commitment.</para><para>As parliamentarians, all of us come to this place with expectations, hopes and dreams, and quite often they do not quite work out that way. It is true to say that in politics timing is everything; it is also true to say that in the context of this place timing was pretty cruel to Peter with respect to what he may have been, given other circumstances taking place. But as a parliamentarian he could be very proud. As the old saying goes, it is one thing to stand up and be counted and it is another thing to keep standing after the counting has finished, and he always kept standing for the issues that he saw as important. He was not prepared to be phased out or bought off in any context around thatâhe stuck to his views. That is something he could be very proud of and that those who were close to him can be very proud of.</para><para>He was, I guess, a classic parliamentarian in the Westminster tradition. We often talk about the Westminster tradition in this place, but I think, as we all realise when we look at the classic operation of a Westminster system, ours is not quite there. But I think Peter, in his operation as a member of parliament, was very much there. He had that conviction and that preparedness to stand up on issues he saw as important. He believed and he had a go; he had integrity and he was well respected. I was at his funeral the other week and was not surprised but still impressed by the size of the crowd. It showed quite a lot about the fact that this was a man who was taken from us before he should have been and who certainly had the respect of his peers and the community. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>26680</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to speak on this condolence motion today, particularly because duty called and I was not able to join Carol, whom I acknowledge today, and the Nugent family at Peter Nugent's funeral, where I would very much have liked to have been. Peter's life, as we have heard, was cut short. It is like having a member of the family die when one of us, a sitting member, passes away in such circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>We have already heard how Peter was born on 1 April 1938 in the UK and how he left school at 15 to serve in the British Royal Air Force in the UK, Singapore and Cyprus, a career which would span 24 years. In 1977 Peter retired from the Air Force as a squadron leader and migrated to Australia that same year. In 1980 he showed very good choice in joining the Liberal Party, and in 1983 he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party's candidate in the federal seat of La Trobe in Victoria, a seat which was of course then won by the Labor Party and eventually won by his friend and colleagueâwho I know will be backâBob Charles. But Peter Nugent did not give up, and in 1990, as we have already heard, he was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Aston. He successfully defended Astonâalways a marginal seatâin 1993, 1996 and 1998. After the last election he held that seat by a margin of 4.2 per cent, and I noted that Michael Harvey, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun Herald </inline>last month, said:</para><quote><para>He forged a reputation as a strong campaigner whose hard work defined the essence of a good member.</para></quote><para>You have also heard today what a hardworking and committed member of parliament Peter Nugent was, demonstrated by his record of participation in parliamentary committee work, policy development and all that goes into the debates that we have in this place. He was passionate about helping the indigenous people of Australia. He was a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1991 to 1997, and from April 1993 to May 1994 served as the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. Peter was a vocal opponent of mandatory sentencing and was one of us who argued against the race debate heralded by the politics of Pauline Hanson and One Nation, saying it caused `damage and hurt'. Peter was also a strong advocate of a national apology to the indigenous people. However, it should be noted that, despite his well-known views in this area, he was critical of Peter Garrett and his group, who wore `sorry' outfits during their performance at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, accusing them of introducing domestic politics into the Olympics.</para><para>I would particularly like to associate my remarks with those already made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, because Peter had a strong interest in these areas. He has been described by the foreign minister as decent, kind, principled and courageous, and I certainly agree with all those descriptions. From 1996 Peter was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and chaired the Human Rights Subcommittee. At that time he also took over from Minister Ruddock as the chair of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International. This is where I really got to know Peter Nugent, because I too was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Amnesty International at that time. He and I were the only two Liberals on the Human Rights Subcommittee, which I left when I became a parliamentary secretary in mid-1997. That is certainly where I got to know Peter Nugent very well and came to admire him greatly. </para><para>The committee system that works across the parliament is very good for giving people an opportunity to work hard in areas where they have great interest, and Peter certainly did that. It was, of course, with the foreign affairs committee that Peter visited East Timor in December 1999 and again this year. After his first visit he told the parliament:</para><quote><para>We met with the United Nations human rights team, who were conducting an investigation of abuses of human rights. There is no question that there have been human rights abuses on a huge scale. We must support the United Nations in its investigations, and also Indonesia in its investigations, and pursue those who are responsible for those abuses.</para></quote><para>In his maiden speech, back in 1990, Peter talked about the environment. He said:</para><quote><para>When we talk about the environment, let me make it quite clear that the environment is not the prerogative of extremists. It is the concern of middle Australia. The environment needs to be addressed in the context of action that is complementary to other activity, a necessity if this country is to survive. We have to address the real environmental problems and not just the symptoms. The vast bulk of our community, of course, most certainly rates the environment as a key issue. However, the people rank it below the economy by a significant factor. This is because most of them have the commonsense to understand that if we are broke we do not have the wherewithal to address the environmental issues properly. The costs of some environmental policies that have been suggested are prohibitive.</para></quote><para>Apart from his well known passion for indigenous, human rights and justice issues, Peter was also interested in other issues, such as technology and taxation. I am interested to learn, for instance, that he argued against the superannuation surcharge. Prior to entering parliament, Peter worked in marketing and sales in a computing and information technology company. In his maiden speech he spoke of Australia's need to embrace technology in order to prosper. Interestingly, in the late 1970s, before coming to this place, Peter worked for a company called International Computer Ltd and moved to Canberra to install the first computerised Hansard system in the Old Parliament House.</para><para>I express my great sympathy to Carol and to the extended Nugent family. While I know that you will have been grieving and miss him greatly, I am sure that you will be comforted by such headlines as `Liberals lose decent and honourable man' and `Nugent an MP of âconscience and courageâ'.

I can attest to the fact that he was well organised, he was articulate on the issues and he was fearless in the way that he put his point of view.</para><para>If the family will forgive me on this occasion, I will use some Labor Party parlance in talking about Peter, because for many of us in this place and for the community he was the light on the hill, a voice on particular issues that reminded us constantly of our obligation to the most decent and enduring values that bind us together in this place and as a society. Peter was never one to suffer fools lightly. That was my experience of Peter, and that was never more evident than in the contribution that he made in speeches to this place, especially the one in response to the former member for Oxley.</para><para>Some members occupy a very special place in the parliamentary scheme of things because they set the standard and the benchmark for us all. Peter was one such person, because of the views that he expressed on indigenous issues and on the issue of human rights. Although I did not know him intimately and closely, I knew Peter as a professional colleague, and what came through to me was his enduring decency, his courage and his care and compassion for other human beings.</para><para>This is a time of sadness for the Nugent family. But, as I have said on condolence motions before in this place in speaking about our fellow members who have passed away in whatever circumstance, as sure as night turns to day and day turns to night, the grief and sadness that the Nugent family are feeling at this point in time will be replaced by the warmest of memories of a very decent man.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>26682</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI came into this parliament with Peter Nugent in 1990âwe were part of the class of 1990. It is fair to say that Peter and I formed a little club of two, being somewhat on the left of some of the rest of our colleagues, so I got to know Peter very well. We did a lot of things together. We joined the parliamentary Amnesty group together. I remember that at one stage we went together to an environment conference in Perth and we were so proud that we were the only two people there from the whole parliament, including the Labor Party. We could not get the feeling out that we were greener than they were, but we felt we were holding the flag up for the Liberal side.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say to Carol that in one way Peter's death was typical of him: it was contained, there was nothing excessive about itâone minute he was with us, the next minute he was not. But in another way it was not like Peter, because Peter was a great person for planning and detail, and I am sure this is not how he had planned it, otherwise he would have left us all detailed instructions of what we were to say today and what we were to do!</para><para>People here today have talked a lot about Peter's commitments to human rights and to indigenous affairs. We all know how true that is. But I would not like us to feel that Peter was a saint. He was one of us and, I think Carol might agree, far from sainthood. At the funeral it was referred to that Peter was a patriarch, that he liked to come to the family and sit with his family around him, giving good advice. But, Carol, that was not only in his family; Peter was inclined to do that to his colleagues as well. Far be it from me to accuse Peter of any sexismâhe certainly was not sexistâbut I remember very clearly in our first years here when Peter, sitting next to me, said, `Chris, when I'm a minister I think I will ask you to work for me.' Yes, Peter! There was the assumption of a bit of the English patriarch and that I would have been a good, loyal female servant to Peter. I think that, between Carol and me, we disabused him of this attitude. </para><para>I knew Peter as a next-door neighbour: we had rooms next to each other from 1990 to 1993 and again from 1988 till the beginning of this year. There were numerous occasions when I borrowed milk, cookies and bread and butter from Peterâand I forgot the bowls and corkscrewsâbut I cannot recall an occasion when he borrowed anything from me. He did not have to, he was just so well prepared. But he did give very nice wine and cheese and chocolate parties. He used to enjoy very much sitting there with his glass of red eating the chocolates. All of us who went to those parties will miss him.</para><para>Again, he was not a saint. I can remember Peter making very acerbic remarks about individuals in the Labor Party and what he thought of some of their stands. To be fair, I can also remember some very acerbic comments about his own colleagues, including, I might say, some of the ministers. But that will now disappear into history.</para><para>It was mentioned that Peter was born in England and came here at a later time in his life as a British citizen. It suddenly struck me then that I had never thought of Peter as a Brit, as a Pom; that just did not come over, despite his behaviour and the way he lookedâhe had the look of the Royal Air Force about him. I thought of him much more as a very idiosyncratic Australian. He was very proud of his country, he was so proud to be a member of parliament, and he proved himself here.</para><para>In closing, I would like to say to you, Carol, to your family, to Deirdre, who I also knew well from the time that she worked with Peter, that you have my deep sympathy. I know that you are missing a very young husband who had many years ahead of him and a very young father, as are the rest of the family. He was an honourable man, a good friend, a proud Australian and an exemplary parliamentarian.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>26683</page.no><name role="metadata">Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr THEOPHANOUS</name><name.id>QJ4</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was very moved to attend the funeral of Peter Nugent. It was a very emotional occasion but it did him great honour, from all the people who attended and also the expressions of grief and the things that were said about him, especially those things said about him by his children. We have talked a lot about his parliamentary life, but I was moved to hear so much about his commitment to his family and the way he spent so much time with his family and had such dedication for them. Indeed, I could not imagine how he managed all that and the massive parliamentary load that he took on in the human rights area. Carol has been mentioned. She was a friend of me and my wife, Kathryn, and so was Peter. He showed that the many dimensions of his interest in world affairs were not only of this period when he used to engage Kathryn, who is an archaeologist, in discussions about her work and the things that happened in the ancient world.</para></talk.start><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Peter had an intellectual interest in foreign affairs, and that is correct. His interest in human rights was not simply fighting on a narrow agenda. It was an interest in human rights, but also looking at how we can organise the world so that there could be a better respect for human rights. In other words, he tried to have an international vision of a world in which human rights could be respected, notwithstanding the diversity of the world and the current problems of globalisation.</para><para>I discussed this matter with him, in fact, on a number of occasions because he wanted on each occasion to try to ensure that human rights could be achieved in a concrete way. This was exemplified in relation to China: he had this apparently contradictory position of being chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group while at the same time insisting on human rights with respect to China. The reason he did that was that he believed that, in discourse and discussion with the authorities in China, some progress could be made on human rights. His vision in these areas needs to be commended.  </para><para>The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs mentioned his concern about refugee humanitarian issues and about asylum seekers. As is well known, I do not entirely agree with the minister on these matters, but Mr Nugent, the honourable member for Aston, did discuss these matters with the minister and me, and with many others, and did try to ensure that we moved along in a humanitarian way on these critical issues. The same is true for Aboriginal reconciliation, and much has been said about his work in that area.</para><para>Peter Nugent was an example of a member of parliament who had the courage of his convictions. What he also illustrated was the need for this parliament to allow more latitude and freedom for people to express such views without the party whip being too strong. It would be a very good thing if there were more people like Peter Nugent in the parliament who not only privately express views but are ready to stand up in this House and in public and pursue those views even if they may not at that time be the views of their own party, because there will come a time when they will be the views of their party. </para><para>I believe that Peter Nugent was an optimist. He believed in the evolution of human rights, not only here in Australia but throughout the world. He believed that it could be achieved. I hope that all members of the House will somehow contribute to that optimism and that we in Australia and in the Australian parliament can respect the memory of Peter Nugent by actually doing more to promote human rights not only here but also internationally. My fellow member, Independent Peter Andren, who is not here at the moment, also shares these views and wants to express his deep respect for the courageous and principled views of Peter Nugent. Finally, to Carol and her family, I say that they can be very proud of the life of Peter Nugent and what he has contributed to Australia and to the international human rights movement. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26684</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support this motion of condolence, and I do so on both my behalf and that of my partner Rosie. Let me say in the beginning that Peter Nugent and I were mates. Peter, Carol, Rosie and I became good friends. That is not an easy word to use in this place. I think we all know that it is very difficult to form friendships in this rather hostile environment. There is nothing about the parliament environment or the political environment that is `normal'. Most of us recognise that. We have colleagues, comrades and neighbours, and we come together in loose and tight coalitions of one form or another, but we make very few friendships. I was honoured to have Peter Nugent as a friend, and to call him a friend. We actually had much in common. Firstly, we were both immigrantsâwe were both new Australiansâand both proud of our adopted country. Despite misgivings in coming into this place in 1990, colleagues on both sides accepted both of us and many others who have come from other lands as Australians, as bringing to this place ideas from our constituency and as representing Australia, not some overseas interest. Peter was proud to be a new Australian. For a time, he and I went to citizenship ceremonies together and then we used to trade off for a whileâone at a timeâbut both of us very much looked forward to those occasions when we could talk to other new Australians about our experiences and about what a great country it is and how it has so welcomed people from all the lands on earth. It has become truly the great melting pot of the world.</para></talk.start><para>Both of us stood for election in La Trobe, unsuccessfullyâPeter in 1983 and I in 1987. We still seem to have made it here, but we both did stand for La Trobe unsuccessfully. We both won Labor seats in 1990âPeter in Aston and I in La Trobe. We instantly became part of that infamous class of 1990. That was a great bunch of people, may I tell you. That was big historic stuff. We won nine seats from Labor in Victoria in 1990, and the Treasurer and the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs also won seats as new members. We had senators as well, and Alex Somlyay from Queensland and others around the joint, but the class of 1990 was very close. We were. It was one of those institutions which, unfortunately, the member for Bruce has described as declining in numbers. I regret that. </para><para>Peter and I both had a strong belief in Liberalism, in the value of this great party, which the Prime Minister describes as being a broad church and which I would describe as being a melting pot of ideas, of conflicting interests and of resolution to drive towards the better human experience. Peter and I held adjoining electorates. He talked about Aston as his patch, and you did not want to violate Peter's patchâthat was his patch and he grew his constituents well, because they liked and respected him. You cannot ask a whole lot more than that out of this job and this place.</para><para>We were not always friends and we were not always close. In fact, from our election in 1990 until the election in 1996, Peter and I were competitors. People listening to this broadcast and reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may find that somewhat difficult to understand, since we both belonged to the same Liberal Party of Australia. Certainly my colleagues on the other side of the House well understand that because we all compete for a frontbench position. We all want to be on the treasury bench, we all want to be in the ministry, in the executive, and we are not all going to make it. In fact, none of the infamous class of 1990 made it. In 1996, after Peter and I realised that we were not going to be ministers, we gave up and became friendsâthat is a fact. In 1997, Rosie and I got to know Peter and Carol really well, and some of my colleagues on the other side as well, when Bruce Reid, the former member for Bendigo, led the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group on a two-week semi-official visit to China very shortly on the heels of the Prime Minister's visit with a number of formidable Australian business people. Peter was the secretary of that group. I say semi-official in that we were guests of the Chinese government for two weeks.</para><para>In 1999, I went back with Peter and Carolâa lot of us went againâand on this occasion Peter was chairman and I was secretary. There was one commonality about both of those experiences: that is, the Chinese treated us magnificently. We stayed in five-star hotels, we ate magnificently, they took us to see the treasures and beauties of China, including five days in Tibet, and we met many PRC officials including, twice, Zhu Rongji, the Premier of China, with whom we held long discussions and who is a great friend of Australia. Some have talked about a conflict of interest for Peter between human rights and a close friendship with China. It did not destroy his friendship with China or with the Chinese; it was very important to him and a very important part of his life. Those were great trips. Another commonality between the two trips was the fact that Carol was the one behind the scenes who did all the workâ that, absolutely, is a fact.</para><para>Peter was a champion of social justice. Others have talked about his expertise in this area. He believed in human rights and fought hard for them. He knew a lot about international affairs and used his expertise to good advantage in this place and when he was overseas. He and I walked together in the Melbourne march for reconciliation. I appreciated that opportunity. There were many things on which we did not see eye to eye. We were not exactly soul mates on some social policy issues, but that is hardly surprising. It did not stop us being friends or having the greatest respect for each other. He was a compassionate, loving and warm human being. Since his passing, I have not found anyone who has had an unkind word to say about Peter Nugent.</para><para>On the night of Peter's passing, Peter and Carol had a fundraising function in his electorate at Nelson's Restaurant in Knox. Rosie and I joined them to support Peter and also Hurtle Lupton, member for Knox, and his wife Dawn. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation was our guest speaker on that night. We spoke only briefly with Peter, unfortunately. He had returned just the night before from a trip to China resulting from a meeting we had had here with mayors from a number of provinces. I asked him how the trip went and he said, `Bob, we'll have to wait until we both have an hour to spare. I want to tell you about it, but it was terrible. It was really awful. I think it was because of the arrangementsâlittle sleep and poor organisation.' I also said, `How are you? You have just got back and here you are in the maelstrom again at a fundraising function immediately the next night.' He said, `To tell you the truth, I don't feel too well.' We parted at about 11 o'clock and at 2 o'clock in the morning, very suddenly, he left us and left his lovely wife, Carol. May I say to Carol and to her children, Nicholas, Victoria and Sarah, to Peter's children, Deirdre, Barry and Greg, to his sister, Janet, to his nephew, Christopher, to his staff, to all those who were dear and precious to him: you have our greatest sympathy. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>26686</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with the parliament and my colleagues in conveying to Carol and her family our deep regrets at Peter's death. The Prime Minister remarked that, when it is one of your contemporaries, one of your colleagues, it is so much more telling. Could I also add that, when you are overseas and distant from this country and do not have contact with colleagues and are unable to be in attendance at a funeral, that also adds to the degree of shock you suffer. I was overseas at that time, and I was indeed shocked and very saddened by Peter's demise. It hit me very strongly.</para></talk.start><para>My association with Peter began in 1990 and stemmed from activities involving the Timor question, when he and some other people on the opposite side such as the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Ballarat were able to be supportive of, let us say, those members of the parliament who, regardless of who dictated foreign policy in this country, were far more critical far earlier than others were of Australia's role in relation to Indonesia and of the continuing human rights abuses after the Timor occupation. I do not want to dwell on the things that have been often mentionedâPeter's activities around indigenous issues, mandatory sentencing and the race issueâbut I want to particularly take up the emphasis of the member for Corio, who said that Peter did not suffer fools easily. One thing that stood out for me about Peter's role on human rightsâand I think the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to some degree referred to thisâwas his very pragmatic, sensible approach. In pursuing a variety of issues, he was not one to be there for cheer chasing, for popularity, for sloganising. </para><para>Many members have referred to China. The essential issue there is the degree to which we have constructive engagement with a country about which we have some questions and some criticisms. People can often be critical of the government of the time when it says that it is in constructive engagement with Burma, for instance: is it genuinely in constructive engagement or is it part of a trade situation or whatever? But I do not think anybody could doubt that Peter Nugent's role in the Chinese Friendship Group and his engagement with China would have been accompanied very strongly by indications to that government that we did have a variety of criticisms and concerns about the way they handled human rights in that countryâwhether about Tibet, whether about workers' rights in factories, et cetera. </para><para>Similarly, in regard to immigration policy he would have strongly adhered to the requirement for humane treatment, but he would haveâand I know this for a factâabsolutely understood that it had to be viewed in the context of the need for a detention policy. He was a very realistic, pragmatic, sensible person in his campaign for human rights. Many members have referred to his activities in the Amnesty International group in which I am also proud to have played a long-term role. His resignation from the position of chairman of that group, which has been mentioned by no other member today, personified his very genuine and sensible emphasis on the human rights area. When he saw that organisation, to his mind, starting perhaps to be a bit dictatorial in its processes, a bit too inclined to prescribe and to actually say, `If you are not with us 100 per cent on every issue then you are not a campaigner,' he decided to resign as chairman. I am glad to say that the vast majority of people who were active on that committee supported him very strongly in that position.  </para><para>I do indeed join with the previous speakers in saluting Peter's broad interest in human rights around the world, his continual search for knowledge of other societies and his interest in their policies, and to his family again I convey my deep regrets.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>26687</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Financial Services and Regulation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI consider myself to be still a relatively new member of this place. On the very solemn occasions when you, Mr Speaker, ask us to rise for a minute's silence as a mark of respect for a previous member, in that minute of silence I often reflect on the spirits that must be breezing around in this chamber and on the fact that, even though I cannot identify the name and I do not know what they did in this place, their spirit continues to live on in this chamber. </para></talk.start><para>There is a very special place for Peter Nugent in this chamber because he was a champion of a very important cause. He was a champion of modern liberalism. He was a champion of small `l' liberalism which has pride of place in the broad church of the modern Liberal Party. In many ways the friendship between the member for La Trobe and the former member for Aston is a reflection of the broad church of the Liberal Party, the fact that a small `l' liberal such as Peter Nugent can take a leadership role within the moderates and hold deep philosophical views about the importance of liberalism, can work with a number of others to get the John Stuart Mill Society up and running, even though it has not met for a little while, and at the same time also embrace as very close friends people who may have at times differing views on a particular social policy.</para><para>One of the reasons why I say Peter's place is in this chamber for evermore is that I remember that, when I came in as a new member in 1996, like so many new members I struggled with what I was going to say in my maiden speech. After my speech, there were only two new members left to deliver their maiden speeches, the member for Oxley and the member for North Sydney. I decided to give a speech about modern liberalism. Immediately after my speech, the member for Oxley rose and made a speech which will have no pride of place, I believe, in this chamber. But it was her maiden speech and she believed in it. When your instincts say, `This is just not right,' and you really want to say something but as a new member you do not know how to say it, you turn to people with experience and you look to them for leadership. Peter Nugent was a person who showed immediate leadership by immediately coming into this chamber and saying, `I refute your position.' That gave me a lot of courage to stand up in this place to say what I think and to react to the instincts that we all hold dear.</para><para>There was a humorous side to Peter Nugent which sometimes can be lost in these motions. I well remember that in late 1997 the member for Grayndler, the member for Watsonâthe Chief Opposition Whipâthe member for Gippsland, Peter Nugent and I were invited to go on a trip to the Middle East. We decided that it was a good idea to take my father along, for two reasons: firstly, because he spoke Arabic and Hebrew and he would be able to understand whether the taxidrivers were ripping us off, and, secondly, because we did not want Peter to be the elder statesman of the tripâeven though we made him the leader, because we all agreed that Leo McLeay was certainly not diplomatic enough to balance the interests of Israel and Palestine and Egypt on the one trip, let alone the member for Grayndler.</para><para>I recall being in a van crossing the desert from Egypt to Israel after Peter had had some very unsettling Arab food the night before. We stopped in the middle of the desert so that he could exit the van: there were certainly no facilities around. It was quite a scene there in the desert with this fairly old van, with Peter Nugent standing outside and with complete red earth. There were a few jokes inside the van, as you can imagine, and we thought that we should share one with Peter. When Peter hopped into the van I said to him, `Don't worry, mate. Moses had a rough trip across the desert as well, from Egypt into Israel.' He did not see the humour in that, I must say, so we decided not to have any more jokes at his expense. But we also understood that he was a great source of advice in handling the very delicate situation involving discussions with the governments of Israel, Palestine and so on. </para><para>Finally, let me say that I think it is very important that we all take an opportunity to reflect on Peter's contribution not only to international affairs but particularly to the people of Aston. One night when I was with himâwe had a function in his office, organised by his teamâI had the opportunity to have a long chat to some of his key supporters in the Liberal Party, particularly his conference president. We all stated how important it was for Peter to be with us and to continue as the member for Aston for an extended period. When you meet a whole lot of people in the local area you always get a sense of how well liked a member is and how much they appreciate his contribution. There was a very strong admiration within the Liberal Party in Aston for what Peter was doing. There was a great determination to ensure that he was back at the next election because he was making a great contribution not only to the parliament on behalf of the people of Aston but also, and I think importantly, to all those people that care about human rights anywhere in the Australian community.</para><para>We then went to the function at the restaurant which the member for La Trobe talked about. Again, walking around the room I clearly sensed that Peter had a very loyal band of supporters who would do anything to support his re-election. Importantly, they were giving their support because they liked him. When we stepped outside the restaurant and it was just Peter and me I said to him, `Mate, we really want you. We really need you back.' He said, `Don't worry. Just fix up the problems with the financial planners.' I said, `I'll fix that, but we really want you back because you are very important to us.' He said, `Joe, it's not so much about me being in parliament: it's about how important it is to do the right thing.' Those are words that will live with me for evermore. Certainly, on each occasion when we rise to think about the spirits that are above us in this chamber in memory of another member who may have passed on, I will be thinking about Peter Nugent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>26688</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to associate myself with the remarks that have been made in respect of Peter Nugent. I was elected to this place at the same election as Peterâthe election of 24 March 1990. Whilst I have not served on parliamentary committees with Peter, I had the privilege of basically having the same portfolio as he had for a brief period, that of Aboriginal affairs. For a short period he was also on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation when I was a member and he was subsequently replaced by the honourable member for Murray.</para></talk.start><para>You do not have to be a minister to have made a contribution in this place. If anything, I think the fact that Peter Nugent was not a minister in this government says more about the government than it does about Peter Nugent himself. It actually showsâand I think it is a demonstrationâthat he stood for principle, he stood up for what he believed in. There is a theory that it might have cost him. That is a matter of speculation. Instead of lying down and being embittered or whatever, he made a contribution in other forms. He was active in the committee system. He never really held grudges.</para><para>I can remember that time and again in this place he made wonderful principled speeches. When I was shadow minister we often attempted to put forward amendments in a number of difficult debates to try to entice him over to our side of the House in the debate. He certainly made strident speeches, and he was a party loyalist. The best that we were able to do was when, on an odd occasion, he would go missing when a vote was taken. I respected him deeply for that. In many respects we are all party loyalists and it is a big thing to cross the floor or even to go missing. But he took that step. That is not to say necessarily that his party was wrong or whatever; it is a question of where you need to take your party with you.</para><para>On many of these issues, he was in a minority in his party, but history will treat him kindly. It is true that he was one of the first to rise and attack the member for Oxley for what was probably the lowest speech ever delivered in this place, and he deserves tribute for that, and so I salute him. More importantly, I know that as politicians we tend sometimes to score off one another. But to me the real testimony of Peter was that when he was shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs he actually went in to bat for the Aborigines and that he also went into bat for them when he was in government in a very difficult period. I do not want to sit in judgment one way or the other: history will record it, but sometimes it is not accurately recorded. I know how Patrick Dodson and the indigenous community felt about him: they loved him, they respected him and they held him in very, very high regard. </para><para>It is not easy to win the trust of the indigenous community, especially if you are a politician in this placeâgiven this nation's history over 200 yearsâbut he did have their respect throughout his period in this place and he was someone whom I know that Patrick Dodson, Lowitja O'Donoghue and others would want to be remembered with, in terms of this condolence motion. So on their behalf I say to his family that they loved him: he made a contribution and he remains with them. Physically he is not with us, but he is with us in spirit, and decisions that he took will come back time and time again so that, when we have to make difficult decisions as wellâand politics is not easy at timesâhe will be a benchmark. I salute him, I pay tribute to him, and I think you have a lot to be proud of.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>26689</page.no><name role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr NELSON</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLike the member for North Sydney, I have only been here for a short time and I have never spoken on a condolence motion. I have always felt, until now, that it was inappropriate to do so, no matter how worthy the people whom we were remembering. As Bob Charles said, we have a lot of colleagues here but we have fewer friends. But I can certainly say that I considered Peter to be a friend as much as a colleague. I first met Peter Nugent in 1991. I was then vice-president of the Australian Medical Association and I had been instrumental in organising a meeting to consider the treatment, or the ill-treatment, of many women in the medical profession. We organised a conference that was attended universally by women, but a man arrived: in fact, I thought he was at the wrong meeting or that, indeed, his motives might not have been what I subsequently found them to be. It was Peter Nugent, and he was the member for Aston.</para></talk.start><para>He came to the meeting and not only did he not make a perfunctory visit, as I think sometimes people in public life do, but he sat there all day and took notes and listened, and he even came to the dinner that we had that evening for these women. He said to me in the morning break, when in fact I asked him why he was there, `It's about time you ...'âand I will not use the actual word he said, but it was not a complimentary term to use of the medical professionâ`did something about this, and you need some encouragement to do it.' That began for me what has been a 10-year relationship, off and on, with Peter Nugent.</para><para>Every experience that I had with the man between then and his death has been, as so many others have said, consistent. His principles were not tradable commodities. He was a person whose life was summarised, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, as a life of courage. It was also, as the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister have said, a life of conviction. And above all of that was the question of conscience in everything that Peter did, everything that he said. Beneath it all was this question: what is the right thing to do? I do not know about my other colleagues and my friends here, but I often felt a little awkward in Peter's presence because there were some things in which I believe that he also believed in, but he had shown much more courage and had paid a higher price for his beliefs than I had; and that always made me feel a little awkward being around him, as much as I enjoyed his company. </para><para>In 1992 he again, as a member of parliament representing a critically important seat for the Liberal Party in Victoria, attended for two whole days a meeting here in Canberra to look at the human and health effects of unemployment. I suspect there was very little electoral support in it for him and I suspect that no-one knew he was there; but I knew he was there. In the following year, he attended another conference for two days, again in Canberra, on Aboriginal health and he made a contribution that I will not forget. It was essentially to remind all of us, as I think he might have said at the time, that whilst he represented an area of Australia which was very typical of middle Australiaâas the Prime Minister reminded us todayâwe had much to achieve when we looked at the appalling status of Aboriginal people, in their health and living standards and outcomes for life.</para><para>It is interesting that Peter died at a time when his seat was in the back row. I sat in the back row until very recently and I may end up back there. When young students come down here to Canberra, they ask you, `Where do you sit?' They have the idea that if you sit in the front you are important and if you sit in the back you are not important. I am sure that my colleagues here do a great deal to disabuse the next generation of that view, but I explain to them that the people with experience and wisdom are often placed in the back row to help those of us who do not have those things. And Peter was there for that reason as much as anything.</para><para>I had a very difficult time in my teenage years, as most of us do. I remember that when I was 14 my mother, seeking to reassure me about things, said that in the end your success in life would be measured by the causes and the people to whom you commit your life. It is interesting that we are well over two hours into this condolence motion, and most of us, including our Prime Minister, are still here for a man who finished his parliamentary career physically on the back row of the parliament but very much at its centre.</para><para>Last year in September I was privileged to go to an ASEAN meeting in Singapore. Of all of the things that surprised me about that meeting was the very high regard in which Peter Nugent was held by parliamentarians and leaders in our region. There was a genuine interest in his welfare, and respect for what he had done. So many others today have gone through the principles for which he stood. I feel above all else that Peter Nugent was a man who led from principle, not from position. He was a man whose principles led us to what in our hearts we knew so often to be right. He did not lead from the front row of the parliament; he led from the back row of the parliament, but he led from the front row in terms of principles.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition suggestedâand I think the member for North Sydney alluded to this alsoâthat in Peter's native land of Britain he might have been a Liberal-Democrat, and the member for La Trobe and others have mentioned also the broad church in the Liberal Party. It is worth remembering that Peter Nugent was in every sense a true Liberalâhe was a liberal Liberalâon economic issues, on industrial relations and on social policy. He looked at everything with an open mind. He personified that which Menzies described when he said that true Liberals owe great and imperative obligations to the sick, the weak and the unfortunate and that to every good citizen the state owes not only a chance in life but a self-respecting life. I feel that Peter Nugent personified and lived by those principles. The measure of character in people is not what they do or say when they are being watched but what they do or say when they are not being watched. He in every sense was a liberal Liberal, and I know he will be remembered long after many of us are footnotes in history. It has been a privilege to have known the man, to have worked with the man and to have played some small part in helping him with some of the causes that he thought were important.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>26691</page.no><name role="metadata">Hollis, Colin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLIS</name><name.id>DH4</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the motion moved by the Prime Minister. The sudden death of Peter Nugent came as a particular shock to me because, over the years, I got to know Peter quite well. For the last two parliaments I have been his deputy on the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I also worked with him on this committee for many years before that. Only quite recently we visited all the detention centres throughout Australiaâa particularly moving experience. At the time of his death we were putting the finishing touches to the committee's report on detention centres, which will be tabled during this session. </para></talk.start><para>The Human Rights Subcommittee is a particularly busy committee, but it is also one that is put under considerable pressure, especially emotional pressure. At our weekly meetings many diverse groups, all detailing abuses of human rights, come to see us not only from Australia but from overseas or representing people from overseas. A recent report of that committee was <inline font-style="italic">Hong Kong: the transfer of sovereignty</inline>. Peter, I and other members visited Hong Kong during this inquiry. It was particularly interesting because, although Peter was the chair of the committee and I was the deputy chair, among the committee members were Ian Sinclair and Barry Jones. They each thought they were the chair or the deputy chair of the committee, and I often wondered how long it would be before Peter would explode because, immediately we got into the question and discussion period, everyone in the region knew Ian Sinclair and Barry Jones. But Peter never once worried that they were so prominent in that visit.</para><para>We also recently brought down a report on Australia's regional dialogue on human rights and a particularly difficult one on freedom of religion, and the one we have been working on for some time now is the report on the detention centres. People here have also mentioned Amnesty International. I also worked closely with Peter on the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group and, until quite recently, Peter was the chair of that committee and I have been the secretary.</para><para>Working for many years with Peter on the Human Rights Subcommittee, as well as Amnesty, I came to appreciate his commitment to human rights. Human rights is a very complex issue and there are all sorts of balances that have to be struck. As the member for Reid mentioned, Peter understood the complexities surrounding human rights issues. It is not always easy to take a stand on human rights, as so often Peter did. Just look at the debate that is going on in this country, and will go on in this country, about the detention centres. It is an extremely complex and difficult issue that we have to come to terms with. I also visited Timor with Peter twiceâagain, we were looking at human rights issues.</para><para>The Prime Minister made mention of how well Peter's electorate office was organised. I never visited his electorate office but, having worked with him closely for some time on many issues, I have visited his office here in Parliament House many times. And my staff often visited his office at Parliament House and they were greatly impressed. Members of this chamber who have visited my office know that, although it might be one of the best decorated, it is certainly not the tidiest office in Parliament House. Papers are usually strewn over my desk. After a visit to Peter Nugent's office, my staff would always come back to me and say, `Colin, have you seen his desk? There is not a paper on his desk; there is no mess; there is nothing.' A hint was always there that I should follow Peter's example in the way he worked his own desk. I am not sure if it was Carol who made sure that it was so tidy, but I once challenged Peter on that and he said, `Colin, that is a result of'âwhatever it wasâ`18 or 20 years in the Air Force.' It most certainly made a lasting impression on me and especially on my staff.</para><para>I did attend his funeral. One of the sad duties that many of us as members have to perform is to attend funerals in our electorates of people we know and of people in the community. I am not a particularly religious person and I often find religious services at funerals a little difficult, but I often find that non-religious services do not convey somehow the correct atmosphere. I must say that Peter's service was a great service. It combined all the elements. I said to someone at the funeralâit may have been you, Mr Speakerâthat if I could have a funeral service like Peter's it would be great, if `great' is a word to use when talking about funerals. It really was a great celebration of his life. I thought that the celebration of his life in the service was a tremendous note. </para><para>I will miss the meetings with Peter and miss especially his commitment to human rights. This parliament and, indeed, this nation is the poorer for his passing. To you, Carol, and the Nugent family, I offer my sincere condolences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>26692</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to commence by leaking a secret out of the party room which you might also remember, Mr Speaker, because shortly after my appointment as a ministerâand, for those on the other side, you would realise that ministers do not get the right to speak in our party roomâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>âI have never noticed that with you, Wilson!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name></talker><para>âPeter got to his feet and said to the Prime Minister, `I've got to congratulate you warmly on Wilson Tuckey's appointmentâthis is going to take an hour off party room meetings every week.' And might I say that such was my mutual respect for Peter he got away with it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I really do need to say some very complimentary things about Peter Nugent. On one occasion, which will be remembered by the Chief Opposition Whip, Peter asked for protection from this parliamentâmany people did not know just how to do itâbecause he was being threatened with a defamation action by a public servant for writing on behalf of a constituent. I took that situation extremely seriouslyâfor someone who was not even a close acquaintance. With the cooperation of some backbenchers from the then government and some of my own colleagues, I had the honour to be able to get a resolution in this House that demanded of those people not only that they withdraw but that they apologise. It is a matter of record that that happened. This is of great interest because members will not be surprised to learn that at times Peter will have been encouraged to criticise some of my views. It is well known to me that he would always say to colleagues, `No, I won't have a bad word about Tuckeyâhe stuck to me when I needed him.' That is what Peter was all about. </para><para>The important thing that I think is worth saying is that, for one who did have disputes with Peter, I can never remember one that was acrimonious; in fact, to the contrary, it would usually be with that typical twinkle in his eye that he would disagree with you, put his point lucidly and frequently win the argument. I too had the opportunity to serve with him on the government Aboriginal affairs committee when we had to deal, as we did, with the legislation we brought to this House. More frequently than not Peter's contribution, while passionate, would be very practical. He was not, if I can use these words without being too insulting to anyone, a bleeding heart. He was a very committed person to the issues he believed in and, what is more, he would always come up with proposals that were practical and frequently achievable. I think that was one of his great assets. Contrary to the suggestion that he lacked a sense of humourâand I note that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation did make that pointâI found him very clever and very witty and often to the benefit of his own point of view. </para><para>If I can put probably not the small `l' liberal position on Peter Nugent, I thought he was a great fella, I greatly appreciated the contact I had with him and I agree with all the other words that have been said today about his commitment and his commitment to this place. I say to his family how deeply sorry I am that he is no longer with us. I do think that mine was a great associationâone with a person that I admired greatly and, as I have said, I will let never forget his contribution, Prime Minister, in the party room. It was probably very well said. On the other hand, as I have said, we were friends enough that he could get away with it.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>26693</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too would like to join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the previous speakers in offering condolences to Carol and the family of Peter Nugent. Many of us remember when we hear something that gives us a shock exactly what we were doing at that particular time. I was in transit from an overseas delegation and I had rung my office, as finally I could get a phone that worked, and said, `What's happening?' and they said, `We've just heard a news flash over the radio.' I was in the middle of a hotel foyer and all I did was plop onto my luggage and say, `Ring me back.' It was a shock. It was a shock because, of all people, he was the last I thought would have gone as suddenly as he did. </para></talk.start><para>I came into parliament with Peter in 1990. We were very observant when the clerks were telling us what we were to do in parliament and what we were not to do in parliament and we then went to lunch, and that was the first time I ever sat and spoke to him. I thereafter shared time with him on a number of committees, but more importantly we became closer, as the member for La Trobe has mentioned, through our parliamentary friendship groups. I, with my husband Ivo,  travelled with Peter and Carol as delegates in 1997 and again in 1999. Peter led many delegations and travelled as a member of parliament in delegations, but one of the things we have got to appreciate and understand is his firm commitment to Australia's place in the Asia-Pacific region. This came out very clearly not only when we were overseas but also when he spoke with ambassadors or delegations here in this parliament. I am sure that the member for Bradfield will not mind, but Peter would have said to you, `Just to be one of the 148 and having a seat in this parliament out of nearly 19Â½ million people is an honour in itself, no matter where you sit.'</para><para>I would like to relate some personal details other than on the humanitarian part, because that and Peter's firm commitment to Amnesty International have been mentioned. When we first went over in 1997 to ChinaâI refer to the delegation led by Bruce Reidâthere was a great debate one night at a dinner with our Chinese delegation. Peter believed intensely that the separation of Hong Kong would not work. It was quite a debate. I was thinking, `We are guests here; should we be doing this?' He was thumping the table and he said, `But I will give you my word that if it does work I will come back and tell you so.' Of course he did go back in 1999 and told them so. Mr Speaker, you would appreciate and understand that when we talk about friendship groups that sometimes travelâand I might add we do pay our own faresâin this case we were certainly looked after admirably by the Chinese government. We were met by Zhu Rongji, who has the position of Premier of China. The first time we met him he was Deputy Premier. When we went in 1999, we were not sure we were going to meet him. We were called forward as a delegation to sit down with him. Not only did all of us meet him and participate in the conversation with him but we were there for something like an hour and a halfâand this was the day before he left to go to the United States. Many of us, Peter included, said he was probably practising on us what he wanted to say when he arrived in the United States. I think we were very willing participants in that and I am sure we gave him more ammunition than he could possibly take with him when he went there.</para><para>I would also like to relate about that delegationâand this is why I feel so shocked about Peter's sad passingâthat we went to Tibet and on the second day I certainly succumbed to the altitude. I can tell you it was a dreadful feeling. In came Peter, not walking but joggingâI do not know whether he was trying to prove a point to Carolâand I will not say what he said I looked like because it is unparliamentaryâit begins with an `s' and an `h' and an `i'âbut I said, `If I look like that, I can assure you, Leader of the Delegation, that I feel even worse.' I was absolutely amazed that this man was jogging in. I do not know whether he jogged out again when the door was closed and I was feeling a whole lot worse. Needless to say, I left Tibet and waited for them back in China. He still pursued the program and went on with the rest of the delegationâand I congratulate them and admire them for that. </para><para>The other thing I would like to relate in this Houseâand Carol would appreciate itâis that I would see this wonderful couple come jogging out in their tracksuits leaving Parliament House at night, looking very trim, taut and terrific as they were walking out, and I would ask, `Where are you going?' They would say, `We're walking back to our residence.' Many a time Peter would say, `You know, Janice, walking keeps you fit,' the implication being, `It wouldn't hurt you to do a bit.' I took the pun on many an occasion and, Peter, wherever you are now, I want to tell you I am still here.</para><para>I really appreciated Peter Nugent as a man, as a person, as an individual and as a very courageous individual, and many speakers have said that. I could go on and on about some of the things that happened not only in the delegation but also in the Chinese friendship group, and I was particularly proud when Peter was the chairman and I was the vice-chairman this last time. </para><para>I would also mention that he defended our honour again in the embassy here in Canberra. We had organised last year a perpetual trophy for table tennis or ping-pong or whatever you want to call it. One of my colleagues (Judi, I will not mention your name) defended brilliantlyâI had to keep the ball in while she was hitting it outâbut it was a draw. It was a draw between our delegation members playing that night and the Chinese group. It all came down to a play-off between the ambassador and Peter, our chairman. Many of us waited with bated breath, but he did us proud and we won. He defeated the ambassador and it was certainly a proud moment. This was a way in which he could express at times to dignitaries the feelings of the parliament and his as a parliamentarian but at the same time cement a relationship, because he was a very warm and a very caring human being.</para><para>I would also like to put on record, while we talk about caring and being credible, that Carol and he just worked so well together. It is just so obvious not only when you see people working in an environment together but also when you mix with them on a social occasion or when you travel with them. They were certainly a very devoted couple. Carol, you will not mind me saying that he delighted so very much in your company. He loved his family and was very, very proud of it, and that is why Ivo and I say to Carol and to the family, whom I have not met, that we truly loved your father. He was a wonderful, kind human being. My husband and I send our condolences to you and to the staff as well; they are going to feel it.</para><para>He was very respected, as people have said, by indigenous Australians. In fact, a human rights council spokesman said when he died that he was a true Australian voice of conscience. Within his party, as many have said, he was classified as a moderate. He was forthright and yet he was courteous at all times. He did oppose Pauline Hanson and mandatory sentencing, but he supported immigration and reconciliation. He opposed detention centres for asylum seekers and he called for a national apology to Aborigines for past child removal policies. He always believed that the majority had the numbers to defend themselves while the minorities were the ones that needed our help because they did not have the strength or the numbers to defend themselves. Again I say: Peter, wherever you are, rest well. I know you have that place organised and you will have it as spick and span as your office was, as people have mentioned, and more importantly I know they will all be organised there. Again I say to Carol that we will miss him as well and that your memories will always be there with you. I respect the condolence motion that has been moved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>26694</page.no><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEHL</name><name.id>AE4</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have to say at the outset that I do not really want to speak on this motion; I would much prefer to look to my left and see Peter Nugent's smiling face there. I think that is an indication of how we will all miss him. But, since he has left us and this motion is before the House, I certainly rise to speak in support of it and to offer to Carol and all of Peter's extended family my condolences. I know that many of my National Party colleagues who will not have the opportunity of speaking to this motion want me to associate them with the sympathy and condolences that we are expressing.  </para></talk.start><para>Peter was a very rare person. If one has listened carefully to the debate, one would know that a great many words which start with `c' have been used about himâcaring, committed, conscientious, consistent and so on. He was all of those things. I feel privileged that I have had the opportunity of working with him within the parliament in several areas. Amnesty has been mentioned a lot. I am one of the vice-chairmen of the parliamentary group and I have always respected the work Peter did in Amnesty. I also respected totally his decision to resign as chairman in the particular circumstances. Between 1993 and 1996 I was Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and I can tell you that Peter was a great example and I learnt a lot from him about Aboriginal affairs and about the needs of our indigenous fellow Australians. I am not going to repeat what has been said so many times, but if you worked with Peter in those areas you got to know, to acknowledge and to recognise his passion for justice. Certainly, mention has been made of his passion for human rights.</para><para>China has been mentioned quite a bit. Peter was a great friend of China, and I regard myself as a great friend of China too. Many people have found it perhaps inconsistent that Peter could be Chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group and also be such an amazingly strong advocate for human rightsâbut they are wrong. There is no inconsistency there at all. I do not know how many times Peter visited China. I have been five times. As far as I am aware, every member of this parliament who goes to China mentions human rights. I know that every time I have been I have taken the opportunity of pursuing the issues that concern us all. I know that Peter did that as well, and there is no inconsistency in that. I happen to believe that you are going to achieve more from friendly discussion than from hitting a country like China over the head with a baseball bat. Influence through friendly discussion is what Peter did and what I have tried to do.</para><para>There is another trait I really admired him for. Unfortunately, a great many people in our countryâand perhaps even a few in hereâare of the brand of person who says, `Don't confuse me with the facts; I've already made up my mind,' and there is no way you can change their viewpoint under any circumstances. That was not Peter Nugent. The first time that I went to Tibet was in 1992. I came back with certain views which were at variance with the commonly held ideas about Tibet and the Chinese administration of it. I published a very detailed report and I put forward a private member's motion in this place. A number of my colleagues on both sides disagreed with me very much, and Peter was one of them. But once Peter had been to Tibet he changed his views, because he too had been there and seen. I know that the member for Prospect, Janice Crosio, has also changed her views. It is amazing what knowledge can do. I find that the people who are critical of what Peter may have done, of what I may have done or of what Janice Crosio may have done are those who have never been there. The point that I would like to make is that Peter never had his mind set in concrete. He was prepared to listen, to observe, to learn and to vary the attitude that he took. I think that he was a very good parliamentarian. He was a very good man, and I am going to miss him. I conclude by reading a sentence from a note from Carol to John Forrest, the National Party Chief Whip, in response to our condolences. She said:</para><quote><para>So much has been said about him, and we as a family are so proud of the achievements of his public life. He left us a wonderful legacy.</para></quote><para>Carol, we are proud of him too. He has left this parliament and Australia a wonderful legacy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26696</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also would like to add to the comments of those who have spoken on this condolence motion for Peter Nugent. On the day of Peter's death, I had a call from one of our local papers to ask what comment I would like to make about Peter. Whilst I did not know Peter very well, I could answer the question very easily. He was a thoroughly decent bloke. Peter was one of those characters who give this place a good name. He was a man of principle, a hardworking local member, an individual dedicated to the role of the parliament and a committed family man. I would run into Peter on numerous occasions at functions around the traps of Whitehorse, one of our local councils. Whilst Whitehorse formed only a small part of Peter's seat, he always took the time to go to these functions.  </para></talk.start><para>Peter was a passionate Australian citizen. We were always together at numerous citizenship ceremonies, and he always spoke of his fondness for the day he took out his Australian citizenship. He always spoke about how he received his native plant and how he had watched that plant grow and flourish, like his life had in Australia. Peter often spoke on these occasions of the immense pride he had in being present when his children also became members of this great country of ours. I was pleased to see that Deirdre also made that reference at the funeral, as he was absolutely, immensely proud of that occasion.</para><para>Peter's commitment to the plight of Aboriginals and his drive for reconciliation have been spoken of often. His passionate stance was well known, and he demonstrated this commitment on numerous occasionsâoften to his own detriment. At an evening when we were both addressing a Whitehorse friends of reconciliation group, Peter impressed the crowd immensely with his wide knowledge of Aboriginal issues and his absolute commitment to finding a resolution. I would like to read from one of our local papers:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Reconciliation loses activist</inline></para><para>Wurundjeri elder Joy Murphy-Wandin has talked of her sadness at the passing of Aston MP Peter Nugent and highlighted his contribution in helping Aboriginal people. </para><para>`It's not been a good couple of years for us. We lost Charles Perkins and Bob Maza. Now we've lost Peter Nugent,' she said. </para><para>`He had a strong passion for helping disadvantaged people. He saw that people should be acknowledged and recognised for their differences.' </para><para>Ms Murphy-Wandin said she and Mr Nugent had the same aspirations for human rights. </para><para>She said they could see the difficulties facing Aboriginal people. </para><para>`When on traditional land he always observed protocol and showed respect,' she said.</para></quote><para>I do not think we can add any higher praise than that praise from one of our Victorian Aboriginal elders.</para><para>Peter was an internationalist, as many have said. One has only to look at the speeches he made in the House of Representatives to see how important he considered foreign policy. A quick flick through his parliamentary speeches since only 1998 and you find mention of the Pacific islands, Korea, Fiji and East Timor, which he visited twice after the intervention of the peacekeeping force, as part of a parliamentary delegation. Not only did Peter show an abiding interest in the development of countries in our region but he was also keen to explore issues affecting the fate of people living in countries far from our shoresâissues such as the destruction of Buddhist statues in Afghanistan, the Middle East peace process, persecution of the Baha'i community in Iran and famine and war in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Peter believed strongly in the sanctity of human rights and was never content to just sit back and accept the word of so-called voices of authority. Peter was an advocate of the oppressed whenever persecution, prejudice or conflict reared their heads. Peter's obvious interest in international affairs was coupled with a keen interest in local matters. He was able to keep on top of all the pressing issues in his electorate, while still maintaining a very studious interest in matters abroad. He maintained a dedicated balance in concerns for those near and far right up to the time of his passing.</para><para>Peter's stance on human rights was well known. This and his keen interest in the region where we live have been demonstrated through his words in this House, through his actions in his electorate and through his committee work. I last saw Peter at a function at the Chinese consul's home in Melbourne where we had a dinner prior to Peter going on his last trip to China. Peter again demonstrated his friendship with China. His understanding of Chinese customs was well demonstrated through his knowledge of mai-tai. It was an unfortunate experience for me to learn what mai-tai was and Peter took great delight in demonstrating how he could toast anybody under the table. As always, Carol was by Peter's side on that occasion. Today I pass on to her my sympathies for her great loss. Peter often spoke with pride of his children and the joys and worries of his teenage stepchildren. To them I also pass on my sympathies. The parliament has lost a decent bloke who gave this place and those in it a better name. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>26697</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also want to strongly support the remarks of all of the speakers who have gone before in offering profound sympathy to Carol and her family for what was a life too short, a life that would have been long and full of love if of course Peter had lived to the 80-plus years usually expected for Australian men. I first met Peter in 1990 when I was very keen to win preselection for the then state Labor seat of Bayswater and that was part of Peter's patch. He was very generous and straight speaking in his advice to me then. Unfortunately I did not succeed, but that was the beginning of dialogue with Peter on many things.</para></talk.start><para>As a number of people have said before me now, Peter will be particularly remembered for his contribution to public life in the areas of foreign affairs, human rights, indigenous affairs and immigration. I once said to Peter, `What about adding regional Australians to your list of the disadvantaged you care so much about?' He suggested his plate was full, and of course it really was full in the sense that he cared profoundly about those who could not help themselves. He was always absolutely thorough and professional in the way that he prepared his cases of advocacy, and perhaps that is why he was so effective.</para><para>In particular I want to refer to Peter's contribution to indigenous affairs as a Liberal and as part of our government. I had the honour of succeeding Peter on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in 1997. I remember, soon after our Prime Minister nominated me to replace Peter, I was very proud and went around to Peter and he said, `Look, here are all my files.' And he had a collection of nearly seven years of every piece of paper, every report and every interaction that had gone on in that council over those years. He was able to be absolutely thorough and full of information about what had gone on in that period of time.</para><para>Peter's understanding of indigenous affairs was such that to him the symbolic aspect of reconciliation was of critical importanceâthe welcoming protocols and the recognition that some indigenous peoples are concerned about a treaty. But he also understood that it was a mockery and a nonsense if all they had were empty protocolsâif they still had two-year-old indigenous children suffering profound deafness. Practical reconciliationâthat is, the issues of housing, health, unemployment and povertyâwas for him equally significant and absolutely essential. He of course played an important part in the formation of Howard government policy, which is both symbolic and practical when it comes to indigenous affairs in this country.</para><para>The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was very difficult to belong to in terms of the energy required. It involved work on most weekends for year after year. I know the member for Banks also remembers the time commitment, energy and emotion required to work in what was for me one of the most important councils I have been associated with. As the member for Banks, one of the other reconciliation council members, said, Peter was and is profoundly missed as a past member of that council. His legacy has been one of making sure that our government has the right policies when it comes to indigenous affairs. He was very much a part of the march in both Sydney and Melbourne when with other Liberals he expressed concern for and understanding of the needs of future indigenous Australians and improved race relations in this country. </para><para>My leaving parliament each night often seemed to coincide with Carol and Peter's leaving. I used to observe them in tracksuits and feel a little envious of Carol sharing so much of Peter's time since, as members of parliament, most of us have to leave our spouses and life partners behind. On the other hand, Carol has now been left with too short a time to remember Peter. We all express our sincere regret for the loss of Peter. He was an important Australian. As a member of parliament, he made a real mark, and his legacy is the policies that we now want to ensure will make a difference in the life of all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>26698</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen members from one side of the House speak kindly of a member from the opposite side in a condolence motion the public could be excused for wondering how sincere those comments are. In the case of Peter Nugent and the many fine tributes paid to his memory today there should be no doubting the sincerity of those comments. Peter Nugent was a man I greatly admired and respected. Although I only knew him for a few short years, he has made a lasting impression on me and on the way I have come to understand the role of members of parliament.</para></talk.start><para>One of my earliest experiences with Peter came when I attended my first Amnesty International meeting. Peter chaired the meeting, which was attended by members from both sides of this chamber. At the end of the meeting Peter called for someone to help organise Amnesty International 1999 Candle Day and asked for volunteers to stay behind after the meeting. I was a little slow in getting to my feet to leave the meeting and found myself the only one left. Peter, in a very diplomatic way, looked around, saw that I was the only one there and thanked me for volunteering to help with the task.</para><para>Peter's commitment to Amnesty went far beyond just being seen at meetings. My closest experience with Peter came during our visit to China and Tibet in 1999 as members of the China-Australia Friendship Group, which Peter chaired. I was able to see first-hand Peter's diplomacy skills, which were called for on several occasions. In Beijing, as has already been mentioned, we were honoured to be able to meet the Chinese Premier, Zhu Rongji. Peter's inquiries suggested that Premier Zhu would take questions on a wide range of topics, including the issue of human rights in Tibet and the status of Taiwan. So Peter put some quite sharp questions to Premier Zhu, and received, to our surprise, some frank but cordial replies. We later realised that Premier Zhu was leaving for the United States the day after our 1Â½ hour interview and it could be said was using Peter's questions as batting practice before facing the Washington media.</para><para>Another occasion called for Peter's diplomatic skills to explain an embarrassing moment. The group was being hosted at a magnificent banquet at a secondary school in China. The school's principal, a delightful woman in her 50s, took great interest in the group and, through an interpreter, constantly questioned Peter about Australia. By the time the 15th course came around and we were waving the white flag at the banquet, a specialty came outâturtle soup. Here was a bowl of turtle soup with a whole turtle in the middle of it. It was absolutely unreal. We had the head bobbing up and down, the shell; it was incredible. One of the members of the delegation, whom I am not going to nameâI am not even going to say if it was a male member or a female memberâwas helping to serve the soup and used an unfortunate turn of phrase when offering a piece of the turtle to one of the members of the delegation. This caused the members to break up with laughter, to the amusement of the principal, who turned to Peter and asked what we were laughing at. I had always meant to ask Peter what he told the principal. I suspect he did not give her the literal meaning of the words used, but she laughed anyway.</para><para>That visit to China gave me an insight into the constructive role that backbench members can play. Peter provided an excellent role model as leader of that delegation. His understanding of human rights issues, combined with his understanding of the politics of a situation, was much to be admired. His approach to engagement rather than confrontation will, I am certain, be proved to be correct. Peter applied these same skills in addressing the issues of Aboriginal reconciliation and mandatory sentencing. Here again I am sure we will see Peter's stand on these issues to be proven correct. It seemed to me that Peter Nugent's guiding principle was that politics is the art of the possible. He saw not only the injustice in the world but also the means to overcome that injustice through political action. While Peter may not have seen the fruits of his labour in his lifetime, he can be assured that others will continue in his footsteps, and they will definitely prevail. </para><para>As I began saying, Peter Nugent was a member of this parliament that I greatly admired and respected. The circumstances of his untimely death serve as a reminder to us all of the pressure that many members endure as part of their role. When I think of Peter's efforts to maintain his fitness, I too still picture Peter and Carol at about 11 o'clock or 11.15 of a night-time in their tracksuit pants setting off from the House at fast pace to walk to their Canberra accommodation. I note Peter was very proud of me and the member for Prospect because one day he actually saw us in our tracksuit pants and our sneakers.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">â</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Z</name.id><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name></talker><para>âHe did! He was quite proud. He virtually clapped us when we came back. But, sadly, I never had the opportunity of telling Peter that we only ever walked around the House once, and I do not think, member for Prospect, we have done it again. But, Carol, in Peter's memory I think we will bring in our tracksuit pants and our sneakers and we will start on our exercise again. For the second time in the life of this parliament, we can see stress as the prime suspect in the loss of a fine member. To Carol and to your family, my husband, Geoff, and I extend to you our deepest sympathy in your sad loss of a wonderful man.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>26699</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. I was deeply moved to be asked by Carol Nugent to speak at Peter's funeral service, and I would like to voice in this place the sentiments I expressed on that occasion of sadness and reflection on a life so suddenly and unexpectedly come to an end.</para></talk.start><para>Peter Nugent's death has taken away a husband, a father, a friend, a colleague and a parliamentarian of conscience, honour and courage. We live in a society that today is, more than ever, sceptical about its politicians, a society in which many often perceive politicians as placing partisan self-interest and partisan advantage ahead of the national interest. Yet with Peter Nugent's passing we have witnessed an outpouring of sadness and respect from people in the electorate he served so well, from his political friends and his political opponents and from the community groups and institutions that he worked with. There are many of us who may be cynical about the politician. There are few of us who can remain so when faced with an honourable man. Peter Nugent was an honourable manâa man of character, conscience and commitment.</para><para>I first met Peter professionally in the late 1990s when I was state director and he was running as the candidate for Aston, and we enjoyed the somewhat frictional interaction that I think is inherent in this relationship. But Peter won the seat, and I did not really come to know him until I joined him in the parliament in the mid-1990s. Peter had seen and done many thingsâas an officer, as a businessman and as a migrant. He found a calling in politics because he cared deeply about people and because he believed that he could contribute something of value to his constituents and his chosen country. Peter believed that the quality of a human's life and a nation's commitment to human rights were more important than political expedience or popular gain. He saw disadvantage in human terms, not theoretical ones. The squalid conditions of Aboriginal children without clean water or sanitation, the plight of refugees, the disadvantage of minority groupsâall of these troubled him deeply. Peter argued, and I use his words: </para><quote><para>Majorities, of their nature, have power. It is minorities who are always in danger of suffering disadvantage and discrimination.</para></quote><para>He believed, and I use his words again:</para><quote><para>Any civilised society has to support, and to continue to support, groups that are disadvantaged.</para></quote><para>Peter had witnessed the effects of poverty and disadvantage on Aboriginal communities and he never ceased to remind us of the true circumstance of indigenous communities and the hardships they endure. He was deeply committed to reconciliation and to the character of our nation. He said:</para><quote><para>We will never be able to truly celebrate until we can say we have delivered a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage, and provides justice and equity for all.</para></quote><para>Peter abhorred those who cynically tried to deny the fact of Aboriginal disadvantage. He saw these denials as an affront not only to his own sense of decency but to that of the electorate that he represented. As he declared in this House in his seminal speech on the member for Oxley's speech:</para><quote><para>I will challenge them and I will rebut them at every opportunity because I believe that is one of the reasons why my electorate sent me here.</para></quote><para>Peter was unremittingly courageous in the pursuit of social justice. He made the most of the opportunities he had to make a difference and he was proud of the impact that he had in the parliament, on his committees and in the party room. I still remember him telling me after he had once again made a difference that he had never been prouder as a member of parliament than when he took his stand opposing mandatory sentencing of juveniles in the Northern Territory.</para><para>It has often been remarked that Peter had a strong personal following in his electorate of Aston. I believe his constituents saw Peter for what he was and understood what he believed in, and they admired him for it. Peter Nugent was an honourable and decent parliamentarian who saw suffering and disadvantage and worked for justice and equity. His were the politics of compassion, not opportunism. He was a true Liberal in every sense, and he understood the rights and obligations that the party's traditions imposed. His death means that Australia has lost a voice against poverty and disadvantage. The Liberal Party has lost a respected colleague. The people of Aston have lost an honourable representative. I and many others have lost a valued friend. Carol and Peter's family have lost a good man, father and husband. Our hearts go out to them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>26700</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on this condolence motion and to add my sympathies to Carol, the family and staff. I intend to speak only briefly, given that so many members have already said so much about Peter and his work, but I have a particular reason for wanting to speak, that being that we share a birthday. Whilst a birthday shared 29 or 30 years apart may not be seen as something that is very important, when you are a politician and your birthday is April Fool's Day, believe me, you cling to the fact that someone on the other side of the House also has this birthday. I want to add that as one of the many reasons that people in this House are expressing their compassion and concern today about the sad event of Peter Nugent's death.</para></talk.start><para>Like many others, I also want to tell a brief story about my encounters, if you like, with Peter. The member for Hindmarsh said that she did not want to paint the former member for Aston as a saint, and she described him as a patriarch, but not sexist. I think Carol will enjoy the retelling of a story I have which clearly places Peter in the patriarch category and also highlights the order with which he thinks of things, which many other speakers have already described.</para><para>The story is from the delegation to China that so many members have spoken of. I was a very late addition to this delegation when another member was unable to attend. As I was a new member, a young member and an opposition member, it was very clear that in Peter's hierarchyâand probably everybody else'sâI was fairly low down the scale on this trip to China. Peter was a very diligent delegation leader and felt that, when we were in formal meetings, it was important to introduce each of the members of our delegation and describe them in some detail. Having a little story of interest about each of them as he introduced them was his style to give a bit of colour to the delegation. There certainly was plenty of colour on that delegation by the time he had introduced the member for Prospect, the member for La Trobe, the member for Moreton, the member for Pearce and many others. By the time he got to me, it was a little difficult to think of something new and interesting to say. Much to my horror, he introduced me as coming to China to find myself a husband! Not only was I shocked then but I was more shocked when, after the meeting, I was promptly handed cards by all the Chinese delegates and not left in peace. </para><para>I am sad to say that Peter was not successful in his work, Carol. I am not using this as an opportunity to seek any offers, I might say, but I did think that was a story that was worth telling. Peter took it in a very good-natured way when I pointed out that perhaps that was not the most appropriate way for me to be introduced at future meetings. That encouraged him to do it several times more, but he did, nevertheless, take my gentle chastisement very well.</para><para>I did not realise the skills Peter had until I was in the position later of leading a delegation. Whilst many other people have lost a close friend, something I will carry with me in my future parliamentary career is knowing the importance, as a leader of a delegation and as a parliamentarian, of respecting that we represent the whole country when we travel overseas. Peter was very good at putting aside the partisan tensions that may sometimes occur. For those of us like me who perhaps did not share the views a number of others have expressed about the developments in Tibet, he was very tolerant in allowing us to ask questions and express our views, as we felt was important. He was very patient in the way he did that and he showed great dignity. That is something that many of us have obviously learnt from and will be able to continue to use in our future careers. I want to place that on the record and also pass on my condolences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26701</page.no><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RONALDSON</name><name.id>XT4</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo Carol, Deirdre and Ian, Barry and Mandy, Christopher, David, and Judy and Sandra, Carol's good mates as well as work colleagues, a lot has been said about Peter today and I will not go over his history, but I do want to talk about a couple of things. I, like the member for La Trobe and others in the chamber, was part of that great class of 1990 which generated with it extraordinary excitement. There was a large group from Victoria; we had worked very closely during 1989 to get to that position. The member for Kooyong was the state director. While we were a difficult group, we were a group that was on a mission. </para></talk.start><para>As Carol knows, and as has been said before, no-one wants to paint Peter as a saint. Peter had his weaknesses and his strengths, like all of us. What we are doing today is not just celebrating Peter's life as a parliamentarian but actually celebrating parliament itself. Peter was a proud man: he was proud of his family and his electorate and he was extremely proud to be a member of this House. What we are celebrating today, as well as Peter, is that this House provides a unique opportunity for a very small group of people to express their true beliefs and to pursue the passions that they have. The difference between some members is not so much their commitment to the job or to their electorate but how far they pursue those opportunities that are presented to them. Peter Nugent took every single opportunity that this place presented. He was deeply committed to social causes. He was committed to a wide range of things and he used this unique opportunity to pursue them 110 per cent. Carol and the family can be proud of that. He was proud to be a parliamentarian. He was proud to be a member of the Liberal Party, and he was proud of the fact that we do have a broad church. That was something that he worked within, and he worked very hard to maintain that broad church and to provide the opportunities for others to work within that broad church. </para><para>Some things have been said about what might or might not have been for Peter. The first thing I should say is that I actually thought I was friends with Bob Charles between 1990 and 1996, but obviously I was not. It was a large group that came in from Victoria in 1990 and, yes, the opportunities did not come Peter's way and the way of others from Victoria, but that was a fact of life and it was nothing to do with anything else except the state we were from. We were proud of the fact that we had cabinet and other ministers from Victoria. There were simply no places there. Let us be very careful about how we describe Peter's failure to become a minister. Peter Nugent did not become a minister for any reason other than the state he was from. I have said quite publicly that he would have made a damn good minister, and everyone in this chamber knows that, but the opportunity just did not come his way. He was, like so many of us, not at the right place at the right time. But, as Bob said, that was not an issue that preoccupied Peter at all.</para><para>We were also part of the QF654 group, as is the member for Kooyong and others in the chamber, that used to catch the 7.15 flightâthe PM is giving me an incredulous lookâfrom Melbourne to Canberra. Peter and I caught that every year for 11Â½ years. Sometimes we would talk politics; sometimes we talked other things. Carol was there. I would like to give great credit to Carol. People have talked about Peter's tracksuitâI can tell you that the tracksuit he used to wear before he met Carol was an utter disgrace. You did everyone a great favour, Carol, by getting rid of that grotty old thing he used to wander around in and replacing it with something far more elegant. </para><para>Someone was talking about `being up the back' and whether up the back is the right place to be or whether it is down the front, but the members for Macquarie, Curtin and Sturt within earshot would have heard theâ how can I put this?âsomewhat age challenged members for Aston and Fairfax, who maintained a running commentary from up the back here from the minute we sat down for two o'clock question time until whatever time it might finish. They have been, quite unfairlyâI don't think it came from me; perhaps it didâlikened to those two gentlemen in <inline font-style="italic">The Muppets</inline> who sit up in the balcony providing running commentary. And I knew, as soon as I heard Peter say `Ronno', that he was not inquiring as to my health or the health of the member beside me but that he had something that he thought needed attending to during question time. I do not think Peter's mind ever stopped workingâwhether it was the running commentary here or the work he did in his electorate. Let me tell you, when he talked, family was always number one, but second was always that electorate of his. We all try to be the most parochial in this place, but Peter was genuinely proud of those people he represented. </para><para>The only good thingâand I mean the only good thingâthat came out of that event a couple of weeks ago was to hear, especially in the morning but also in the afternoon, the radio jockeys talking about the contribution that members of this place make. It forced those radio jockeys to focus on the demands of this job. The talk about Peter, certainly on Melbourne radio, was generated predominantly by two constituents who rang in to 3LO, I think, at about 10.30 in the morning to talk about Peter Nugent and what he had done. For the rest of the day Peter's contribution was put in the context of what most other members of this House do as well. We ourselves sometimes forget that we should be celebrating the opportunities we have and celebrating the likes of Peter Nugent. He maximised his opportunities. The challenge for all of us, in looking at Peter's life, especially as a parliamentarian, is to seize the chance that we have and to do as he did: to make sure that every waking hour we have we maximise the opportunities we are given. </para><para>Peter Nugent will be remembered for a long time. He will be remembered for maximising those opportunities. He will be remembered by his electorate. Like the situation of the schoolyard bully and a kid coming up and saying, `I don't like you doing that,' leadership is often about making the hard decisions and making the tough calls, and Peter was never afraid to tackle the bully in the schoolyard and say that he did not think something was appropriate behaviour. He was a great bloke and a terrific parliamentarian, and he will be very much missed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>26703</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Keefe, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr O'KEEFE</name><name.id>CE4</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to add some comments in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. When driving to the other side of the city to attend the service at the Waverley Christian Centre in Wantirna South, I thought, `Why am I going, apart from the fact that I knew Peter as a person and had met Carol from time to time?' For what it is worth, I think one of the most significant things that can be said about you in this place is that you have the respect of both sides of the House, irrespective of your political party or process. I thought it was important not only for Carol and the family but also for Peter's colleagues, who were deep in their own emotions about this event, to know that many of us on this side of the House deeply respected Peter as a politician and as a person, in the way he conducted himself and the causes for which he stood. I thought it was important to be there simply to show that. I hope that everyone who was present at the very moving celebration of Peter's life and contribution drew something from the fact that he was so widely regarded and respected on both sides of the House, as has been shown by the contributions being made by members here today.</para></talk.start><para>I add only one small anecdote to the rich history that these comments will provide for Carol and the family. I was at Sydney airport with members of a delegation going to South America late last yearâabout October, I think it wasâand we ran into Peter in the lounge. He was getting ready to head off to New York on yet another attempt to persuade someone at the UN to his point of view on a particular topic. I remember thinking to myself, `Here we are going off as a group with the mutual support of each other's company and here is Peter, not even with Carol in this instance, trudging off by himself to go and do the job in his own way again.' Those who have done it know that jumping on a plane and flying by yourself for hours and hours to do these things is not all that pleasant. I thought to myself, `When does he ever give up?' It is obvious that he didn't until it gave up on him. The respect in which he was held on both sides of the House is something which is important for Carol and the family to know, and I wanted to say a few words simply to reflect that unequivocally for you.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>26703</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to place on record my condolences for Carol and her family and my good wishes to them in the future. Carol and Peter were dinner companions of mine here in Canberra. We used to go out together regularly because we had so much in common and I got to know Peter and Carol very well. From 1993 onwards, I used to be a regular person in his office at the cheese, chocolate and drinks parties he had which the member for Hindmarsh talked about. What struck me very much about Peter and at the funeral at Wantirna a couple of weeks ago was that he was a very unaffected man. At that funeral it was talked about how his favourite thing to do in the whole world was to get into his tracky-daksâI think that is what they were called at the funeralâand sit back with Carol with a bottle of red wine in front of the fire and say that this was the happiest time of his life. It was reflected here in Canberra, because my other enduring memory of Carol and Peter is seeing them, as I arrived every morning, walking along in their tracksuits and going home every night. That sums up what an unaffected and unpretentious person Peter Nugent was. There was nothing about him that made you feel uneasy. He was easy company to be with. He was an easy dinner and drinks companion.</para></talk.start><para>I had a very high regard for Peter Nugent and for the causes with which he associated himself over his parliamentary career. Many of them were causes that I shared with him. He was very proud of the role he played in parliament over those 11 years in the areas in which he took a great interest. He was very proud of his role in indigenous affairs. He thought one of the great achievements of his political career was the six years that he had on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I know that he was sorry to give that up but was very pleased to have had the opportunity over that time to have contributed to indigenous affairs on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </para><para>He was shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs in the 37th parliament. That was when we became friends for the first time, because he approached me and asked whether I would go on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs so that I could help them out in a policy sense as a new member of parliament. He knew that I had a keen interest in indigenous relationships. I agreed to go on that committee. When he ended his role as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, I offered to go off the committee for him if he wanted to go back on it. That is what happened: I gave up my position and he took the position over, because I knew how keen he would be, if he was not to be the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, to be on that committee. I have to say that the Aboriginal affairs committee was not a highly sought-after committee in the parliament, yet Peter Nugent regarded it with great importance and enough importance for him to go back onto that committee when he got the opportunity.</para><para>I was proud to walk for reconciliation across the bridge in Sydney with him, with Carol and with a number of our colleagues. We felt like a few but happy band of coalition MPs that walked across the bridge in Sydney. We both flew from our respective cities to go to Sydney for that momentous day. I think Peter and Carol were very proud to be part of that walk across the bridge, because he believed very strongly in reconciliation. It was one of his lodestars: he believed very strongly in trying to do something for the welfare, health, education, housing and employment prospects of indigenous Australians. So he strongly supported the practical reconciliation policies of this government. But he also supported an apology for the stolen generation; he had lots to say about black deaths in custody when that was a major issue; and he opposed mandatory sentencing when that issue came up. I was proud to stand with him, as were a number of our colleagues, on that issue to do with mandatory sentencing.</para><para>One of the most testing times in politics for Peter Nugent was the native title debate. From 1993 to 1998 he took a keen part in the native title debate, always trying to get the government and the people to see it from the point of view not only of the practical effects of native title in the community but also that indigenous people held the land so dear that native title was something that should not be dismissed but should be embraced and made to work. He tried very hard to help to get native title to work so that all Australians could adopt it, accept it and move forward with it.</para><para>He was proud of his role in the area of foreign affairs, and he used the chairmanships of a number of committees to promote his interest in it. He was chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; he was chairman of the foreign affairs and trade committee of the coalition back benchâI was a member of that with himâhe was chairman of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group; and he was chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. He took great delight in telling me about how he always raised issues of human rights when he went to China. </para><para>He enjoyed being a burr under the saddle to the state of Israel because of his support for the Palestinian causes. He and I did not share the same view on that issue and it was always a great source of amusement to both of us that we would get arguing about the Middle East with Israel's position and the Palestinians' position. He really enjoyed niggling me about his trip to Israel and the Middle East, which the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation referred to earlier, about how he was going to lead it and how he was going with Leo McLeay and Anthony Albanese, because he knew that I thought it was a bad idea to go. He got great enjoyment out of being on a differing railway track from me on that issue, because we agreed on so many other things. </para><para>He was also a great advocate of human rights in East Timor, when it was unfashionable as well as when it was fashionable. He used to give speeches about East Timor and human rights. Going back for a long time when the official government policy was really not to talk about it if we could possibly help itânot our government policy but the policy going back 20 yearsâPeter Nugent did not adopt that position. He would always argue for human rights in East Timor and, when it became fashionable, I think he was delighted but bemused with the rapidity of people jumping on the bandwagon in debating issues about human rights in East Timor. </para><para>He was also very proud of the role he played in the party room and in the parliament. Just speaking for myself, I will miss him in the party room because I sat across the gangway from him and I used to enjoy his very precise, very correct speeches in the party room about issues that were important to him. He was very committed to protecting the disadvantaged in the community. He was committed to multiculturalism, and he argued about that in the party room. He advocated his causes. He did not just hold them; he actually went out there and advocated them. The party room is the opportunity in politics to try to move your party in the direction in which you want it to go. He was a committed Liberal, a small `l' liberal and proud to be described as such. Whether he was described as a Whig or a Deakinite liberal or whatever it was, he was very proud of that fact. He tried always in those 11Â½ years in parliament to move the party towards that small `l' liberal position and he used the party room to do so. </para><para>Trish Worth and I were in the chamber when he responded to Pauline Hanson. He did it with great passion. It was an opportunity, and he took it, to lay down some markers about his philosophical view of the direction in which Australia should go. What is perhaps not well known is that one of the reasons he joined the Liberal Party was that he wanted to promote multiculturalism as a policy of the Liberal Party. He spent his whole career fighting for the cause of multiculturalism within the Liberal Party.</para><para>He was also very proud of the fact that he was a great campaigner. He won Aston from Labor, he enjoyed beating Labor in the subsequent three elections and he was looking forward to beating Labor again at the end of the year in the general election. He got great glee out of the fact that at every election the Labor Party worked terribly hard in Aston because of its marginality. He liked the strategy and the toing-and-froing of the politics of winning a local seat, and he did it very well. He was a great model for many people because he was terribly local and terribly grass roots. Regardless of the standing of the party at any given time in the political cycle, the standing of Peter Nugent in his electorate was always particularly high. He was a very reliable person to have as a candidate in that sort of seat, because you could be sure that he would be winning or trying to win.</para><para>I will miss him. He was a great friend. We supported each other in many things. We voted for each other at every opportunity we had within the party. I will miss him for that as I will miss him for many other things. On behalf of Carolyn and me, I would like to pass on my condolences to Carol. Carol is the mother of twins and, in the last six months, she has been giving us sage advice about how to manage that issue of twins. I hope that that will continue. I look forward to continuing my friendship with Carol and I will miss a great friend in Peter Nugent. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>26705</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy remarks will be very briefânot out of disrespect to Peter Nugent, his family or his memory, but because many of those opposite who were his party colleagues wish to contribute to this debate. My contact with Peter Nugent was through the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group, of which he was president and I was a member. It is in that capacity and in a relationship in which I have had some professional involvement over many years that I would like to pay him a very specific personal and professional tribute. </para></talk.start><para>I think it is fair to say that in this chamber Peter Nugent was the principal parliamentary champion of the Australia-China relationship. Because of the complexity of that relationship and because of its inherent importance to Australia's long-term national interests, it is a relationship which demands having a parliamentary champion such as Peter Nugent. For Peter, China was front and centre in his calculation of our nation's long-term national interests. It was not that he was uncritical of China, as many other speakers have noted in this debate. He was a consistent critic of China's human rights policy and performance. At the same time, he was a consistent and eloquent advocate that the only effective means, long-term, of ameliorating China's human rights performance was through a policy of global, regional and national engagement of China. He did not always get it rightânone of us doâbut his contribution was of great note. He gave his commitment to China practical effect through, as noted by other speakers, his chairmanship of the government's policy committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade, his chairmanship of the friendship group, his leadership of many delegations to China and his gracious hosting of many Chinese delegations here.</para><para>He grasped one thing in particular that I would like to make note of hereâthat is, for those of us who are concerned about China's long-term democratisation, the central potential role of the National People's Congress of China, China's parliament. He saw it, in his many conversations with me, as a potential vehicle for long-term political change in that country, as it has been in many other countries which have undergone political transformation in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. He therefore saw it as front and centre in terms of our responsibilities in this parliament to take our engagements of the NPCC seriouslyâsomething which he reflected in his work here. For that, for his contribution to what is the most important relationship for this country in terms of its long-term foreign policy interests in this region, I would like to pay tribute both at a personal and a professional level.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>26706</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to join my colleagues on both sides of the House in supporting the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister in respect of my colleague and electoral neighbour, Peter Nugent. At the same time, I offer my sincere condolences to Carol and her family. His passing away early in the morning of Tuesday, 24 April came as a shock to all of us. I know that the people of Aston and supporters of Peter were extremely saddened by his sudden death. I received a phone call at 6.30 that morning from a state colleague which left me in a state of shock for some time. Knowing the fitness regime that Peter put himself through, I should have thought he was one of the last people who would have passed away in the manner that he did.</para></talk.start><para>Many in this House had come to know Peter as a colleague and friend since his election in 1990. I knew Peter for a relatively short timeâsince my preselection in October 1994âbut I have particularly fond memories of my initial encounter with him. As many would know, I won preselection from a sitting member. That does not always endear you to the supporters and friends of the deposed member. But, from the very first day, Peter stretched out his hand of friendship and support. He took me into the confines of his immaculate office and introduced me to his staff. He acquainted me with the office and the procedures of the office and then proceeded to give me some wise counsel on how to go about my campaign. He did so not in a gratuitous fashion but in a fatherly, mentoring type manner. He gave me every encouragement and support where possible. That mentoring role, while less prevalent in later years, nevertheless continued as we represented communities and shared a common borderâareas such as Ringwood, Bayswater, Heathmont and Vermont.</para><para>There are a number of things which I initiated in my electorate on becoming a member which I have taken on from Peter. One of them, which often brought us into contact with each other, was a citizenship award which is given to one student in every school. In my case it is called the Deakin Shield and in Peter's the Aston Shield. He would get up in front of the students and speak with great pride about Tilly Aston and her work. I am sure that in years to come subsequent members for Aston will speak with great fondness about the work of Peter Nugent in his electorate.  </para><para>Causes on which we had similar views included the Scoresby transport corridor, the republic and mandatory sentencing. All of these issues featured prominently in our discussions. Peter often exhibited much more passion on these issues than you would normally find in a member of parliament. I will not go through the various social issues, which have already been spoken about, of which Peter was a champion. One event in particular made me realise where his passion came from. It was when Peter, the member for Chisholm and I attended a meeting of the Whitehorse Friends for Reconciliation as guest speakers. Peter was able to speak with experience, knowledge, integrity and, above all, conviction on issues such as Mabo, stolen children, reconciliation, mandatory sentencing and, of course, the rise of One Nation. He was able to draw on his considerable experience and the friendships he had formed during his days as a shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs.</para><para>Peter was very proud of his time on the shadow front bench. More importantly, he cherished and was proud of the friends he made during that time on the front bench and subsequently during his seven years as the government representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Peter has been described as the social conscience of the Liberal Party. He would be embarrassed at being singled out, but he would be proud to be one of the strong voices within the party on such issues. The partyâthe governmentâis poorer for his passing.</para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister has already referred to Peter's role as a champion of the Scoresby Transport Corridor. I wish to talk about that for a moment, because it was a grassroots electorate issue as opposed to a lot of the national issues which many other members have spoken about. He fought the lonely fight to get the Scoresby Transport Corridor or the eastern ring road built from Ringwood in my electorate to Frankstonâlong before many of us entered parliament. He once said to me at a time when he felt the cause might have been lost, `It probably won't be built in my lifetime as a member of parliament'âsadly prophetic words now; but he did expect its announcement during this parliament. That he passed away three weeks before the Prime Minister's announcement is unfortunately one of those political injustices that often take place. I certainly urge the state government, at a time closer to the construction and at a time when it may not be seen as cheap, political opportunism, to consider honouring Peter's work in getting the Scoresby Transport Corridor built by naming part of that corridor in honour of Peter. I suggest this to Minister Batchelor as not only a way of honouring Peter but, if he wants to look at personal political gain, maybe also a way for Minister Batchelor to redeem his name in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>Peter's passing is such that I will miss his advice and his robust contribution in the party room and at our periodic marginal seats meetings down in Melbourne. Peter's legacy for me is that you have only a short time in this place and you must stand up for what you believe in and, if you do not do that, you will be remembered as someone who stood for nothing. Peter was one of those rare politicians who found a way to balance and accommodate loyalty to the party while being true to his own beliefsâa salient lesson for newcomers such as me. To Carol and to Peter's children and grandchildren, and to his staff, Judy and Sandra: on behalf of the people of Deakin and my family, I offer you my sincerest condolences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>26707</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to associate myself and my partner Dee with these condolences to Carol and Peter's broader family. I got to know Peter and Carol on a delegation trip in 1997. I served with Peter on no parliamentary committees but on the Amnesty International group. Peter was very strong on human rights issues, and I remember the meetings we had on that delegationâespecially to do with refugees from Burma coming into Thailandâand his pointed questions, always sharp and to the point. </para></talk.start><para>That was a long delegation, I remember, and I had the honour of being the deputy leader of that group. Once or twice our leader took ill, and I was thrust into the leadership position. I remember once that it was lateâand I thought Peter was always pretty good with his advice, and it has been mentioned by his colleagues that he was never backward in giving adviceâand it was all getting pretty prickly towards the end of that trip. It was a three-week delegation, and we were in the top end of Thailand. We had hosted a farewell dinner to those who had assisted us and the drivers, and the people from the parliament of Thailand.</para><para>I then suggested, because I was the leader, that we might need some more relaxation and I led the delegation around the corner to a massage area of the town and suggested that we would all do better if we had a good massage and got rid of some of the tensions within us. Of course, Thai massage is where you are massaged with your clothes on, and they can give you some pyjamas to put on. Peter was a pretty intense sort of guy, and I remember us all getting there and lying on the floor on the mats to get pulled around. I remember the squeaks and the cries that came out from everybody in the area. I think we were all very much more relaxed and comfortable when we left that area and went back to our accommodation.</para><para>Peter was a great guy to travel with, along with Carol. His intensity, his belief in what he stood for, was always there and he raised his beliefs with great strength. He fought those battles and, as we have heard today, he fought them within his party room. There is a lot more to being a member of this House than actually sitting on the front bench: there are all those battles that we know about and that we all fight, and evidently Peter fought those battles with great dedication. He was a very decent bloke, and his family can be very, very proud of him, and I wish them all well in the future without him.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>26708</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to briefly add my remarks to the condolence motion and to pass on my regards and Tina's to Carol and the family for the loss of a special man and a loved one in their lives. Peter was a very decent and honourable man, and someone I admired and respected a great deal and learnt a great deal from. He had been around, doing what we do here, much longer than many people here and he taught some of us, particularly in the class of 1996, how to make a contribution.</para></talk.start><para>I particularly want to talk about his role in the party room. I learnt much from Peter about how to put a point and how to exhaust and exercise those internal processesâbecause above all, while he was a very independent thinker, he was a Liberal Party person to his bootstraps. He loved the party and he worked as a great team player and showed all of us that you can make a point and drive home something that you hold dear, within the structures of the party; and he exercised and exhausted those avenues, much to my respect and admiration. I remember the way that he brought about opportunities for all of us to make a contribution. I remember when he encouraged the Prime Minister to conduct a foreign affairs workshop where we did nothing else in a party room meeting but talk about ideas about foreign affairs and to inject that input into the government's agenda. That was another example of Peter's work.</para><para>Many people remember him as an intense, serious character. I have to tell you that I had a date with Peter Nugent for three hours every Tuesday when parliament was sitting. We have heard about the Muppets analogy and the commentary in the parliament. I was actually in Peter's neighbourhood in the party room, and he was an absolutely hysterically funny human being. He was constantly giving us his thoughts and input to that small group that sat around himâthe member for Hindmarsh and the member for North Sydney; we were one seat removed from him in the party roomâand his insights, the clarity of his thinking, his interjections and commentary on what was discussed in the party room showed a man of great intellect and also a man of great humour and someone who was extremely consistent. He was the one who would share with us the irony of someone's remarks in that particular party room meeting and contrast them with those made a number of months earlier. He was the guy that pointed out when there was a vacancy on the front benchâalbeit a regrettable vacancyâand we would caucus to work out who got the brown nose award in those opening remarks in the party room, where praise was being heaped on the leader. We had a great time in the party room. It was a great opportunity to share ideas, and that is where I got to know Peter Nugent. Tina and I did not socialise to any great extent with Carol and him; but just spending that three hours in every party room meeting near him, actually sitting in front of him and taking in his thoughts on things, gave me a terrific insight into some of his thinking. </para><para>I just want to talk briefly, given that the time is limited and there are others that wish to speak. He was the father of Scoresby in this parliament. He has been on that for 10 years and, as the member for Deakin mentioned, that deserves to be recognised. For what it is worth, that high street road overpass has got `Nugent Bridge' written all over it. We need to recognise his 10-year campaign there. It was quite funny. He was on that for a long time, and I think he used to enjoy occasionally winding up a couple of usâthe newer chums on the blockâto go and do all the hackwork and things like that. He was very stoic and statesmanlike, and we would organise a delegation to the Prime Minister. We would get all that organised, and Carol and I would probably tick-tack on timetables and things like that, but we knew that we had to lead with Peter, as the father of Scoresby, and he would be putting that point very wisely. They were good days. And that time on Mother's Day just a few weeks ago was a very special day, and I think that high street road overpass has got `Nugent Bridge' written all over it. He stayed with that issue for 10 years, and I just want to briefly relate that with how humanitarianism was at his soul and heart and with how he respected the individual dignity of all people. He was always there on that subject and he was always being heard on that.</para><para>I think all of us in public life feel that those human rights issues are a part of what we are here to do, but some of us come forward when there is an event that strikes a chord with us or when there is an issue that concerns us. Peter Nugent never left that stage. He never needed a chord to be struck with him. He was always there on that issue. It did not require an event to prompt his input; he was always there. I would say that, for many of us, he was in fact the chord. His comments at times prompted others to come forward and talk about human rights. He was the conscience of many others in that respect, and I admire him greatly for that.</para><para>My final comment is that I share his view that our time in this place is a rare opportunity to do some good for our nation and its people. Peter grasped that opportunity with both hands. He brought to his work the energy and enthusiasm of someone much younger. He brought the wisdom and insight of a travelled and worldly individual, and he brought the courage and drive of an individual of purpose and conviction. Peter Nugent was a good man. I learnt a lot from him. We respect him greatly. He was a member who did a lot of good things for his nation, and he took the opportunity of being a member of parliament very seriously and, boy, he used that time to great effect, and we are going to miss him. Carol, all the best to you and the family for the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>26709</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too rise in support of the Prime Minister's motion of condolence today, and I will be brief in my remarks. Not everyone who enters this place earns the respect of their colleagues on both sides of the House, but Peter Nugent did. Carol and his family listening to the remarks of every speaker here today will learn of course what they have always known about Peter the manâthat he was passionate about issues and that he pursued those issues with great determination, with great commitment and, frequently, with great courage. </para></talk.start><para>I unfortunately did not sit near Peter either in the House or in the party room, so I did not hear a lot of the examples of humour that my colleagues have spoken about, but I was privileged to travel to China on two occasions as part of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. I saw at first hand the determination with which Peter pursued his passion certainly for human rights. I watched as part of that delegation as he pursued in particular the subjects of human rights and the future of Tibet in two meetings with Zhu Rongji. As well as pursuing those subjects with great vigour and great forcefulness, he also did it with a degree of great courtesy. I think that was a lesson to all of the members of that delegation who had not been on a delegation visit before or been part of a parliamentary friendship groupâthat those issues that we do feel passionate about can be dealt with with a degree of courtesy to those we are questioning. In Peter's case, he did it with particularly forensic skill.</para><para>The reputation that Peter has earnedâthat has been spoken about here todayâwent way beyond the boundaries of this place. His other great passion, apart from those issues that many have spoken about, was his electorate of Aston. On the day that the public announcement was made of the very tragic and shock passing of Peter, radio stations 3LO and 3AW in Melbourne both received spontaneous calls from members of his electorate, talking about how they regarded Peter and what he had done for them. Whether or not they were political supporters of his, there was a spontaneous outpouring of gratitude and respect for Peter Nugent the man. What came through was what many speakers have said here todayâthe very decent Peter Nugent, the very committed Peter Nugent and the very determined Peter Nugent. His passing is really felt by everyone in this chamber. His passing is a sad loss for this parliament. To Carol, in particular, and to all of Peter's family, I would like to pass on my respect and my condolences to you. We all miss a very real parliamentarian in the true sense of the word, and we all miss a true friend.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>26710</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to join the other members of the House in expressing my condolences to Carol and the family in the loss of Peter. I have only known Peter since I became the member for Cook in this House 2Â½ years ago. Early in my time here he invited me to join the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I do not know whether he invited me to join because he knew that I shared a number of his views on life or whether he needed the numbers to get certain issues through, but he certainly was an excellent role model. He was, as has been said by others, a man of great passion, integrity and honesty and a man who had a firm belief in those issues which he saw as important in today's world.</para></talk.start><para>The Human Rights Subcommittee have undertaken several studies. The first was in relation to religious freedom and the second was concerned with detention centres. The report on detention centres has just been completed and was due to be sent to him on the Monday he passed away. Since that time we have been working on the report and the subcommittee has met to finalise it. It is an outstanding report and we look forward to its presentation in this parliament. We had planned to work with Peter following the celebrations in Melbourne on the Friday. We were all going to get together and work through it. </para><para>His sense of integrity, compassion and fair play was obvious and his views on human rights were evident on International Human Rights Day in December 1996 when he said:</para><quote><para>The pursuit of human rights is a matter of great importance for Australians. It is one of our defining characteristics, expressed colloquially as the `fair go' philosophy.</para></quote><para>He had a great compassion in listening to people. When we were visiting the detention centres he listened intently to what people had to sayâhe did not hurry them through. He worked us very hard: we left Canberra on one of the visits at 5.45 a.m., flew to Curtin, had three sessions with the 25 detainees in each that lasted for an hour and a half and then we flew to Port Hedland. We had lunch at about 3 o'clock, worked right through and finished at 11 o'clock Sydney time. This continued the following day. His commitment was perhaps a little more than the other members on the committee, but we certainly admired him for it. In fact, when you contrast Peter's contribution with what many of the community think is the role of parliamentarians, I think it is important that we do hold him up as a model. </para><para>I followed him as chairman of the Amnesty International group, where his impact was obvious. I invited him, as Chairman of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group, to meet with the Chairman of the Beijing Olympic Committee bid team, who was coming down to Sydney when I had been asked if I could put together what was the former bid team for Sydney. Even though it was on a Saturday night on the second day of the Olympics, Peter flew up to be with the group and, as you would expect, exemplified the blending of his strong interest in China with his interest in human rights. The Minister for Finance and Administration was also involved in that particular dinner. As we went through the various reasons why Sydney had won the bid, Peter was first to comment, `If you really want to win the bid, think of the human rights dimensions of bringing forward your requirements to the International Olympic Committee.' I was very impressed. Similarly, when we were on a harbour cruiseâand I think that the member for Chifley was there as wellâwith an overseas delegation involved in human rights, we spent about three hours on the boat debating what they were doing in relation to those who were claiming amnesty in other countries and what we could learn from those groups.</para><para>His interest in Aboriginal affairs was strong as well. He made a speech on Aboriginal education and said: </para><quote><para>The thing that we must do, as a nation and as a parliamentâthe lead has to come from the parliamentâis to put aside party political differences in these sorts of areas. Those of us who have worked in indigenous affairs over the last few years have tried to put aside a lot of those party political differences because, as a nation, we have responsibility not to fail our citizens. In so many areas, including Aboriginal education, we have failed them in the past ...</para></quote><para>His speech was so good that I distributed copies of it to a group of young people in our community to show them the intensity of interest that is given within this parliament to the question of indigenous rights. I also joined him on the march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge and witnessed his pride in being involved in the issue.</para><para>He was always concerned about the disadvantaged and human rights. He showed great patience with the various delegations he was involved with. He was a man that certainly took the road less travelled but his character, integrity and honesty remained. Veronica Brady, when she was giving her eulogy at Judith Wright's funeral, said:</para><quote><para>In the long run, history is governed by people with an overarching visionâa vision that gives shape and meaning to life by relating our venture as human beings to the larger destiny of the universe. It has to do with pain as well as joy, with death, with sorrow, with mercy, compassion, forgiveness, with rediscovering community with one another, with the earthâunderstanding that the history which matters is not the history of winners but the history of losers.</para></quote><para>Peter Nugent was such a person.

Peter Nugent gave exceptional service to this parliament, to his constituency of Aston and to the Liberal Party. I suspect that his influence will live on for a very long time. </para></talk.start><para>There seemed to me to be a very common thread through the work of Peter Nugent in his parliamentary lifeâand that is the time during which I knew him. It did not matter whether it was in indigenous affairs, whether it was fighting for human rights, whether indeed it was his engagement with the international community or whether it was fighting for small business and looking after the interests of small business, Peter Nugent was totally committed to providing a voice for those who struggled to be heard in our communities. I think that was the real contribution that Peter made: to make sure that those people were heard. He was totally committed to what he believed in, he was courageous, he was meticulous in attention to detail and he was passionate in what he believed. </para><para>I had the great privilege and pleasure of serving with Peter on the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when he was chair. I also had the privilege of travelling with him on the trip to China that has been mentioned. I will not say any more about that except that Peter was an exceptional leader on those trips. We felt proud of the way he conducted himself, and he was always fair and helpful to members of the delegation. We enjoyed the experience immensely. A lot has been said about Peter's relationship with people from China, his commitment to that delegation, and also his commitment to human rights. One of the things I discovered about Peter was that I never found him to be judgmental in any way. He had a great understanding of the tremendous challenge faced by the Chinese government in managing a population of 1.3 billion and also of a history that has been difficult for that country. Although he was extremely strong on the human rights issue and fearless in asking questions on those visits to China, he always maintained a deep respect, which was felt by the Chinese. I know that he was respected by the people in the embassy here and by the Chinese people he had a relationship with overseas. I am sure that he is going to be sadly missed in that role. </para><para>Peter had a sense of humour and a sense of mischief. We heard from the member for Prospect about the famous ping-pong contest. Peter managed to get the ambassador to extend an invitation to the whole Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group to go to the embassy and have this match. We all sucked in our breath when he challenged the ambassador to a game of table tennisâand won. He had that sense of mischief and he really enjoyed that experience. I am sure it went a long way to continuing to build on the friendship with China. In the time I have been here, no-one in this parliament has worked harder than Peter Nugent to build on that relationship between Australia and China.</para><para>I have a great respect for Peter. I will always feel that respect and affection for Peter and Carol, who worked tirelessly together and who were always a great partnership. Peter has left a great legacy; the family can be very proud of his commitment to his work in this place and that he really stood for something. I extend my deep sympathy to Carol, to the family, to Peter's close friends and to his staff. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>26712</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to also support the Prime Minister's motion, which was supported by the Leader of the Opposition and 34 other members from both government and opposition.

Anyone who heard his daughter, Deirdre Morella, at the funeral would have realised the depth of feeling that the family had towards Peter and the fondness and the loss that they feel. Likewise, the words from the Prime Minister, from the member for Kooyong and from Damien Farrell filled out the richness of the life of Peter Nugent. </para></talk.start><para>I first met Peter in 1989 at a preselection for the seat of Aston. It was a curious preselection because the preselectors decided not to proceed to a vote. Notwithstanding that, one candidate there went on to become a member of federal parliament, and still is a member of federal parliament. However, when the preselection was reopened, Peter Nugent's name had been moved from chairman to candidate. He went on to win the preselection, to win and hold the seat, and to demonstrate what a fine local member he was.</para><para>Much has been said about Peter. He was very well organised, he was a man of honour, he was very candid and he was a very decent man. But one of the things that should also be said is that he could be relied upon whenever he was needed. I remember a recent experience with the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when Peter was acting as chairman of the committee. I chair the Defence Subcommittee, and Peter was willing to come along to every meeting and be there for the whole of each meeting to make sure that all procedures were properly observed. </para><para>Much has been made about Peter's commitment to international relations and his work as chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the joint standing committee, his involvement in Amnesty, his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and his interest in China. It is also important to note that he chaired not only the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group but also the Australia-Singapore Parliamentary Friendship Group and the Australia-Malaysia Parliamentary Friendship Group. </para><para>I come back to the importance that Peter placed on his family and repeat the words of the Treasurer: </para><quote><para>In the years to come, theyâ</para></quote><para>his familyâ</para><quote><para>will have the satisfaction, like all those who knew and loved Peter Nugent, that he lived a life of purpose and achievement and he made a difference. </para></quote><para>I too would like to extend my sympathy to Carol and all members of the family.

It begins the largest defence modernisation and upgrade program in over 25 years. It strengthens our borders in the fight against plant and animal disease. It overhauls the operation of our social welfare system. It invests in our health system, in our families, in our natural environment and in our most important resource of allâour people. </para><para>And this Budget will strengthen our economy. Most of all it will cut taxes. Tax cuts will bring benefits to business, investors, the young and, especially, older Australians. </para><para>This Budget will cut taxes next year by over $5 billion. </para><para>And the Budget I present tonight is in surplus for the fifth consecutive yearâa cash surplus of $1.5 billion.</para><para>Over the last five years we have worked hard to secure the nation's finances, first to get the Government to live within its means and then to pay back Labor's debt. At the end of this budget year we will have repaid nearly $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt spree. </para><para>As we pay off those debtsâas we get the debt monkey off our backâwe save on interest payments. Today the Government's interest bill is $4 billion per annum less than it was under Labor. That $4 billion of savings can be invested in better things like health and education. </para><para>Mr Speaker, last year's Budget cut income tax for every Australian taxpayer. It abolished wholesale sales tax and replaced it with GST. Every last dollar of GST has been paid to the State Governments. GST now funds the salaries of their policemen on the beat. It pays the salaries of all the teachers in all the classrooms of all the state education systems.</para><para>If we had not cut income tax last July a worker on average earnings would be paying a top tax rate of 43 cents per dollar today. Tax reform brought that down by a third. Today that worker on average earnings has a top tax rate no higher than 30 cents per dollar.</para><para>And tax reform cut tax on transport. Without tax reform Australia's 75,000 truckies would be paying 27 cents a litre more tax on their diesel pushing up the cost of all transport.</para><para>Without tax reform individuals would be paying twice as much tax on their capital gains as they are required to pay today.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Further Tax Cuts</inline></para><para>And tax reform means that from 1 July taxes can be cut further.</para><para>On 1 July this year the company tax rate will be reduced again this time from 34 to 30 per cent. This will cut tax for business by around $2 billion per year.</para><para>On 1 July this year Financial Institutions Duty (FID) will be abolished. This will benefit the 12 million Australians who are currently taxed when they deposit money in their bank accounts and taxed when they make payments on their credit card and taxed when they make their mortgage payments. The abolition of Financial Institutions Duty will save those individuals and other taxpayers about $1.2 billion per year.</para><para>From 1 July this year state stamp duties on listed shares and other quoted securities will be abolished. They will be abolished because The New Tax System pays the money to the States to abolish them. This will save around $675 million per year for the 5.7 million Australians who hold shares and the seven million Australians who have superannuation funds invested in shares.</para><para>On 1 July this year low income Australians who own shares that pay franked dividends can get a lower tax rate. They can claim a refund of the tax paid on the shares which is over and above their own personal tax. This will save them over $500 million per year in tax.</para><para>On 1 July this year The Simplified Tax System will commence and allow eligible small businesses to do their tax accounting on a cash basis with simpler depreciation and trading stock rules. It will reduce tax payable by small business by over $1 billion in the first three years.</para><para>And tonight, I announce further measures that will reduce taxes for business.</para><para>From midnight tonight registered business will be able to claim full input tax credits on the purchase of motor vehicles. This was to be introduced from 1 July 2002, with an entitlement to half credits from 1 July 2001.</para><para>But the Government has decided to pull this forwardâa tax cut of over $600 million in 2001-02. This measure is taking effect from midnight tonight because the economy can benefit from itâit will stimulate investmentâand because the Budget can afford it.</para><para>As an example, a business that buys a $35,000 car tomorrow will pay $3,200 less in tax than it would have today. A business that buys a large interstate trucking rig with a value of $330,000 would save $30,000 in tax.</para><para>This Budget also provides other tax measures of benefit to business. New capital gains tax concessions will be introduced for listed investment companies.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Tax Cuts for Older Australians</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, tonight I am announcing measures to further cut income tax for older Australians.</para><para>Before the Liberal/National Parties were elected in 1996, older Australians who had saved for their retirement and who did not receive a pension began to pay income tax once their income passed the tax free threshold of $5,400. Self-funded retirees paid more income tax than pensioners even when they had the same income.</para><para>We thought that wasn't fair. So one of the first things this Government did in 1996 was to put the self-funded retiree on an equal tax footing with pensioners. It raised the tax free threshold for older Australians to $11,185, and with the introduction of the New Tax System these thresholds were increased. But tonight I announce that the Government will go much further still. We will lift the low-income aged persons rebate with effect for the current financial yearâthat is, backdated to 1 July 2000.</para><para>The increase I am announcing tonight will mean that in the current financial year qualifying single self-funded retirees and age pensioners will have an effective tax free threshold of $20,000. They will pay no income tax unless their income (including the pension) exceeds that amount.</para><para>The effective tax free threshold for a couple on equal income will be lifted to $32,612. Qualifying couples will pay no income tax until their combined income exceeds that amount.</para><para>In addition, the Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will be lifted from last year's rate of $13,550 to $20,000, so a senior Australian pays no tax and no Medicare levy until he or she earns above that amount.</para><para>The combined effect of these measures and tax reform means that a senior Australian on an income of $20,000 last year paid tax of $2,688. This year they will pay nothing. Senior couples on $20,000 each last year paid tax of $6,140. This year they will pay tax of $2,179âa combined tax cut of $3,960, over $75 per week.</para><para>Because these measures are to apply to the current financial year, eligible senior Australians will receive the benefit of these tax cuts by way of a tax refund as soon as they lodge this year's income tax return.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Acknowledging Older Australians</inline></para><para>Mr Speaker, the tax cuts I have announced will benefit self-funded retirees and age pensioners with additional income.</para><para>I want to now announce a benefit for those on the full or part age pension. The Government has previously legislated to fix the age pension at 25 per cent of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. On 1 July last year it increased the pension by four per cent and is maintaining it at two per cent higher in real terms. But tonight I announce an additional payment for all those who receive income support and are over age pension age, including service pensioners.</para><para>The Government will pay each person who receives a pension or part pension a non-taxable lump sum of $300. After I have finished this Budget speech, the legislation to make this payment will be introduced into the House. If the payment is to be made with the fortnightly pension payment next month it needs to pass the Parliament by Thursday. Any delay by the Opposition will mean that the payment cannot be made next month. There are 2.2 million Australians eligible for this payment of $300.</para><para>The Government is making this payment because the economy can benefit from it, the Budget can afford it this financial year and, most of all, our older Australians deserve it.</para><para>Mr Speaker, back in January 1999 the Government dramatically widened eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. The card enables holders to purchase pharmaceuticals for $3.50 instead of the general rate of $21.90. After 52 prescriptions all other scripts in a calendar year are free. Back in January 1999, the income limit for eligibility for the card was raised from $21,000 to $40,000. Tonight I announce that on 1 July 2001 it will be lifted further, with an income test of $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples. This is expected to extend the card to an additional 50,000 older Australians.</para><para>Further, older Australians who hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will be extended the same concession as pensioners on telephone costs. They will be entitled to a Telephone Allowance of $17.20 per quarter from September. The Commonwealth will also open negotiations with the states with a view to extending other pensioner concessions to Health Card holders over time. </para><para>For the first time the Government will also introduce twice a year indexation for those on Commonwealth superannuation pensions from 1 January 2002. This will assist those on such pensions to keep up with the cost of living.</para><para>In recognition of the unique circumstances of their captivity, the Government will make a one-off, non-taxable payment of $25,000 to former Australian Prisoners of War of the Japanese. It will also be paid to civilian internees and detainees of the Japanese. For those who are no longer alive, payments will be made to their surviving spouses.</para><para>Similar compensation has been made by the Governments in Britain, Canada and New Zealand to Prisoners of War of the Japanese. The Parliament will be asked to appropriate this sum before 30 June. No amount of compensation will ever make up for the pain and the loss these people suffered. But our nation should make a statement of recognition and thanks.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Australians Working Together</inline></para><para>This Government has begun a whole new approach to welfare and work. We have introduced mutual obligation: the obligation of the community to help those not in work and the obligation of those not in work to contribute to the community.</para><para>This has led to the very successful Work for the Dole program, where eligible people on benefits put back into the community and receive the chance to do useful work which will improve their skills and help them re-enter the workforce.</para><para>In this Budget the Government is making a substantial investment of $1.7 billion over 4 years to improve the way our income support system works. The object is to help those of working age move from welfare to work and to give them assistance to do so.</para><para>Even though employment opportunities have improved greatly in the last 5 years, we don't want people to be left behind. We don't want people to drop out of looking for work and we don't want the system to discourage participation in the work force. The package of measures called Australians Working Together balances these objectives. It has major new incentives to take up work and reasonable requirements for people to take the opportunities on offer.</para><para>The new assistance includes over $700 million to help people find jobsâmore places for Job Search Training and more places in Work for the Dole. Training Credits of $800 will be introduced for people who do Work for the Dole and community work. They can use these credits to pay for training which will qualify them for better jobs. Importantly, more assistance will be provided for people over 50 who are out of work and want to re-enter the work force.</para><para>A new Working Credit initiative will be introduced to allow those out of work the right to accumulate up to $1,000 of earnings without losing income support. This removes a disincentive to take intermittent jobs or short-term work which could open the door for them to get long-term employment.</para><para>New requirements will be introduced to standardise arrangements for all job seekers aged up to 49. From July 2002, those not in work will receive Job Search Training after three months unemployment at the latest and will be required after six months to do community work, study or some other activity, which for those aged up to age 39 can be Work for the Dole. Parents on income support will be helped to prepare for a return to the work force as their children approach teenage years through annual interviews with Personal Advisers. From July 2003 parents whose youngest child is in high school will be required to do six hours a week of community work, part-time paid work, study or training if they are receiving parenting payment.</para><para>Australians Working Together will deliver the right balance of assistance, incentives and obligations to help all Australians move forward. It will be a major overhaul of our income support system. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Strengthening Australia's Health System</inline></para><para>This Budget aims to improve the health and medical care of Australian families. With an additional $900 million we are enhancing Medicare, increasing health services in rural and regional Australia and introducing 5 initiatives to treat common health problems that affect Australian families.</para><para>The Government is committed to maintaining and improving Medicare for the benefit of all Australians. In this Budget the Government is increasing rebates for GP services, in particular for longer consultations, which will assist the treatment of complex and chronic conditions.</para><para>Second, the Government is taking direct practical measures to boost health services in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>We will be providing $104 million over four years to assist GPs in rural Australia to employ practice nurses. Practice nurses can support GPs by providing a range of medical services, managing chronic disease treatment, doing health assessments and providing clinical support on minor surgery. </para><para>We will fund 100 Rural Nursing scholarships of $10,000 per year. This will educate rural students at a rural campus, because rural students are more likely to end up serving patients in rural and regional Australia. An additional ten scholarships will be provided for indigenous students or Aboriginal health workers to undertake nursing education.</para><para>Third, this Budget introduces 5 initiatives to address health problems which affect Australian families. It targets treatments for asthma, mental health, diabetes, cervical cancer and alcohol education and rehabilitation.</para><para>Asthma affects over two million Australians, including one in four primary school children and one in seven teenagers. The Government will establish a 3 stage program for GPs to intervene early to diagnose asthma, develop a care plan and review that plan with the patient. If we treat asthma early we can minimise the risk of hospitalisation for sufferers, particularly for children. </para><para>The Government will allocate $120 million over four years to improve the quality of care given by general practitioners to those suffering a mental illness. This will help them and the families who suffer with them. It will be used to educate and train GPs on mental health issues and will provide support for GPs to deliver quality mental health care. </para><para>Amongst Australians over 25, 3 in 100 have diabetes and know it, 3 have it and don't know it and another 16 are likely to develop it later in life. This Budget introduces a world-class National Diabetes Program which will provide incentive payments to GPs to improve the diagnosis and management of people with diabetes. </para><para>A new program will be introduced to increase screening for cervical cancer among high risk women. General practices which reach overall screening targets will receive additional funding. This is designed to identify problems early and reduce risks before it is too late.</para><para>The Government will also provide $115 million over four years for a new Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. This will help prevent alcohol and other substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is a problem that causes suffering in many families, and the Government's new measures are designed to address it.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Building Australia's Resources</inline></para><para>In January this year the Government released an Innovation Action Plan for the future called Backing Australia's Ability. </para><para>It is a plan to build Australia's human resources, to support university research infrastructure, to invest in major national research facilities and to finance the establishment of world-class centres of excellence in biotechnology and in information and communications technology.</para><para>Backing Australia's Ability will encourage R&amp;D and commercialisation of new ideas. Backing Australia's Ability added 5,500 targeted university places over four years and tonight I announce that the Government will in addition, fund up to 1,800 undergraduate student places in regional higher education institutions from 2002. This will increase access and participation in higher education for regional Australia. </para><para>In November last year the Government announced additional funding of $1.6 billion over five years to rebuild Australia's road network. The majority of the funding ($1.2 billion) is being distributed to local councils to build local roads. The remainder is being spent on the National Highway and Roads of National Importance such as the Scoresby Freeway in outer Melbourne. This investment in roads is building Australia's infrastructure.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Safeguarding Australia's Natural Environment</inline></para><para>It is vital that we conserve our environment and natural resources.</para><para>Environmental degradation poses a long-term threat to our quality of life, the quality of future water supplies, and the fragile environment we share as Australians.</para><para>This Government established Australia's first Natural Heritage Trust of $1 billion. Tonight I announce that the Government will invest a new $1 billion to extend the Natural Heritage Trust by five years to 2006-07.</para><para>This Trust is the largest ever Government investment in Australia's natural environment.</para><para>It provides a long-term and comprehensive approach to the conservation of Australia's land, vegetation, biodiversity, coasts and oceans.</para><para>This new investment builds on the $700 million provided over seven years for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality announced in October 2000.

We must help them to stay that way. We must protect our country from the risk of plant and animal disease.</para><para>Tonight I announce a dramatic upgrade in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, Australia Post and airports to strengthen Australia's quarantine protection against foot and mouth disease and other risks to our environment and agriculture. An additional $593 million over five years will be used to increase the inspection of mail and cargo entering Australia. We will increase the inspection of passengers and their baggage so that all passengers from all countries that could bring this disease have their baggage inspected. We will work to minimise undue delays for passengers arriving in Australia but we think these steps are necessary.</para><para>To meet these necessary costs, the Government has decided to increase the Passenger Movement Charge by $8 to $38 and to continue the policy of full cost recovery for Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and Australian Customs Service programs involving cargo and seaports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Building Australia's Defence</inline></para><para>Protecting our borders against plant and animal disease is important. One of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the defence of the nation and national security.</para><para>In my last Budget I reported on the outcome of Australia's contribution to peace and security for the people of East Timor. With that experience behind us, and an appreciation of how quickly events can unfold and the uncertainty in our immediate region, the Government commissioned the most specific and detailed defence plan put together in the last three decades.</para><para>After reviewing that plan, we have budgeted for the largest and most comprehensive investment in our defence capabilities for any Australian government in peacetime. Additional funds totalling $27.6 billion are planned over the next ten years in addition to previous budgeted funding. This will allow major capital investment projects including the purchase of Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft, the upgrading of the Collins class submarines to high level capability and an increase in the capacity of land forces through the maintenance of six battalion groups. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economic Outlook</inline></para><para>The Australian economy is forecast to strengthen in the year ahead, with a rebound in growth to around 3Â¼ per cent in 2001-02 reflecting sound fundamentals and the ongoing benefits of reform.</para><para>Following a very sharp downturn in the second half of 2000 residential construction, aided by the First Home Owners Scheme and low interest rates, is expected to contribute strongly to growth in 2001-02. Growth will be supported by household consumption, business investment and net exports.</para><para>The average unemployment rate is forecast at 7 per cent in 2001-02, which is around current levels. Unemployment has substantially fallen under the Liberal-National Government with over 820,000 jobs created over the last five years.</para><para>In addition, inflation is expected to decline as the one-off increase in price levels caused by tax changes washes out of the index. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP will remain well below its average level of the last decade.</para><para>Australia's growth performance over the second half of the 1990s has been exceptionally strong. And our policy of economic responsibility, budget balance and debt repayment has kept interest rates low.</para><para>High interest rates turn the dream of home ownership into a nightmare. Nothing helps Australian families more than cutting their largest bill, their monthly mortgage payment.</para><para>When the Government was elected the home mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent. Today it is 6.8 per cent. A family on an average mortgage of $100,000 has had their interest payments cut by over $300 a month.</para><para>A return of the failed policy which brought the high interest rates of the past would be paid by every family, every month, on every mortgage payment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Concluding Comments</inline></para><para>The first Commonwealth Budget was delivered by Sir George Turner 100 years ago.

It is good advice today. We are still in the early stages of our career as a nation. We are still young. We are still building in defence, in welfare reform, in tax reform, in innovation, in agriculture, and building health care to help our families.

The committee, having considered the draft budget estimates for 2001-02 submitted by the Auditor-General is able to advise parliament that it is satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997. The estimates specifically refer to the provision of assurance audit services, performance audit services and information services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The budget allocation the ANAO is seeking for 2001-02 is $50.126 million, determined in accordance with the outputs-outcomes budget framework. This represents a $530,000 increase over the previous year's budget allocation and a budget saving in real terms of $1 million. Annual financial projections, based on known parameters, indicate that the ANAO should also be able to return $1 million to the budget in 2002-03 and 2003-04. The Auditor-General told the committee that the ANAO's current financial position was sound. The ANAO has sufficient assets to meet short and long-term obligations in relation to employee entitlements and the replacement of non-current assets.</para><para>The Audit Office will continue its staff recruitment campaign, enhance its knowledge management capabilities, and continue to implement a range of work force planning initiatives. The recruitment and replacement of appropriately skilled staff continue to represent a significant management challenge for the office. The ANAO also expects to decide the outcome of the market testing of its corporate services functions by mid-2001. The ANAO has implemented a new risk based financial audit methodology and embarked on a knowledge management program. Both initiatives will enhance the ANAO's ability to operate more efficiently by reducing audit costs and to transfer knowledge and expertise through audit products and services. </para><para>As a result of achieving ongoing efficiencies and changes in business practices, the ANAO has sufficient cash reserves to meet the accumulated cost of existing liabilities for employee entitlements and to manage the recently negotiated certified agreement. Projected business requirements for 2001-02 include the funding of a modest increase in audit capacity, and an increase in ANAO's capacity to better meet the needs of parliamentary committees and individual parliamentarians. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in line with its statutory responsibilities as the audit committee of the parliament, will continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor-General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests.

Any reports of the effect of the FHOS on first home buyer activity should be treated with caution because of the short duration since the introduction of the FHOS.</para><para>(4)	This information is not available.</para><para>(5)	To assist the building industry, the Government has doubled the original $7000 First Home Owners Scheme grant to $14,000 for first home owners who enter into contracts between 9 March 2001 and 31 December 2001 inclusive to build or purchase new but previously unoccupied homes. This measure, together with recent reductions in interest rates, will stimulate the building sector, including many small businesses, which of course will have flow on benefits to other parts of the economy.</para><para>(6)	Yes it is consistent; income tax cuts more than compensate for these increases when considered in a longer time frame. Further, under the GST transitional arrangements, GST only applies to the value of work done from 1 July 2000 onwards.</para><para>(7)	The Government has already provided concessional treatment to the construction industry, including construction of residential housing, in the GST transition. The transition rules contain special provisions for construction projects which ensure that they are taxed only on the value of work done after 1 July 2000. In contrast, the general `time of supply' rules in the GST law would tax the full value of the goods supplied to a person from 1 July 2000 at the time those goods are made available to the recipient.</para><para>In addition, the GST applies to contracts entered into after the GST legislation became public on 2 December 1998. It is reasonable to expect that people entering into a construction contract after that date would consider the possibility of the actual construction spanning the introduction of the GST. The GST only applies to contracts entered into before 2 December 1998 if the contracts include a provision allowing the price to be reviewed to take account of the GST. Furthermore, builders benefit from the removal of wholesale sales tax from many products used in the construction of houses and other property.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Sports Medal</title><page.no>26732</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2190)</subtitle><id.no>2190</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26732</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Burke</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 29 November 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many recipients of the Australian Sports Medal reside in the electoral divisions of (a) Chisholm, (b) Deakin, (c) Casey, (d) Menzies and (e) Aston.</para><para>(2)	What are the names of recipients in the electoral division of Chisholm.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26732</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I am advised by my department as follows:</para><para>(1) and (2)	This information is not available on an electorate basis.

The Home Secretary, Jack Straw, provided a parliamentary answer on 28 February which laid a draft order under section 123 (4) of the Terrorism Act 2000 recommending to Parliament that the LTTE and 20 other organisations be added to the list of proscribed organisations in schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act. The draft order is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of the British Parliament. There will therefore be debate in both houses on the Home Secretary's recommendations.

The following is the publicly available text which UK parliamentarians have available to assist their consideration of the draft order to proscribe the LTTE. As such, it constitutes the grounds upon which the LTTE have been nominated under the Act to be a proscribed organisation. </para><para>â Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)</para><para>Aims: The LTTE is a terrorist group fighting for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.</para><para>History: The LTTE has been fighting since 1983. More than 60,000 people on all sides have been killed in the conflict.</para><para>Attacks: The LTTE have mounted both a military assault and a terrorist campaign, the latter mainly in Colombo. Attacks are mostly targeted against Sri Lankan military and leading politicians using suicide bombers. Attempts to assassinate the Sri Lankan President in late 1999 and early 2000 were attributed to the LTTE by the media and the Sri Lankan authorities.</para><para>Attacks on UK or Western interests: The LTTE has never targeted Western interests directly, though Westerners have been injured as a result of LTTE attacks in Sri Lanka. The LTTE's only attack outside Sri Lanka was the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in response to India's military support for Sri Lanka.</para><para>Representations/Activities in the UK: The LTTE's international secretariat is based in the UK and is responsible for the group's press releases. The UK is also a source of funds for the LTTE.â </para><para>(5)	The Australian Government condemns and abhors the terrorist activities of the LTTE. The suicide bombing campaigns that the LTTE have launched, principally in Colombo, have not only aimed at assassinating Sri Lankan political and military figures, but also have been intended to cause the maximum amount of terror amongst the civilian population.

The documents include the Chief Executive Instructions, procurement manuals and tender and contract templates, Centrelink publications such as âBuying Mattersâ and âBuying Matters Moreâ and CRS Australia's Purchasing and Contracts Policies and Procedures manual and standard offer documentation. The Child Support Agency purchases a wide range of services including office papers from the ATO, which follows the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. In addition to these documents, FaCS agencies have specialist staff who provide advice on all major purchasing activities.</para><para>(3)	The Commonwealth procurement guidelines, which lay down the core procurement principles, make no distinction between the principles in terms of priority. All internal documents and procurement processes within the portfolio give equal weight to each principle. No principle is considered superior to any other.</para><para>(4)	The requirement that agencies must be able to demonstrate that Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers have had a fair opportunity to compete is implemented by Family and Community Services portfolio in three ways. First, by a requirement that ANZ suppliers are not to be discriminated against by the use of inappropriate specification of requirements. Second, by a requirement to give fullest consideration to ANZ goods and services representing value for money. Third, by the use of the Industrial Supplies Office as a source of information on potential ANZ suppliers. This is reflected in portfolio internal documents in accordance with the Commonwealth procurement guidelines.</para><para>(5)	Potential suppliers are generally provided with information about Commonwealth policy on the offering of ANZ goods, as detailed in Commonwealth procurement guidelines.

In addition to encompassing people employed under the Public Service Act 1999 (the Public Service Act) in the Australian Public Service (the APS), the description `Commonwealth employment' also extends to ongoing and non-ongoing employment in non-APS entities in the form of Government Business Enterprises such as Telstra and Australia Post and to elements which have left the APS but which have continued within the Commonwealth such as Health Services Australia and Australian Hearing Services. </para><para>Details of all employment by the Commonwealth Government are not held centrally. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission (PSMPC) collects data on APS employment, but it does not collect data on employment in these non-APS Commonwealth entities, nor does it collect data on casual employment. In relation to APS employment in Tasmania, between 1995/96 and 1998/99 the PSMPC collected data on the number of persons being paid from Tasmanian pay centres. In 1999/2000, the collection method changed to the number of persons physically located in Tasmania. This data is publicly available in the PSMPC's Statistical Bulletin for each of the financial years. The PSMPC does not collect data specifically relating to APS employment in the electoral division of Denison.</para><para>(2)	The specific information sought by the honourable member could only have been obtained by survey of Commonwealth departments and agencies that might employ staff in Tasmania. I was not prepared to authorise the diversion of resources that would have been required to conduct such a survey.</para><para>(3)	In his Question on Notice No.1283, the honourable member asked for information current as at 2 March 1996 and March 2000. APS employment data collected by the PSMPC on the bases described above is available for a range of dates up to June 2000, but 31 March 1996 and 30 June 2000 are the dates closest to the those sought by the honourable member. As at 31 March 1996, the number of on-going APS employees whose pay centre was located in Tasmania was 2,769, which was 2.1 per cent of on-going APS employees at that time. As at 30 June 2000, the number of APS employees physically located in Tasmania was 1721, representing 1.7 percent of on-going APS employees. It is important to note that the difference between the two sets of figures does not necessarily reflect a decline in absolute numbers in Commonwealth employment but rather a change in the statistical methodology. Additionally, and as indicated previously, staff at Health Services Australia and Australian Hearing Services are no longer APS employees although they have remained in Commonwealth employment.</para><para>(4)	Consideration was given and discussions were held on ways to compile the data sought by the honourable member leading to a conclusion that the expense and effort involved could not be justified.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Staffing</title><page.no>26773</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2410)</subtitle><id.no>2410</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26773</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kerr</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 March 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>What will he do to ensure the ongoing availability of staff and resources to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or other administrative agencies given Parliament's rejection of his amalgamation proposal.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26773</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Williams</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The existing tribunals which would have been replaced by the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) will continue to operate as usual.

At that meeting I urged upon my State and Territory colleagues the desirability of adopting a consistent approach to the problem, and that the following elements should be the minimum elements of that response:</para></quote><para>Â·	The mandatory reporting by a legal practitioner to the relevant professional association of his or her bankruptcy; and</para><para>Â·	A mechanism whereby the relevant professional association applies a `fit and proper person' test to the right of a person, once bankrupt, to practise, or to continue to practise, as a barrister.</para><quote><para>At the meeting I proposed that a working group of Commonwealth, State and Territory officials be appointed to develop a response to the problem. This proposal was accepted by my State and Territory colleagues.</para><para>(4)	I am not aware of any such approaches.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations: Vehicle Import Approvals</title><page.no>26776</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2422)</subtitle><id.no>2422</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26776</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 March 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many Vehicle Import Approvals (VIAs) under Regulation 9E of the Motor Vehicle Standards Regulations and paragraph 20(1)(b) of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act have been issued in each of the last five years.</para><para>(2)	How many vehicles were approved under the VIAs, by model and make.</para><para>(3)	How many VIAs in each year were issued to (a) licenced dealers and (b) individuals.</para><para>(4)	What sum does the administration of the VIA approval process cost his Department each year.</para><para>(5)	What procedure is followed and criteria applied when considering a request for a VIA.</para><para>(6)	What steps does his Department take to ensure compliance with the terms of a VIA and what resources have been spent on this process in each of the past five years.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26776</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	VIAs issued under Motor Vehicle Standards Regulation 9E and paragraph 20(1)(b):

It will up to the company to seek a determination following a claim assessment. The Scheme requires payment to be made as soon as practicable after a request is made.</para><para>(5)	Bradmill first approached the Government seeking early payment of its TCF (SIP) Scheme grants in February 2000 to help meet cash-flow difficulties. At a subsequent meeting with the Government in April 2000 the issue was again raised by representatives of Bradmill. On both occasions the company was advised that the TCF (SIP) scheme legislation provided for payment in arrears and therefore the Government was not able to meet Bradmill's request.</para><para>Bradmill contacted the Government on Friday 23 February 2001 before receivers were appointed advising that assistance was required by noon the following Monday 26 February 2001. It was not possible for assistance from TCF (SIP) to be provided within that timeframe.</para><para>(6)	Yes. The Government understands that the potential TCF (SIP) claim from the Bradmill Group is relatively small in relation to the debt due to the creditor which was responsible for the appointment of the Receiver. There has been no suggestion that earlier payment of TCF (SIP) grants would have prevented the appointment of the Receiver.</para><para>(7)	Yes. In line with the self assessment nature of the Scheme, it is the Department's policy that no pre-claim rulings on grant entitlement will be given in relation to any entity. However, to assist in the self assessment process, guidance is available from AusIndustry. Nevertheless, it is up to entities to obtain their own advice if they consider there is doubt about the eligibility of activities or expenditures on which they intend to base their claims. </para><para>(8)	Yes. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Scheme 1999 (TCF (SIP) Scheme) is formulated by the Minister pursuant to section 8 of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Act 1999. Section 34 of the Act provides that the TCF (SIP) Scheme may be varied, but not revoked, in accordance with subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</para><para>(9)	The Government is sympathetic to the difficulties of the company and to providing what assistance it can. The Department of Industry Science and Resources is in contact with the receivers. The focus of these discussions has been on the possibility of providing early access to the SIP scheme.</para><para>The Department's advice is that any early access will make no difference to the decisions of the receivers as to the future of the Bradmill Undare Group. The Receivers have put the Group up for sale either as a whole or as separate parts.</para><para>(10)	The Government has already indicated that it is sympathetic to the situation and will act constructively to assist in this situation. Amendments to the SIP Scheme are being considered with the objective of assisting the Bradmill Group and firms in similar situations.</para><para>The future of Bradmill and its workers, however, depends on the sale of the business and the decisions of its new owners. The Government understands that at least parts of the Bradmill business continue to trade well.</para><para>(11)	The fundamental purpose of the Regional Assistance Programme (RAP) is to generate employment in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia by encouraging local community action to boost business growth and create sustainable jobs. The major element of the programme concerns community-based projects aimed at generating jobs and business growth in local areas with a particular focus on building the skills base of a region.</para><para>The national projects element of the RAP supports projects of national significance and also enables government to respond on a case by case basis to situations such as natural disasters or local economic crises in areas where business closures have a devastating impact on a small, specialised economy.</para><para>Should the Bradmill plant close, the Government would need to consider a full range of options, including potential employment opportunities which might be available in the broader Melbourne labour market.</para><para>(12)	The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, which administers the RAP, is not aware of the `Fact Sheet'.

The Government also introduced the Photovoltaic Rebate Program to provide incentives for home owners and community organisations to install photovoltaic systems to generate electricity for domestic use.  At approximately 50 percent of the capital cost of photovoltaic panels, this more than offsets the cost of the ten percent GST on photovoltaic equipment.</para><para>(b)	The Government does not intend to remove GST from the green power component of domestic electricity charges.  The Government believes that through its reform of the taxation system it has been able to substantially increase the public investment in sustainable energy.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chisholm Electorate: Veteran Pension Recipients</title><page.no>26812</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2489)</subtitle><id.no>2489</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26812</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Burke</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 29 March 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>On most recent data, how many veteran pension recipients reside in the electoral division of Chisholm and the postcode areas of (a) 3128, (b) 3129, (c) 3125, (d) 3127, (e) 3149, (f) 3148, (g) 3147, (h) 3150, (i) 3168, (j) 3166, (k) 3169 and (l) 3151.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26812</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>As at 14 April 2001 the number of pension recipients residing in the electoral division of Chisholm was:

Outsourcing has its origin with the Force Structure Review and the rolling Commercial Support Program, which commenced in the early 1990s. Final implementation and transition of 501 Wing deeper maintenance to contractor support has undergone several delays but is expected to be completed by the end of 2001.</para><para>(2)	Yes. A study, which is reviewing the options for the amalgamation of Tactical Fighter Group and Strike Reconnaissance Group into a single Air Combat Group (ACG), is currently underway. It is most likely that the ACG headquarters would be located at RAAF Williamtown and would result in a reduction in the number of Air Commodores at RAAF Amberley. The study will present its findings later this year with a planned implementation of early 2002.</para><para>(3)	The creation of ACG would enable a more effective air combat (strike/fighter) capability to be achieved and other operational, support and logistics synergies to be realised. This will be particularly important for the new air combat capability to be delivered under Project AIR6000. As detailed in the White Paper, AIR6000 seeks to examine options for acquiring new combat aircraft to replace the F/A-18 and F-111. Although there is considerable effort required to refine the AIR6000 options, including whether a single aircraft type can meet both the strike and fighter roles, a solution which provides for both strike an fighter roles could result in increased combat effectiveness and significant savings. The formation of ACG will allow a range of options to be explored and doctrine to be established. This should ensure a seamless transition to the capability to be delivered by AIR6000.</para><para>(4)	Minimal impact to the base operations and community liaison is expected as a consequence of the proposed ACG reorganisation. RAAF Amberley base operations will not change under the ACG proposal. RAAF Amberley currently has two Air Commodores in residence, Commander Strike Reconnaissance Group (CDRSRG) and Commander Combat Support Group (CDRCSG). Headquarters Combat Support Group relocated to RAAF Amberley in 1999, raising the number of Air Commodores from one to two. Since that time, regional liaison responsibility has become a shared responsibility between CDRSRG and CDRCSG. CDRCSG's community liaison responsibilities are expected to be similar in scope to those of CDRSRG, prior to 1999.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Airborne Early Warning and Control</title><page.no>26815</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2502)</subtitle><id.no>2502</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26815</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ripoll</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Prior to Government decisions based on the recent Defence White Paper, did Project Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) involve an agreement and understanding that Australia would purchase 7 Boeing 737s, 2 of which were to be assembled in Seattle, USA, as prototypes and the remaining 5 aircraft were to be assembled in Australia, in particular at RAAF Base Amberley.</para><para>(2)	Can he confirm the exact number and timing of the Boeing 737s to be assembled, the place of assembly and scope for change to any contractual agreement with Boeing in relation to the AEW&amp;C project. </para><para>(3)	What commitment can he give in relation to his statement in letters to the editor of the Queensland Times on Saturday, 24 March 2001 that the number of aircraft can be varied and that no decision has to be made up to and including 2003.</para><para>(4)	If he is committed to the possibility of increasing the number of aircraft from 4 at present to any other number in the future, can he give details of the actual number and timing of delivery.</para><para>(5)	Are there contractual arrangements with Boeing to accommodate the assembly of AEW&amp;C 737's in Australia should the Government decide to purchase 7 aircraft as originally indicated.</para><para>(6)	Is he aware of the impact reducing the number of AEW&amp;C 737's purchased by Australia will have on the Australian Defence Industry; if so, how will he compensate the Australian Defence Industry for the loss of potential technology and employment development.</para><para>(7)	Will the downsizing of Project Wedgetail from 7 AEW&amp;C aircraft reduce the capacity of the AEW&amp;C system as a recognised defence strategy of Australia's national security.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26816</page.no><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Reith</name><name.id>WI4</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Prior to consideration in the context of the Defence 2000 White Paper, the Commonwealth issued in September 1998 a Request for Tender for the acquisition of six or seven AEW&amp;C aircraft; the actual number being dependant on the overall cost remaining within approved Project funding.

However, with an order of only four aircraft, increased risk, schedule and overall cost related to transitioning the modification activities to Australia for only two aircraft was considered prohibitive, making it more prudent for all four aircraft to be completed in the United States.</para><para>It is currently planned that Wedgetail 737 aircraft A30-01 will be assembled in April/May 2003; A30-02 in November/December 2004; A30-03 in August/September 2005 and A30-04 in April/May 2006.</para><para>Where installation and checkout of mission system equipment will now occur is a commercial decision for Boeing, however, it is understood it will be carried out at the Boeing facility in Wichita, Kansas, USA.</para><para>Should Australia purchase the additional AEW&amp;C aircraft, there is scope for the Government to negotiate to have installation and checkout of the complex AEW&amp;C mission systems in Australia at a location to be decided by Boeing, but most likely in a commercial facility at RAAF Base Amberley.</para><para>(3)	The Defence 2000 White Paper states the possibility of acquiring a further three AEW&amp;C aircraft later in the decade.</para><para>There is an option in the Commonwealth's contract with Boeing that will allow the purchase of these additional aircraft at the originally negotiated price until early 2003.</para><para>After early 2003, additional AEW&amp;C aircraft can still be purchased, but at a price to be negotiated based on the commercial price at the time.</para><para>(4)	The Defence 2000 White Paper states the possibility of acquiring a further three AEW&amp;C aircraft later in the decade. That decision will be taken at the appropriate time. </para><para>(5)	There has never been a contractual arrangement to accommodate the assembly of 737 AEW&amp;C aircraft in Australia. However, should the additional three AEW&amp;C aircraft be acquired, there is scope within the contract to negotiate the installation and checkout of complex AEW&amp;C mission systems in Australia at a location to be decided by Boeing, but most likely in a commercial facility at RAAF Base Amberley.</para><para>(6)	AEW&amp;C Australian industry involvement has always focused on the important areas of technology, through life support and the associated jobs created over the 30 year life of the AEW&amp;C aircraft rather than limited short term objectives. Installation of the AEW&amp;C equipment into only two aircraft in Australia would not have added significantly to achievement of our goals for long-term in-country support.</para><para>Work amounting to about $400 million will still be undertaken by Australian industry including the design and development of some radar, electronic warfare, communications and mission system elements.</para><para>A Strategic Industry Development Activity program with a value in the order of $880 million is also in place and includes high technology activities such as training, skills transfer, collaborative ventures and research and development projects.</para><para>(7)	No. AEW&amp;C aircraft are a very important part of Australia's Defence Strategy. The minimum number of AEW&amp;C aircraft required to establish an effective capability is four, so this is the number the Government has initially ordered as part of the balanced force designed to achieve our National Security goal. The Defence 2000 White Paper also recognises that additional AEW&amp;C aircraft would provide significant advantages provided that they are affordable when the remainder of our investment needs are considered. It is for this reason that the White Paper states the possibility of acquiring a further three aircraft later in the decade.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Customs Service: Property Sale</title><page.no>26817</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2503)</subtitle><id.no>2503</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26817</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kerr</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 3 April 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Have any buildings owned by the Australian Customs Service (ACS) been sold during 2000-2001; if so, will the Minister provide details of (a) the location of any buildings which have been sold, (b) any valuations of market value which were obtained prior to sale, (c) the sale price and (d) if the property was subsequently leased back by the ACS, the details of the subsequent lease agreement.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26817</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Williams</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Australian Customs Service (Customs) has not sold any commercial buildings during 2000-2001.</para><para>During 2000-2001 Customs sold a residence at 12 Ryan Close, Brinsmead, Cairns, Queensland.
