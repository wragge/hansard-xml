And I thank the member for Herbert for his strong advocacy of his own electorate, and we have responded positively to him.</para></talk.start><para>I am delighted to be leading the Australian delegation to the 13th Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum, and I welcome the Papua New Guinea delegation, who are in the House at the moment, led by the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Bart Philemon. We have as a government given a very high priority to our relationship with Papua New Guinea, from building personal relationships through to working very closely with Papua New Guinea on some of its great national challenges.</para><para>We welcome the Morauta government's commitment to economic reform and its re-engagement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We know that economic reform, whilst the right thing to do, is not always the easy thing to do. The Papua New Guinea government has shown great courage in its commitment to reform and has eschewed expediency in the interests of the nation, and that is something that on this side of the House we admire. We also are very pleased to see the commitment of the Papua New Guinea government to reform of its defence force. The downsizing and reorientation of the defence force is going to be, in the end, very much to the benefit of the people of Papua New Guinea.</para><para>The member for Herbert also asked about the Bougainville peace negotiations. Clearly, our discussions today have included already considerable discussion about the peace process in Bougainville. We certainly congratulate the Bougainvilleans and the Papua New Guinea government on the Kokopo agreement of 26 January. That was a major step towards achieving peace in Bougainville. The talks in Townsville, which ended on Sunday night, focused on two aspects of the peace process: weapons disposal and the terms for autonomy for Bougainville. This was the largest gathering of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville leaders, including around 130 ex-combatants, of which there were a number from Francis Ona's group.</para><para>After eight days of intensive negotiations, although there was no final conclusion reached, there was great progress made, particularly on the question of weapons containment and disposal. We are delighted that all of the parties to the Bougainville conflict are committed to the containment of weapons—that is, putting weapons into containers, secured and perhaps administered by the United Nations. This is a very big step forward. Let me just say that the Australian government will continue to do all it can to help the parties as they move towards another round of negotiations in Port Moresby on, I think, 8 and 9 March. </para><para>Lasting peace in Bougainville has been an objective of this government, and we are proud of the role we have been able to play, along with our colleagues across the Tasman in New Zealand, in helping the Papua New Guinea government and the Bougainvilleans move towards peace. Many more people have died in the Bougainville war than have died in Northern Ireland since 1969. It has been a brutal and bloody process, and this government has worked very hard to try to contribute towards the peace process. Today has been a good day in Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. We have built strong personal links with ministers. We have been very pleased with the progress of the Morauta government, and I think Australia and Papua New Guinea can be proud of the very close relationship that they have built up in recent times.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>24466</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The minister's response to that question gives me an opportunity, on behalf of all members of the parliament, to extend a welcome to Mr Philemon and his ministerial colleagues to the floor of the chamber—we are very pleased to have you with us—and also to extend a welcome to those in the Speaker's gallery as delegates to the 13th Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Conference.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline>Hear, hear!</para></interjection></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>24466</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Morgan and Banks Survey</title><page.no>24466</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>24466</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I am also aware of other surveys. Like any person who has been in politics for a long time, I see surveys which cover a wide range of subjects. All I would say about the excitement of the Labor Party about surveys is to remind them that these things tend to ebb and flow. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to make the point that we are behind in the opinion polls at the moment, he is right. I do not think there is any argument about that. Let me say—and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition allows me to do so—that the government remains very proud of the significant improvement to the Australian tax system that has flowed from the introduction of the new taxation system. In so many areas, the Australian economy is stronger and better. Taxation reform is another reason why, when decisions come to be made by the Australian people, they will remember the 17 per cent interest rates, the 11 per cent unemployment and the $80 billion of government debt, which were hallmarks of the last time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition had senior positions in a government in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There is, of course, criticism of one or two aspects of changes that have accompanied the introduction of the new taxation system. One of them relates to the business activity statement; another relates to petrol prices. In anticipation that the opposition might not bother to ask me about petrol prices, let me take the opportunity to say one or two things about them. Everyone is aware that they are painfully high at present. Sensible people are aware that the high price of petrol is due overwhelmingly to the high world price of crude oil. I have been asked on a number of occasions whether the government is willing to make reductions in petrol excise. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition was asked about a windfall at the weekend. The reason why the Leader of the Opposition would not give Laurie Oakes a straight answer is that the Leader of the Opposition knows there is no windfall. </para><para>Let me return to the issue. The government is currently examining whether there is scope to provide what, against the vast increases that have occurred due to world oil prices going up, would be very modest relief. The government is nonetheless examining the scope that might exist for that. We are constrained by the reality that next year's budget position, although still very strong as a result of the reforms and measures taken by this government over the last four or five years, is necessarily not as strong as it is this year because there is going to be a moderation in growth, of which the Treasurer and others have already spoken. We remain willing to examine what scope may exist against the background of those realities But I repeat: when confronted with an opportunity to make a commitment about an alleged windfall, in the words of the person interrogating him—Mr Laurie Oakes—the Leader of the Opposition simply waffled. The reason the Leader of the Opposition waffled is that he knows in his heart there is no windfall.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economy: Growth</title><page.no>24467</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24467</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Treasurer.

It makes me think of a fact which he shared with me when I was in his electorate some weeks ago that, when the government came to office in 1996, unemployment in Western Sydney was 14.9 per cent and that in December last year it was 3.9 per cent. I am not sure whether the member for Parramatta is solely responsible for the drop in unemployment from 14.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent, but members of the House would certainly agree that, being part of a government which has reduced interest rates and created jobs, he has made a stunning contribution in Western Sydney. We congratulate him for it.</para></talk.start><para>The ABS company profit survey for the December quarter was released today, showing that, in seasonally adjusted terms, company profit before income tax, interest and depreciation increased 3.1 per cent in the December quarter. Company profits are now 9.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Growth in company profits before tax reflected increased profits across a number of industries—wholesale trade and retail trade were up 67.7 per cent in the quarter. Similarly, there were strong profits in the mining and construction sectors, the mining sector in particular helped along, one must observe, by its export orientation and a competitive exchange rate. The profit share of total factor income rose to 24.9 per cent in the September quarter of 2000—the highest level on record. That compares with an average under Labor of 22.3 per cent. Company profits, seasonally adjusted, showed good growth. The company profit share is the highest on record. As people know, mortgage interest rates are now as low as they have been in the last 30 years. For example, somebody with a mortgage of $100,000 is, because the interest rate was 10½ per cent when the government came to office and is now 7½ per cent, saving $3,000 per year.

I asked whether there were requests made by the Leader of the Opposition under the act for a costing of his defence policy. Under the act, the requests are not made available to the government—they are provided direct to the department of finance. But we do know that the secretary of the department of finance, under the act, made a number of statements about the fact that he had received requests from the Leader of the Opposition. We also have, and I table the document for the information of honourable members, details of every response by the secretary of Finance to the request lodged by the Leader of the Opposition. In the event that requests are lodged very late and the department of finance has no time to provide a response in any detail, they are still to refer to the requests. So we have on the public record a fairly clear statement of what transpired during the election campaign in respect of costings on the defence side. I can inform the House that five times during the 1998 campaign, Labor submitted envelopes of policies for costings—submarines were deliberately left out of the five requests. I put a simple proposition yesterday and that is that you cannot have two submarines for free. This idea is from the man who gave us a $10.3 billion deficit, who was one of the greatest bunglers in the defence department this country has ever seen and who today has a policy which says to the Australian public, `Two new submarines—you can have them for nix.' This is yet another area where Labor has a policy but they do not have the leadership to actually tell you how they can afford it.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business Tax Reform: Trusts</title><page.no>24468</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>24468</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask the Treasurer: do you recall giving your personal guarantee to deliver the proposal to tax trusts as companies, as part of business tax reform?

The cost of another couple of submarines would be in the vicinity of $1 billion to $1½ billion—probably on the higher side of that, obviously. It is a relevant question because we have a commitment from the opposition for an additional two submarines but we do not have from the opposition any idea of how they may proceed to finance those additional submarines and, obviously, this is a significant amount of expenditure. However, we do have from the Leader of the Opposition a commitment and endorsement of the government's white paper.</para></talk.start><para>In the sense of a bipartisan approach to Defence issues, we obviously welcome the commitment and therefore the certainty ahead for the Defence organisation in terms of what they can do and the equipment that they can purchase. It is a significant commitment the government has made. Over 10 years we are talking about $23½ billion, an increase in defence numbers to 54,000 and of course, as members would be aware, within that there is a program of acquisition, a very important capability for the defence of this country. It is a tremendous white paper and it is good that is endorsed by the opposition.</para><para>But the fact is that today they have a policy, over and above the white paper, which is for two additional submarines. We are entitled to ask how they are going to pay for that because, clearly, one of the options for the Labor Party is to rearrange the priorities which are set out in the white paper. You cannot in one breath say, `We support the white paper and the capability acquisitions contained within it' but in the next breath fail to advise the Australian public how you are going to meet the commitments you have made. If you were to rearrange commitments, for example, in the purchase of maritime capability and if you were to switch that to these additional submarines, you would by and large wipe out the entire maritime capability purchases which we have signalled in the white paper.  </para><para>If it is your policy, your secret policy, to rewrite the priorities established in the white paper perhaps you have decided that you will not pay wages for a couple of years in the Air Force! The only other alternative is that the Labor Party propose, in addition to the white paper commitments, to in fact find another $1½ billion, or thereabouts. I think it is a very fair question.

In the past two decades union membership in Australia has declined from over half to under a quarter of the work force, in part because of the growth of the services sector and in part because of the growth of freedom of choice in the workplace. Unions could respond by trying harder to persuade people of the benefits of union membership or they could try to manipulate the system to establish a compulsory closed shop by the back door or, indeed, a Clayton's closed shop. </para></talk.start><para>Last year it became ACTU policy to impose on non-union members a union levy set at or about the level of union membership fees. These are not service fees; these are compulsory union levies, because in the relevant workplaces workers have no real choice about their bargaining agent and, if they try to make a choice, as BHP workers found, the ACTU goes to court. Thanks to this ACTU policy to levy fees on non-union members, every non-union member in a unionised workplace anywhere in Australia faces a fee of more than $500 a year. Telstra employees in Queensland have already received letters of demand. Workers in more than 400 Victorian workplaces face receiving letters of demand. Ultimately, nearly six million non-union members in Australia face receiving a $500 a year bill from the relevant union. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition says that he wants to take the burdens off struggling Australians.

The Federal Magistrates Service has taken over a large part of the less complex work done in the family law area. In addition, there has been some reduction in the Family Court's budget designed simply to reflect the fact that they no longer pay wholesale sales tax on a lot of supplies. There has been no other reduction in the Family Court budget, so any changes that have occurred in relation to the administration of the court have other reasons.

Our reforms to private health insurance were designed to give people choice and to take some pressure off the public hospital system. I am delighted to be able to inform honourable members that the figures coming through are enormously encouraging. Private health insurance paid for 428,000 admissions to hospitals in the December quarter last year—41,000 more admissions than in the December quarter one year previously. Benefits for the calendar year 2000 were $3.4 billion—a record. In the December quarter alone, payout benefits were $908 million—$110 million more than for the same quarter in 1999. Perhaps some of the best evidence as to the success comes from the annual report of the New South Wales Department of Health. In 1999-2000, admissions to New South Wales public hospitals went down by 36,000 and, at the same time, private hospital admissions increased by 35,000. So you have here a shift from public hospitals—taking some of the pressure off them—to the private hospital system.</para></talk.start><para>It is 156 days since Cathy Freeman won a gold medal in the 400 metres. It was a great night, as honourable members will know. The nation celebrated and it dominated the headlines for days. Something else happened 156 days ago: at a doorstop, Labor released a policy saying that they supported the 30 per cent rebate. This was in spite of the Leader of the Opposition saying in Townsville, less than four weeks previously, `You know, I've never seen so many people sold a pup as have been sold one in this private health insurance scam that's being pursued.' That is exactly the same scam that, less than four weeks later, he purports to support. In that 156 days, we have not had a single press release, we have had nothing on the Labor Party's web site; we have had no elaboration of the policy and no real idea of what the Labor Party is thinking until last night. Last night, we had three of the Labor Party's backbench enlighten us on Labor Party thinking on the 30 per cent rebate. We had the member for Shortland telling the House about the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, saying that the way the government bribed people to join and take private health insurance was a disgrace. We had the member for Throsby saying people had been blackmailed. We had the member for Shortland saying, `Yes, they blackmailed them, bribed them,' and then we had the member for Paterson saying: </para><quote><para>Another point I would like to make today is the gigantic con that has been played upon the Australian community by this government.

We will enjoy being able to inform electors in the electorate of Paterson that their member plans to take this rebate away from them. The fact is that Labor have no idea where they stand on this.

Across all medical services, bulk-billing is more available today than it has ever been. In general practice, it is true that there is one specific problem; that is, for a long time the rebate went up by half the rate of inflation, and this has angered doctors. The reason that it angered doctors is that the government of the day promised that, when they introduced the Practice Incentive Program, they would not change rebates.

This government has given great priority to expanding the opportunities for young people to improve their skills and their knowledge when they leave school, either by going on to TAFE or to university or by taking up new apprenticeships. The government has increased TAFE places by some 270,000 over the last three years. University places have gone up since 1996 by about 29,000 and, of course, new apprenticeships have doubled under the life of this government. Far more young people in Australia today are going on after school to improve their skills and their knowledge than was ever the case under the previous government. We have taken this action in part because the Labor Party, when in power, destroyed youth employment. It halved youth job opportunities. It also neglected TAFEs and apprenticeships.

It is very important to this government that we put emphasis on maintaining viability for aged care homes in rural and regional Australia. For that reason, we pay viability funding for smaller homes. In the last budget, Mr Speaker, you would appreciate that we doubled the amount of money we are spending on viability funding in order that smaller homes may serve those smaller communities. Far from there being the sort of policies that the Labor Party had in place when they were in office, when they neglected rural and regional Australia, when they were found to have left a shortfall of 10,000 places because of their cutbacks, both in additional beds and in capital funding, we have now remedied that by bringing on 22,000 places in the last year. And as I said, in the last round of the 14,000 places, 74 per cent of capital and 44 per cent of places went to rural and regional Australia to ensure that they get their fair, adequate and reasonable access to aged care places when they need them. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Price Rises</title><page.no>24475</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>24475</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation.

Only one of the three is not credible, and I will come to that in a moment. The Lilley Pricewatch was released again in January of this year. It was a January survey, and the survey predictably claimed that prices went up in December and January as a result of the GST. A full six months after the introduction of the GST, it is amazing how the prices went up. The member for Lilley was so outraged about this that he said publicly that he was going to write to me and write to the ACCC for an investigation.

The ACCC came back and provided me with three pieces of advice. Firstly, they pointed out that this survey, unlike other surveys, is in fact comparing apples with oranges. It has a smaller product base covering fewer supermarkets. So, on this occasion, it is not statistically credible. Secondly, of the 29 items surveyed, 28 were food items, which indicates a clear bias in the information and that it is not indicative of a usual supermarket trolley. Finally—and this is the clanger because, as the Leader of the Opposition was so helpfully holding up the newspaper before, the member for Lilley was running around saying, `GST pushing food prices up'; that is what he had on his press release—of the 28 items surveyed, 20 are GST free. Hold it up again: 20 are GST free. Of the 28 items in the survey, 20 are GST free—and the member for Lilley claims that the GST is putting up the prices of food! Again, the Labor Party lacks credibility when it comes to the hard yards of policy. Again, the Leader of the Opposition does no policy homework, does no research, and yet the Labor Party was taken seriously on this matter by some journalist. Some journalist actually printed it, when 20 of the 28 items in the survey were actually GST free.

It shows their total disregard for the health status of Australia's livestock and their disregard for agricultural issues. Foot-and-mouth disease is perhaps the most feared disease in world agriculture, and the outbreak in the UK, coming on top of the BSE and other problems in UK agriculture, is certainly a disaster that is befalling the farmers in that part of the world. Australia has the privilege of having been foot-and-mouth disease free for over 130 years, and we are absolutely determined to maintain that disease free status. It is a highly infectious viral disease. It can affect cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer. </para></talk.start><para>The member for Hinkler asked what Australia is doing to ensure that this disease does not come to Australia. Already, Australia does not allow imports of live cattle, sheep, goats and deer from the United Kingdom and, over recent times with the BSE scare, we have also placed a ban on all other products that are meat related. Therefore, that ban is already in place. However, we have taken a number of other steps to help ensure that there is no risk of this outbreak spreading to Australia. We have taken action to suspend imports of semen and embryos of cattle, deer, sheep and goats. We have revoked all current import permits for these products and we have suspended imports from the UK of any items that could perhaps remotely be possible of bringing foot-and-mouth disease to this country, including things like dairy products and meat extracts.</para><para>The suspension has been backdated to 5 February, so any products on the water from that date will not be allowed into this country. In addition, AQIS staff at airports and other entry points have been alerted to be particularly vigilant in relation to travellers coming to this country from the UK. The outbreak in the UK does seem to be quite serious. It has now spread across a number of counties and also to the Isle of Wight. It is a type O virus strain, which is similar to the type that has been found in recent outbreaks in Taiwan, Japan and Korea. At this stage there is no indication as to whether there are any links between those outbreaks, but it is a highly contagious disease and one which we must always be vigilant to ensure does not enter our country. The government acted promptly as soon as we were advised about this outbreak. Australian farmers will feel for their British counterparts going through a crisis, as they are at the present time, but it makes us all the more determined to maintain our disease-free status in this country and to take whatever action we need to preserve that status.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Job Network: Performance</title><page.no>24479</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>24479</page.no><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KERNOT</name><name.id>XW4</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Employment Services.

This is a classification that we have been building on and will continue to develop so that we provide the services that the unemployed people need when they need them.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Kernot</name></talker><para>—What is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>—The member for Dickson asks, `What is it?'</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Dickson has asked her question.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>—I am not surprised at the question because the bottom line is: you do not understand the Job Network, you do not understand the classification tool, you do not understand Work for the Dole and you do not understand Jobsearch training either.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The minister will address his remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>—I understand, Mr Speaker.

Just to inform the House, as a result of the ministerial forum that we held with Indonesia at the end of last year in Canberra, at the request of the ministers in attendance at that meeting I have led an investment delegation to Indonesia, particularly to Jakarta, in the last couple of weeks. In that delegation we had the representatives of 16 of Australia's largest companies—in fact, representing about $80 billion worth of market capitalisation. Those 16 representatives of those companies also represented $6 billion worth of existing investment in Indonesia. The meetings that were conducted during our visit were certainly very, very successful and whilst we were there those companies announced a further $550 million worth of investment in Indonesia.</para></talk.start><para>I can certainly say that the relationship that we are working on rebuilding with Indonesia is going very, very well. It is interesting to note that Australian exports to Indonesia at the moment stand at $3.74 billion and that two-way trade currently between Australia and Indonesia stands at $7 billion. It is important to note, if we analyse part of that export effort, the importance of what flows to different parts of Australia, particularly to regional Australia. In the year 2000 Australia exported $144 million worth of live cattle to Indonesia, which was up from $17 million in 1998. Interestingly, those exports came out of North Queensland—out of the electorate of Kennedy—out of the electorate of the Northern Territory and out of the electorate of Kalgoorlie, and I am sure those members are very pleased to see those export statistics back on the increase to that level.</para><para>Also in the year 2000, we saw $64 million worth of dairy products exported to Indonesia out of the electorates of Gippsland, Murray, Indi and out of Tasmania, and I am sure that the members representing those areas were very impressed to see those exports increasing to that level; they were only worth $37 million in the 1998 pre-crisis. Last year we saw exports of $86 million worth of passenger motor vehicles to Indonesia alone, which is a significant increase from the level of 1998 when they were only $6.5 million. Of course, they form part of that fantastic effort of the automotive industry last year where they hit a record of $4.2 billion worth of exports overall. Also, out of the electorates of Parkes, Gwydir and Maranoa, we saw $436 million worth of cotton exported to Indonesia. </para><para>These exports, which we have seen dramatically increase in recent years as a result of the efforts of our government in rebuilding the relationship with Indonesia, are helping to sustain thousands of jobs—in fact, over 1.7 million jobs in Australia. That is one in five jobs across Australia and one in four jobs in regional Australia. The sound economic management that we have provided in recent years has provided the platform for these exporters to be successful in our regional markets. Of course, our program of taxation reform has certainly helped Australia's exporters, as we have removed $3½ billion worth of cost burdens off the back of Australia's exporters, allowing them to be more competitive in these markets. That was acknowledged by none other than the member for Fraser, who admitted:</para><quote><para>... the GST ... should be good for exports. ... I'm not a fan of the GST as you might imagine but if there's one thing that's a plus for it, it is that it should slightly help our exporters.</para></quote><para>And that has been borne out with the statistics that we have seen of increasing exports to Indonesia. </para><para>I am not aware of too many alternative policies floating around, about which the member for Grey asked, but we did see something in the last edition of <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline>. I do not know whether we should take a lot of notice of this, but the shadow minister, Senator Cook, says that he would resurrect the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference, which the previous Labor government ran annually. We abolished that because it was a bit of a gabfest; it was held in Melbourne and it did not get in contact with the rest of the exporters across Australia. But it is something that Senator Cook wants to resurrect. We do not know whether we should believe Senator Cook, because he has not been too strong on the policy positions of the Labor Party lately. In the recent estimates meetings in the Senate, Senator Cook was caught out. He was talking about the Board of Taxation, and he said to Mr Smith from the Taxation Office:</para><quote><para>You will not have to worry about this much longer, Mr Smith. We will abolish it.</para></quote><para>...			...			...</para><quote><para>I think such a body is highly suspicious ...</para></quote><para>But he had to come back to the Senate estimates meeting the next day and admit:</para><quote><para>... last night I said that we—that is, the Labor Party—would abolish the Board of Taxation.

Whilst I have always defended the policy of mandatory detention as part of an overall policy designed to protect the integrity of our borders, I have always asserted that the detention regime must be humane. In this context, of major concern to me were the many allegations of child abuse and generally of the treatment of detainees. I was sufficiently concerned about the nature of some of the allegations, particularly those relating to alleged child abuse, that I decided to set up an independent inquiry. I wanted to know whether the procedures for reporting were adequate and whether processes were in place to investigate allegations of abuse, and if defects were found I wanted to know how we could go about remedying them.</para></talk.start><para>I asked Mr Philip Flood AO to investigate, examine and report on the processes in place for identifying, dealing with, reporting on and following up allegations, instances or situations where there is reasonable suspicion of child abuse in immigration detention centres. I asked him to report on how well these processes had been followed in cases during the past year. I particularly asked him to focus on any area where he believed processes and procedures needed to be improved. </para><para>I will be tabling Mr Flood's report today. He has identified areas where things could have been done better and where I am determined they will be done better. I would like to thank him for his thorough and balanced examination of many complex issues involved in immigration detention and for his constructive assessment of what can usefully be done to improve management and conditions. I endorse the overall thrust of his 16 recommendations. I can say today that my department has acted on some, and will quickly implement the majority. In doing so, some aspects will need further examination by my department, including resolution of legal contractual issues, and I have asked that this be done quickly.</para><para>ACM, the contracted service provider, is revising policy instructions on managing child protection issues. Training for detention staff is being reviewed. Cross-cultural training modules are a component of ACM's standard training package. Negotiation of protocols with state authorities involved with immigration detention is a priority for my department. My department's management arrangements in the Woomera, Port Hedland and Curtin centres are being strengthened by the appointment of assistant DIMA business managers. Attention is being focussed on refinements to case management of detainees and performance management of the contract with ACM. There have been significant improvements at the Woomera centre during the last year and plans for further improvements are well advanced. There has also been significant re-engineering of protection visa application processing to expedite the process as far as possible. I will table a detailed commentary on the recommendations. I will come back later to Mr Flood's examination of the many allegations of child abuse that surfaced last year. An important feature of Mr Flood's report is his conclusion that:</para><quote><para>There also needs to be greater understanding of the values and concerns which underlie the policies being managed. The policies give expression to Australia's longstanding and proven compassion and welcome for genuine refugees. Policies also reflect the conviction that Australia has the right to decide who enters Australia.  They also reflect other concerns including maintenance of Australia's high health standards, prudence about the escalating cost of providing accommodation and facilities for unlawful entrants, disapproval of smugglers duping people about entry to Australia and concerns about the attempted manipulation of our compassion by criminals and terrorists. This report also reflects another deeply held Australian value, the abhorrence of abuse of children, indeed of anyone, who is held in a detention centre.</para></quote><para>Mr Flood is in a unique position to make such an assessment. He has had a long and distinguished career, including as a former Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and as a former High Commissioner in London. He is very familiar with the complexities of public policy and administration. His report also recognises the complexities of the international phenomenon confronting the government and my department. We are faced with a global issue—people-smuggling. Populations around the world are on the move. Sophisticated, highly organised criminal networks ply this lucrative and relatively low-risk trade. People-trafficking is estimated to be worth many billions of dollars a year.</para><para>Between 1 December 1999 and 3 January 2001, 3,796 people arrived unlawfully by boat from a number of Middle Eastern countries, more than the combined total of illegal boat arrivals in the previous three years. Who are these clandestine arrivals? Many are genuine refugees—that is a fact. In per capita terms, Australia is one of the most generous refugee and humanitarian settlement countries. We have settled around 600,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants over the last 50 years. But Mr Flood notes that, amongst those who have arrived unlawfully, there are others. Many are former terrorists, senior officers in repressive regimes, people suspected of crimes against humanity, people with criminal records, organisers of people-smuggling rackets, people who have ignored or abandoned protection already available to them elsewhere and people who have been refused migrant visas and then attempt to enter Australia unlawfully. Some destroy their documents to avoid being identified or arrive with fraudulent ones. Some claim a different nationality or to be part of a more vulnerable ethnic group. Some arrive with pre-existing health problems. Some have no legitimate protection claims. </para><para>Mr Flood also notes that many people openly told him that they had paid smugglers $10,000 to $25,000 each to get to Australia. The government's overriding objective in these complex circumstances is to guard the safety and wellbeing of the Australian community, while fulfilling our international obligations by an appropriate response to refugees. Despite what some people say, we cannot tow boats back to sea.</para><para>Australia is spending close to $200 million this financial year in locating, detaining, processing and, where necessary, removing people who arrive unlawfully or work here illegally. From arrival to departure, an unauthorised arrival costs taxpayers an average of $50,000. A day in detention costs an average of $105. But we are not alone. Developed countries spend many billions of dollars assessing the claims of asylum seekers many of whom arrive illegally.</para><para>This government has significantly strengthened Australia's response to the record levels of people arriving illegally. New detention centres will be established in Darwin and Brisbane and older centres, particularly Villawood, will be upgraded. We have improved coastal surveillance capabilities and dramatically increased funding for overseas fraud detection, intelligence and compliance activities. People smugglers are prosecuted, their boats seized and destroyed, and they face penalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $220,000. Overseas information campaigns reinforce the message.</para><para>Unauthorised arrivals determined to be in need of our protection are granted a three-year temporary protection visa and during that time they cannot sponsor their families to Australia. Has it worked? We cannot afford to be complacent, but there are some hopeful signs. The number of unauthorised boat arrivals in July to December 2000 was down by 40 per cent from the same period in 1999. This dispatch box is wood; I touch it because we have not had a boat arrival in February. We may get one month where there has not been a boat arrival. As well as dissuading unauthorised arrivals, prompt return of those not requiring protection disrupts the activities of people smugglers and maintains the integrity of the asylum process. Efforts are ongoing to achieve cooperation on the voluntary and involuntary return of unauthorised arrivals to their country of origin, on readmission of third country nationals to countries of first asylum where they have previously enjoyed protection, and on transit arrangements.</para><para>It was the Labor government in 1992 which introduced mandatory detention for unauthorised arrivals. They had bipartisan support and bipartisan support has continued. I am acutely aware that mandatory detention is tough public policy, but it is an essential element in dealing with the complex dilemmas and challenges confronting us from unauthorised arrivals organised by people smugglers. It is sound policy and, indeed, some other countries also facing this issue are strengthening their approach to detention of unlawful arrivals.</para><para>The length of time people spend in detention is often portrayed simplistically as being a result of processing delays by my department. The complexity of this issue should not be understated. The wellbeing of the Australian public is a critical factor in managing this process. That is why detailed character, medical and identity checking must be undertaken. The recent detection and treatment of six detainees suffering from typhoid in detention centres reinforces the need for Australia's detention policy. Remember also that some destroy their documents and we do not know who they are.</para><para>Mr Flood acknowledges the complex range of factors outside my department's control and, notwithstanding this, the significant improvements in processing times and hence reduced periods in detention. This has come about by considerable extra resources and very substantial re-engineering of protection visa processing—without compromising the integrity of the process. He notes that 80 per cent of protection claims made by boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within 32 weeks and that this had reduced to less than 15 weeks for applications made in late 2000. I must stress that the government expects integrity of the decision making process. Sometimes that may entail extended periods in detention. Mr Flood notes: </para><quote><para>The range of individual circumstances means that there is a wide variation in the periods of detention.</para></quote><para>Nonetheless, since 1 July 2000, over 3,000 people have been released from detention on temporary protection visas.</para><para>The size and complexity of the task does not obviate our obligation to ensure humane treatment of those in detention. In this respect, the Woomera centre continues to attract much comment and has also been a focus of Mr Flood's investigation. Let me set the context. The Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre was established in direct response to unprecedented numbers of boat arrivals in Australia in late 1999. The 1,245 arrivals in November 1999—355 on one boat—and the sustained high numbers in subsequent months were a new phenomenon, unpredicted and unpredictable. Contrast this with 1997-98, when there were only 157 unauthorised boat arrivals. The Port Hedland centre was close to being mothballed in late 1998.</para><para>Why the Woomera site? It is a Commonwealth site and could be developed quickly. It had available infrastructure and expansion capacity. There were a fully functioning hospital and an international standard runway nearby. It was an appropriate response to an emergency situation. It opened in late November 1999, less than a month after I made the announcement of the need for such a facility. Could it have been done faster, better, differently? Mr Flood says:</para><quote><para>The Centre began from almost nothing in November 1999 and held over 1400 people from February to June 2000. The immediate requirements were establishing accommodation, providing meals and setting up basic facilities and amenities. </para></quote><para>That was Mr Flood's comment. He continued:</para><quote><para>It was a significant management achievement for the IRPC at Woomera to have been established so quickly.</para></quote><para>Let us look at the facts. By June 2000, an additional 2,250 beds had been provided at the Woomera and Curtin centres to cope with the unprecedented increase in unauthorised arrivals. The statutory requirement that they be detained until granted a visa or removed from Australia was fulfilled by my department, simultaneously with the management of two safe haven exercises for the Timorese and the people from Kosovo, Y2K preparations and Olympics planning, while also ensuring efficient use of taxpayers' funds. The department was being challenged on many fronts at that time.</para><para>Once basic infrastructure was in place, attention turned more directly to improving amenity and security at the Woomera centre. Most accommodation at the Woomera centre is air-conditioned and there is a range of services including English classes, education for children, medical and counselling services and a range of recreational facilities. All detainees may practise their religion. There are culturally appropriate menus, and detainees participate in menu design and food preparation. If you found an Australian community of 1,000 or fewer that had available the doctors, nurses and the range of educational facilities that we put in place in detention centres, that community would have comparable facilities to what we are offering to people who are, in fact, unlawful arrivals.</para><para>Much has been said of the hostile physical environment in Woomera. Shade structures have already been erected throughout the centre and landscaping is planned with a particular emphasis on screening the centre and improving the overall appearance. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that improvements at Woomera have taken time. As Mr Flood recognised, the Woomera centre has been `both an operational facility and a construction site on a parallel basis for much of its life'. He notes that it took time for ACM to set up an adequate management team and that the centre was handicapped last year by a higher proportion of ACM staff on short-term contracts.  </para><para>I also note with concern that administrative procedures at Woomera could have been better—an issue which both ACM and my department are addressing. Mr Flood refers to a small number of detention officers who have treated detainees inappropriately. Regrettably, there have been some occasions when ACM staff have demonstrated inappropriate attitudes and behaviour. I have made it clear this will not be condoned. I expect unacceptable behaviour or misconduct to be dealt with promptly and firmly. Where there is evidence to bring charges, I expect this to be done also.</para><para>These are all serious matters for ACM and my department and I am pleased that Mr Flood has concluded that issues of concern have been recognised and steps taken to address them. At the same time, we cannot ignore the behaviour of the detainees themselves. The safety of people working in detention centres and of the broader Australian community must also be assured. Criminal actions by detainees—assaults, arson, riots and escapes—cannot and will not be tolerated. Claims that a `veil of secrecy' surrounds immigration detention are simply not true. There are multiple avenues of independent inquiry—the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The media has visited the Woomera and Port Hedland centres. </para><para>Mr Flood's was yet another avenue of independent inquiry. He has made extensive and independent inquiries, focusing particularly on allegations or situations where there was a reasonable suspicion of child abuse during the 12 months to November 2000. I asked him specifically to look at the allegations concerning a 12-year-old boy at Woomera which was of major concern to me and which has received a great deal of media coverage. Allegations of abuse against children—anywhere—are serious. It is essential that they be investigated by competent authorities. The South Australian Family and Youth Services and the South Australian Police found no evidence to substantiate the allegations involving the 12-year-old boy. In fact, the boy and his father were done a grave disservice.</para><para>Mr Flood's inquiry was to ascertain whether such incidents and suspicions were handled appropriately. He has dealt with the allegations in a thorough, even forensic, manner. He did not accept allegations at face value; he spoke at length to people concerned; he examined files; and he visited all centres—and Woomera twice. This, dare I say, stands in stark contrast with much of the public debate, the freely made allegations and gratuitous comments based on hearsay and an unsubstantiated body of so-called `evidence'.</para><para>Mr Flood examined 35 cases. He has concluded that in all but one case allegations or incidents involving a reasonable suspicion of child abuse were handled in accordance with relevant legislation and departmental procedures. At Woomera, though, he says, `A serious incident of possible child abuse and the broad question of policy on child abuse were not properly handled.' He found the case of the 12-year-old boy `a clear situation where the processes set down in legislation and the administrative requirements of DIMA and of ACM instructions were not followed. In large part, the problems were not with the formal agreed processes but that these were not followed.' He states that `ACM agrees with this conclusion.' Child abuse issues and their handling are of major concern—and they have been and continue to be addressed as a top priority. I agree with Mr Flood in his view that the way in which these incidents are handled is nearly as important as preventing them in the first place.</para><para>Today, I am announcing two initiatives. Mr Flood rightly concludes that alternative arrangements for women and children detainees is another highly complex matter. I have asked my department to examine this matter in detail. While there are significant legal and practical issues still to be finally resolved, I am going to trial some different detention arrangements than those which currently exist for women and children with a view to implementing such arrangements on a larger scale if they prove effective. I envisage a small scale trial based on voluntary participation. Before proceeding further, my immediate priority is to seek the views of the Woomera town community. Completion of upgrades to facilities at Villawood and Woomera over the next two to three months will provide further flexibility to respond to the needs of women and children. We will establish an area within the Port Hedland detention centre for recreational use by women and children only. </para><para>Secondly, to assist me in the consideration of these and other detention matters, I am announcing the establishment of an Immigration Detention Advisory Group. Members will have unfettered access to all centres. They will visit centres regularly, obtain first-hand information and advise me on the appropriateness and adequacy of accommodation, facilities and services at immigration detention centres. I am pleased that the group will be chaired by the Hon. John Hodges, a former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Membership of the group includes, Dr Mohammed Taha Alsalami, Mr Paris Aristotle, Air Marshall Ray Funnell AC Rtd, Major-General Warren Glenny AO RFD ED Rtd, Ms Ellen Goodman, the Hon. Gerry Hand and Professor Harry Minas.</para><para>I conclude by again thanking Mr Flood for his valuable contribution to the continuous improvement of immigration detention processes in Australia. I present a copy of my ministerial statement and the <inline font-style="italic">Report of the inquiry into immigration detention procedures</inline> by Philip Flood, together with a document commenting on the Flood report recommendations. I move:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the papers.</para></motion><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams)</inline>—by leave—agreed to:</para><motion><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Bowman speaking for a period not exceeding 23 minutes.</para></motion></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>24488</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Initially the opposition had serious misgivings about the establishment of an internal inquiry to be headed by a former diplomat, assisted by Immigration departmental staff, with limited terms of reference and without any judicial powers. Frankly, we were not expecting too much to come out of this report. We believed that in the final analysis we would be left with a few sanitised pages, possibly a scapegoat and a couple of wishy-washy recommendations. Sometimes, however, there are surprises, especially where the issues and instances that are investigated are of such a serious nature or where the level of mismanagement, lack of communication and absence of accountability are indisputable. The report by Mr Flood is just such a surprise. </para></talk.start><para>As I will outline briefly, his findings, comments, observations and recommendations are a total vindication of the tenacity with which Labor and others pursued this serious matter as allegations of impropriety and mismanagement began to emerge from Australia's detention centres. Looking at parts of his report, on page 28, under the heading `Systemic Problems at Woomera', in paragraph 7.4 Mr Flood said:</para><quote><para>I also received more complaints in respect of the Woomera centre than of any other centre that in the course of 2000 a small proportion of detention officers were treating detainees as if they were criminals, that intimidation and verbal abuse occurred and detainees were not sufficiently aware of their right of complaint to the Ombudsman. </para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Credible witnesses have told me of derogatory remarks to detainees, humiliation of people in room searches and people sworn at in an abusive manner. I am satisfied on the basis of the credibility of these witnesses that these claims are valid. They apply to a small minority of detention officers.</para></quote><para>Nevertheless, a small minority is obviously a significant number of people involved. This is one of the very serious matters which he investigated. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>It appears also that there has been a degree of friction or professional jealousy between detention officers with a correctional background and those recruited specifically to work in detention centres. The latter view some officers with a correctional background as unnecessarily rude and lacking empathy with detainees. In turn some detention officers with a correctional background view other detention officers as being too soft in their dealings with detainees. </para></quote><para>These are quite serious allegations which, to his credit, Mr Flood has flushed out; he has found that there are a lot of problems in these detention centres, particularly at Woomera. I am very pleased that he has brought it to the fore.</para><para>The other particular part of his report which I found to be very telling was on page 36 under the heading `Conclusions and Recommendations'. We must remember that this inquiry was called for by the minister after numerous allegations were made, particularly with respect to the alleged sexual abuse of a 12-year-old boy. Mr Flood says he found allegations, instances or situations where there is a reasonable suspicion of child abuse in a number of detention centres. He said:</para><quote><para>However, I found that at the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre a serious incident of possible child abuse and the broad question of policy on child abuse were not properly handled.</para></quote><para>He goes on to then talk about the fact that there was a nurse's recommendation that the child should be seen by a doctor which was not acted upon, nor was the matter referred to the South Australian Police. Moreover, the interview with the boy was late at night and was not conducted with the Farsi speaking then health services manager at the centre but with a detainee interpreter, contrary to ACM instructions. He goes on to talk about the fact that it was inexcusable that the relevant report by the responsible nurse was not drawn to the attention of FAYS, the South Australian family and youth services authorities, until 20 November 2000. The point is that it was only brought to their attention after media reports continually made the allegations. Let us make no mistake about this: the only reason this inquiry was called was that the press got onto it and people were making allegations.</para><para>In his statement to parliament today the minister asserts that he believes in a humane detention regime for unauthorised arrivals and that he was greatly concerned at the number of allegations of child abuse and the general mistreatment of detainees. I accept that. But it is all very well to indulge in this kind of rhetoric now. These statements are directly contradicted by the stance the minister himself took last year when the allegations began to surface. Unfortunately, as I previously stated, Mr Ruddock had to be dragged, in effect, kicking and screaming into establishing even this limited inquiry which we are discussing today. Without relentless pressure from the press, from the opposition and from human rights organisations, this investigation would never have occurred and these findings would never have seen the light of day. I think that that in itself is the real point that we should be discussing, that, had it not been for the press, these people making these allegations were not going to be taken any notice of whatsoever by this government. Until today, following the stinging criticism set out in the Flood report and its recommendations highlighting a systemic failure to properly manage detainee issues at Woomera, the minister has clung to the belief that by outsourcing immigration detention services he would effectively be able to wash his hands of his responsibility for their administration.</para><para>Time after time, when questioned by the media or in this House, the minister passed the buck and absolved himself and his department from any blame or responsibility. This document from the web site of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs outlines the response that the minister gave to various media questions from 15 November to early December. I will not read all of them; time does not allow us to do that. The web site begins with the claim:</para><quote><para>1. A Young Boy was Raped by his Father and Sold to Other Detainees for Cigarettes ...</para></quote><para>And the response was:</para><quote><para>Police and FAYS are the appropriate authorities.</para></quote><para>Another claim is: </para><quote><para>5. Nurse Forced to Tear Up Initial Report of Alleged Rape of 12-year-old Boy ...</para><para>Source: The Australian 21/11/00 - Journalist: Matthew Spencer Substantively similar to Australian allegations of 15/11/00 ...</para></quote><para>And the response was:</para><quote><para>Nurses, and other detention centre staff, have both a legal and moral obligation to report such incidents without exception.</para></quote><para>It is always somebody else's fault. Another claim reads:</para><quote><para>6. Contracted Staff Wanting to Report Child Abuse were Intimidated into Not Doing So</para><para>Source: The Australian 21/11/00 ...</para></quote><para>The response there is again:</para><quote><para>Staff have both a legal and moral obligation to report - there is no option.</para></quote><para>And it goes on. When these allegations were brought up, the minister was sometimes very fulsome in his praise of Australasian Correctional Management. If he looks now at the report put out by Mr Flood, Mr Flood makes it very, very plain what he thinks the situation in Woomera was.</para><para>The extent of the minister's negligence in his blind faith in Australasian Correctional Management's ability to properly and humanely manage the immigration and detention centres—Woomera in particular—is evident in the set of compelling recommendations handed down by Mr Flood, in the government's total acquiescence to them and in the government's admission of liability by promising to implement almost all of them. In his statement, the minister has undertaken to carry out the following changes to the administration of the detention centres: to revise policy instructions for managing child protection issues; to review training for detention staff; to negotiate protocols between state authorities and DIMA as a matter of priority; to appoint DIMA assistant business managers to strengthen management arrangements at Woomera, Port Hedland and Curtin; to refine case manager practices for detainees; and to focus on the performance management of Australasian Correctional Management.</para><para>On the surface, these are all positive moves by a minister concerned for the humane treatment of those in his care in detention centres. We welcome these belated measures. However, let us look at what the minister does not say in his statement rather than what he says. Let us look at what was not done rather than what will now be implemented. These recommendations are a serious indictment of the government's mismanagement of unauthorised arrivals, its failure to protect those vulnerable to exploitation and possible abuse, and the ultimate priority placed on profit and economic efficiencies by both DIMA and ACM.</para><para>What Philip Flood's recommendations say about the management of Woomera, and arguably other detention centres, is this: to date, the training of ACM officers in detention centres has been thoroughly inadequate. No clear lines of communication existed between DIMA and the relevant police authorities in various states to articulate what role the police should play in any incident on the Commonwealth government facilities. No clear lines of communication existed between state welfare agents and DIMA with respect to the protection and removal of children where their welfare was in danger. No systematic procedures existed for assessing incident reports and assuring appropriate follow-ups. No regular and detailed management information was provided to the minister, DIMA and ACM's management, alerting them of problems within individual centres. The contractual immigration detention standards are in need of review before contract renegotiation. Inadequate DIMA resources were allocated to monitor ACM's performance. Inadequate resources in DIMA's central office were made available to handle workload associated with the recent influx of unauthorised arrivals. ACM did not have clear policies for the protection of detainees' records and privacy and no proactive review of ACM's performance—such as spot audits of specific issues, including the welfare of children, hygiene, health, food, et cetera—existed.</para><para>These are findings of an independent inquiry that has been given very limited terms of reference. Yet, in the report, Mr Flood makes it very clear that there are major problems in these detention centres. So where are we now? Should the minister be congratulated and exonerated from all blame and responsibility simply because he has decided to fix up some of the problems which until today he claimed never existed? We have to remember that Mr Flood was limited by the terms of reference set by the minister—terms of reference that were deliberately narrow and that indeed necessitated that Mr Flood at times ignore them and press further for answers. I want to congratulate him for being prepared to take that initiative. </para><para>If this is the level of mismanagement, opportunism and neglect of procedures uncovered by a limited and narrow investigation which essentially skimmed the surface, what more is there to find? Mr Flood has handed down a good report under the limited parameters that he was provided. His work should now be used as a starting point for a full judicial inquiry to probe the culture of secrecy and profit motivated cover-ups that has sprung up in Australia's immigration detention centres. The sheer volume of allegations that emerged last year was staggering. While Mr Flood was able to speak to and investigate the claims of many of these people, there are many more credible witnesses who will not come forward while their anonymity is at risk. An inquiry is needed where testimony can be compelled, witnesses protected and evidence subpoenaed. The opposition renews yet again its call for a full and independent judicial inquiry to test the veracity of the allegations that were made by credible witnesses who have not come forward and who will not do so, I understand, without protection.</para><para>In conclusion, I make the comment that Labor support the mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals. The minister correctly said that it was Labor in 1992 who brought in the system of mandatory detention. That does not mean that the position of vulnerable people, especially children, should not be looked at more seriously. I welcome what the minister said in his statement with respect to a possible pilot program where women and children are housed in the Woomera community. I do understand that he has to have discussions in that regard. We in the opposition will be looking very closely at how that trial works, and we will base our policy responses on that. I am sure the minister will let me go on that.</para><para>Minister, this report in no way vindicates the stance that you have taken for so long. There are credible witnesses—even Mr Flood accepted that. I am glad you are doing something about this. More needs to be done, because some allegations are pending.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title><type>Matters of Public Importance</type><page.no>24491</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Performance</title><page.no>24491</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Nehl)</inline>—Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Brand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The collapse in public confidence in the Government and the electorate's growing dissatisfaction with its out-of-touch and internally disunited approach to public policy.</para></quote><para>I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places—</inline></para></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>24491</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are in an extraordinary position in this country now. We have in office a government that cannot deliver public policy which it sees itself as sincerely committed to; a government that cannot deliver the fundamental underpinnings of stability that the Australian people demand of government; a government that is so out of touch with the people it has lost all credibility. I am not a big believer in public opinion polls and, when I am invited to comment on them from time to time when they appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> or other newspapers, at doorstops and the like, I am inclined to say, `The only thing that matters is the poll on the day. These are volatile affairs with possibilities of considerable margin for error and all the rest of it.' These are the qualifiers which sensible politicians place on polls, because they are relevant qualifiers. </para></talk.start><para>But sometimes a trend emerges which is so serious it draws comment, and there was one in today's newspaper which does draw comment—and that is, the levels of satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. There is a 28-point gap—that is, a 28-point credibility gap. I have never seen that in the ratings of a Prime Minister, at least not for some very considerable period. Frequently I have seen it in ratings attached to opposition leaders at the state level and opposition leaders generally, although I am pleased to say that I have not experienced one such myself. Nevertheless, it is understandable in that case because, generally speaking, an opposition is not creating policy; it is not creating events, it is not creating facts, if you like. Therefore, opposition leaders are likely to be little known to the general public until such time as they assume office.</para><para>But for a credibility gap to have opened up like that for the Prime Minister is very serious indeed, coming on top of the experience of his political parties in the last couple of state elections, and what seems to be the disillusion of his major coalition partner, the National Party. We have seen the extraordinary difficulties of the National Party leader in this House and his utter humiliation in question time today when, one after another, Liberal ministers of very doubtful value and expertise were obliged to get up and answer questions for him. We need to comprehend this with absolute clarity. The Liberal Party cannot in this country govern except on the basis of a coalition with the National Party. The National Party cannot deliver the fundamental agenda of this government. This government's value to the nation has now ceased, as the Prime Minister's credibility with this nation has now ceased.</para><para>This matter of public importance goes to the core of this government's relationship with the truth. The Prime Minister said recently that prime ministers who do not listen to the people are doomed. That is dead right, but with this Prime Minister we have to go back to a more fundamental point. When you listen to the Australian people today, Prime Minister, I would wager that the first thing that you would hear them say all around the country is, `Don't lie to us.' The people of Australia would love you to listen to them, Prime Minister, but they would love it even more if this misleading of them by you and the government ceased.</para><para>People remember—and these things are now set up in lights, badged permanently on the foreheads of this government—firstly, that there would never ever be a GST. If I have heard that one quoted back to me once by people around this country, I have heard it a thousand times. They remember, secondly, that business red tape would be cut by 50 per cent. That is another badge across the foreheads of this government. They remember, thirdly, that every pensioner would get $1,000 and four per cent compensation for the impact of the GST on pensions. That is badged across the foreheads of this government. They remember, fourthly, that the GST would not push up petrol prices—the GST would have no effect on petrol prices. They remember, fifthly, that no-one would be worse off under the GST, except the tax cheats. Those are five points which have been driven home to the Australian public in quote after quote of the Prime Minister and his myrmidons as they have been out there in the electorate—and every one of them has come back to haunt this government and to register itself in the minds of the average Australian elector as an absolute untruth.</para><para>We had some trouble honing this Prime Minister's record of economy with the truth down to those all-time top five smash hits, but they are there. Let me talk about a few of them. Firstly, petrol. Again in this chamber today the Prime Minister was trying to be pretty cute about the petrol issue. He kept talking about how worried he is about the budget and that the problem is world prices, et cetera. That is not working with the Australian people. Here is why. They were made a promise that the GST would not push up the price of petrol. They understand that there is an international price of petrol which impacts upon domestic prices. They do not need to be lectured on that subject. What infuriates them is that every time they are lectured on that subject there is denial attached to what was an undertaking, given to them solemnly, not that there would never ever be an international impact on the price of petrol but there would never ever be a taxation impact on the price of petrol as a result of the government's taxation changes. </para><para>They know full well that that is exactly what happened. On 1 July, the government began collecting GST of 8.2c per litre on petrol. How much did they cut excise by? By 6.7c. The equation is simple. Petrol taxes were increased at that point of time by 1.5c a litre. And, of course, you can say `and the rest of it'. If you happen to be in the bush and you are paying not, as would then have been the case, 80c or 90c a litre but $1.10, you would say `and the rest of it' as far as that 1.5c is concerned.</para><para>People wanted that promise kept to start with. Then they want some relief from rising fuel excise, particularly since the GST caused that too. When we were in office, we did that eight times. When we had a windfall, we returned that windfall to the Australian people after there had been an upward excise adjustment associated with movements in the international price. It is not a matter of argument; it is a matter of fact. The Prime Minister knows it very well. I see he has his most junior myrmidon out here, the Minister for Employment Services, a delayed entrant to the ministry, who stumbled at the first hurdle and was utterly ignorant in answer to the first genuine question he received. The Prime Minister put this fellow up to defend him, but he, unfortunately for him, is going to be the first victim of the misleading of the Australian people that has taken place.</para><para>And then there is the question of the GST. Let me remind people of the Prime Minister's most florid quotation about the GST apart from the `never ever'. This is what the Prime Minister said at a press conference at this House about this time last year:</para><quote><para>I think that when people see the GST come in, and they see the new tax arrangement, I think they're going to be well satisfied ... in the end the wisdom and the national benefit of this terrific taxation reform will break through, and there will be sun all around us.</para></quote><para>This is the Prime Minister last February. Now let me fast forward to the latest Morgan and Banks survey, which finds 72.4 per cent of people feel that they are worse off because of the GST. Young people, people on low incomes, contractors, the unemployed, small businesses and women are the worst affected. This is a million miles from the Prime Minister's promise that no-one would be worse off under the GST except the tax cheats. Now it turns out that even the tax cheats, such as the millionaire lawyers featured on the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> front page yesterday, will be let off the hook as the government defers its trusts crackdown, presumably for ever.</para><para>Of course, we want to minimise the impact on farming families and small businesses that legitimately use trusts. The Treasurer is in the process of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. He is letting the big end of town off the hook and using small businesses and farmers as covers. If he wants to look at the situation of small businesses and farmers, we are very happy to revisit our agreement. We are very happy to do that. But the trusts measure is about cracking down on the top end of town so they uphold their end of the tax reform bargain and do not get a billion dollar cheerio while struggling Australian families pay this $30 billion behemoth of a GST, which is exactly what is happening now. </para><para>All the tax burden of this tax reform, which has done so much damage to the economy, is being carried by ordinary Australians; those who have been evading tax continue to evade tax, and they are not poor: they are millionaires. We always object when agreements that we sign up to with a government are ratted on. But, in this particular agreement, we are prepared for a reasonable discussion with them. They have walked out of it. They have not walked out on us—forget about us. They have walked out on the ordinary taxpayers in this country who now carry a massive burden.  </para><para>Then we have the question of the pensioners, who have been hardest hit by the GST: flat taxes hit people on low incomes and people on fixed incomes the hardest. Pensioners have already been done in the eye once by the Howard government; they were all promised $1,000 to compensate them for the loss in the value of their savings under the GST. Forty-three per cent of people over 60 got $1 or less. That has sparked outrage from older Australians around the country. </para><para>But the government was not content with that; it decided to slip in a cut to indexation while it was at it. If people had received full indexation or they were to receive full indexation in another couple of weeks from now—just after the Ryan by-election—they would be receiving approximately $8 more if they are single pensioners or $13 more if they are married. These are people who know the value of a dollar. The government cutely claims, `Well, we always told them.' You did not tell them, Mr Prime Minister, in the course of the election campaign. Sure, we grant you, you have told them since. But, when it actually mattered, during the election campaign, you produced a tax booklet that went into every household to explain the full extent of the GST and its compensation measures. For any pensioner picking up that book and reading it, there was no mention of what would happen to them. </para><para>The minister at the table, the new Minister for Employment Services, has a lot of pensioners in his electorate. As a Liberal Party candidate in the last election, he engaged in a deliberate misleading of those constituents and he will pay a penalty. We will make absolutely certain he does when the next election comes round. As with everything else with this government, it is the sleight of hand, the misleading, the under-the-counter arrangements—`Oh, if you look on page 557 of the tax reform package, paragraph 332, placitum (i), in small letters, we said that.' People expect to be dealt with simply and with integrity by the people who lead this nation. </para><para>Then we have the experience of small business—50 per cent better off as far as removal of red tape is concerned. This is the most massive increase in red tape ever experienced by small business in the history of this country. It has ripped away their profitability. It is bankrupting them by the thousands. It is driving them mad in their family life as they have to cope with becoming the government's tax collectors. And the government gets up day after day in this parliament and tells people how well they are doing and how well small business is doing under the operation of this government.</para><para>What is the Prime Minister's answer? The Prime Minister is very like Baldrick in <inline font-style="italic">Black Adder</inline>. He has always got a cunning plan. He is up there saying, `Don't you worry, I have got a plan so cunning you could slap two ears and a tail on it and call it a weasel.' That is what the old Baldrick used to say: `You could call it a weasel.' Well, you could call it a weasel. They have weaseled themselves into every answer that we have provided for them. I am sick of ticking off all the Labor Party policies that they have introduced now to try to get themselves out of trouble: our suggestions on the BAS; they are about to pick up our suggestions on petrol; our suggestions on enrolment benchmark adjustment for public schools; our defence white paper. One after another, the policies of the supposedly policy-free Labor Party are picked up by our political opponents. It will not save them, because of the integrity problem that they have. They will make the changes, but who will believe them? Who will believe that those changes will last one minute beyond the next election were they to win? There is a 28-point gap in the Prime Minister's credibility, but there is a bigger gap in the hearts of Australians who have been so misled and who are now bearing the burden in their standard of living of the consequences of that misleading. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>24494</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition goes to integrity, because that is exactly what I wish to talk about, and his lack of it.

His track record clearly demonstrates that he is not a confident man but a `confidence' man—a man who tricks or defrauds by gaining the confidence of the people and then defrauding them.

These were submarines that could not defend themselves, let alone defend the country. And we, the Australian public—the people in the gallery today—are still paying for them some 11 years later. Hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money was spent on submarines because the Leader of the Opposition, when defence minister, was incapable of delivering the project. When asked in 1987 whether or not there would be a blow-out in the costs, the Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>There will be no more funds for Defence other than those that are being budgeted at the moment.

You go beyond that and you have to ask yourself: if it is such a great project, how is it that we, the Australian public, are going to get two more submarines under Labor Party policy? Good move.

He knows a lot about employment and unemployment because he delivered this country the biggest number of unemployed we have ever had. Over one million Australians had their hopes and aspirations just blown away by the man who would want to be Prime Minister. Yet he stands before us talking about credibility. He also oversaw the worst unemployment figure of more than 11 per cent, yet he sits here and tries to tell us again that he has the answers. But, of course, he left his greatest fraud until last. As the Minister for Finance from 1993 to 1996, he oversaw the decline in our budget where he ran up on the bankcard, the Beazley bankcard, more than $75 billion—that is, $75,000 million that the taxpayers are still paying today. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Yes, this government has addressed it in quite a considerable manner and has reduced it, but the fact is that it was money that did not belong to the Keating government to spend on the Australian public—it belonged to the next generation—but they took it upon themselves to spend it. When confronted at the 1996 election with exactly what was the position of the budget, the Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, looked the Australian people in the eye and said, `The budget is in balance,' when in fact he knew it was $11,000 million in deficit. The Australian public had to endure the effect of the good decisions of the Howard government in 1996 and 1997 to put the budget back into balance so that interest rates could be lowered, so that inflation could be maintained and so that unemployment could come down. That is the legacy of a man who has been in public life in this place for over 17 years. He dudded us on the submarines and he left us without any submarine capability at all. He tells us that we can get two more submarines at no cost—maybe he believes in fairies at the bottom of the garden. We are still paying hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fix the problems that he caused there. He ran our unemployment levels up to 11 per cent and we are still trying to bring them down—although it is great to see that the number of long-term unemployed is at a 10-year low—and, of course, we are still attempting to pay off his black hole. Yet he stands here and tells us that he is a man of credibility and should be given the tiller of this great country.</para><para>Let us have a look at what else they have been promising. He talks about a knowledge nation. What a great aspiration for the Leader of the Opposition. You would think that when given the chance to be a minister of the Crown in the portfolio of Employment, Education and Training you would embrace it. But no, he far from embraced it—he said it was below him and not something that he particularly embraced at all. The fact is that he did not want the portfolio when given direct responsibility. Now he wants the Australian public to believe that he, in fact, wants to embrace a knowledge nation. </para><para>Let us say that he will and he has billions of dollars to do it. Where is the money going to come from? There is never any mention of the money, is there? Don't mention the money! The Labor Party have had a lot to say about the health of this nation. The member for Jagajaga, along with the Leader of the Opposition, went on and on about this `appalling' policy of a 30 per cent rebate. They all go rather quiet in the opposition at this point. After 31 press releases between November 1998 and April 2000—you would think that you would get it right after 31 attempts—of condemning the rebate and of being critical of the rebate, they then embraced it. When did they embrace it? They embraced it during the Olympics or thereabouts, at the time when the public was not focused on it.

Yes, they are going to roll back the GST. They are going to roll it back on caravan dwellers' rent—congratulations for that. What does the caravan industry of Australia have to say about it? In the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> on 18 February, their spokesman, Mr Norton Whitmont, said that this would mean that rents would fall in the short term. However, he went on to say that rents would rise again because caravan park owners would not be able to claim back the GST on the outgoing expenses. Mr Beazley is proposing that residents do not pay any tax but that they do not get the input credits, and that puts rents up. That is the fraud that you are putting upon the caravan park dwellers in this country. You are telling them on the one hand that you will remove a policy that has actually reduced their rents—you are using it as some sort of an excuse to say that this will increase the income take from the taxpayer—when in fact you will reduce the amount of tax taken, you will increase the burden on those who are least able to afford it and you say that you will use this money in order to pay for the promises that you make.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know about the promises of the Labor Party.

The fact is that, where there is good policy, you will not find the Labor Party. Ninety per cent of the public have embraced Work for the Dole. What do the Labor Party say: we do not want it.

When it comes to their small business policy regarding roll-back, we have any number of tax experts and business commentators who will tell you that it is a fundamentally flawed policy. Labor's policy to create more exemptions is probably the single most unpopular policy proposal ever proffered by any political party in this country. What we have seen from the policy-lazy opposition over the past five years is misleading, deceiving, misrepresentation, distortion, misinformation and subterfuge—all at the expense of the Australian voters.

They have had a gutful and they cannot wait to punish the arrogance of this government. Whilst the government at least initially tried to dress up their commitment to rural and regional Australia, their contempt for those of us living in rural and regional Australia quickly became obvious. Who can ever forget John Sharp, when he was regional development minister, stating that there was `no clear constitutional basis for the involvement of the Commonwealth government in regional development'? So they gave up on regional development: they ran up the white flag and said they were interested in regional services.</para><para>Yesterday it was revealed that, whilst the government had said that it would roll out around 500 Rural Transaction Centres over five years, it had in fact only established 19 Rural Transaction Centres. Eighteen months in, that means they have not even achieved one third of the 70 Rural Transaction Centres which they said they would achieve by June 2000. So, even as far as regional services, which is all they say that they are interested in—they say they are not interested in regional development anymore—they have failed badly.</para><para>Who else in the government has a plan for regional Australia? The Treasurer had a plan. His plan was to cut wages in rural and regional Australia. That was his plan, and he seemed pretty convinced it was a good idea. Both the current and the previous Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business thought that the plan for rural and regional Australia would be to allow people who employ less than 15 employees to be able to sack them any time they want. That was their plan for rural and regional Australia. Of course, this has a disproportionate impact on rural Australia, where we have a large number of our employers employing fewer than 15 people. So that was their strategy to make it easier for people to be sacked in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has also got a plan—he has a plan to close a heap of call centres. He is going to move from having 273 call centres in Australia to having 35 call centres. His plan is to privatise Telstra. Those of us who live in rural and regional Australia know how hard it is to get any service at all out of Telstra even as it is, with 51 per cent government ownership. We know that if they are allowed to privatise the rest of Telstra it will be even worse for the people in rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Ross Cameron, the Liberal member for Parramatta, has also got a plan for the people in rural and regional Australia—a plan which is best summed up in this quote of his where he displayed both his lack of appreciation of literature and his basic stupidity. The member for Parramatta was talking about a novel by Steinbeck. Pointing out that this should be the government's approach to matters to do with rural and regional Australia, he said:</para><quote><para>The Grapes of Wrath was about the Oakies who recognised they had to get out of a dust bowl and go to California ...</para></quote><para>I live in rural and regional Australia very proudly, and it is not a dustbowl. That is the contemptuous attitude taken by this government in relation to rural and regional Australia. They are arrogant and they are out of touch, and comments such as this by a Liberal member of parliament really prove that.</para><para>To top it all off, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has also got a plan for rural and regional Australia. His plan is all about deregulating the dairy industry without putting in place any planning for this vital sector and only putting in place $45 million over three years through the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program. I point out that we got $45 million out of the government because of pressure from this side to make them accountable, to make them put something in place for those dairy dependent communities who are at risk of losing substantial amounts of jobs and income as a result of dairy deregulation. This is the shambles of their approach to rural and regional Australia, and it is typical of their arrogance towards rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Perhaps even worse than the chaos that they have created is the lack of process we have seen in their handling of matters to do with regional Australia. It has been a shameful debauching of regional development policy. Why is it that $10 million of federal government money has been provided to the Hunter Advantage Fund after BHP closed the plant there and lost 1,500 jobs? Why is it that $3.6 million of federal money was provided to Eden in New South Wales when their cannery closed? Peter McGauran, the member for Gippsland, and I know that our region has been impacted worse than any other region in Australia through the national competition policy. Why is it that we have not received one cent from the federal government despite repeated approaches? They have said to us that the Commonwealth does not provide money for adjustment packages to regional parts of Australia, despite the obvious evidence to the contrary. Where is the transparency and honesty in this process? Where is the government's serious response to the Productivity Commission report?</para><para>Rural and regional Australia has so much to offer our nation. If only we had a federal government which would back our potential instead of treating country people like idiots. If only we had a government which had evolved—even a little bit—away from the Neanderthal thinking of the National Party. If only we had a government committed to decent public policy for regions instead of one that thinks they can get away with just rolling out the pork-barrel at election time.

If the Labor Party believe that those polls are accurate with regard to election day, then they will surely collapse as they did over the surf-riding of the GST into office. So thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for this MPI.</para><para>The member for McMillan spoke about arrogance. There has never been a more arrogant MPI than that presented by the Labor opposition today. Arrogance is a bit like beauty: it is in the eye of the beholder. And there is more arrogance attached to treating Australian voters like fools than there is in not listening to their message—which we are. The Labor Party are arrogantly dismissing the Australian electorate's desire and demand for policy and for solutions to problems. I hope the Labor Party continue to simply raise issues with no solutions, no answers, no work. Make no mistake: even those people expressing views unfavourable to the government in the polls at present have no illusions about the Labor Party. You are still regarded as policy lazy and indolent, led by a leader without ticker who can only waffle when asked to state clearly and unambiguously a policy position. Look at your backflips on the GST! You have condemned GST; you still promise a roll-back. But you voted for it and you are not going to change it. You are utterly hypocritical on GST.  </para><para>As for Work for the Dole, you have always opposed Work for the Dole, then you do not oppose it, then you do oppose it.

You will not, because the Australian electorate is very demanding in the run-up to an election and during an election campaign on policy issues. If you think the three of you can grandstand, as the member for Shortland did, about people being `blackmailed' into private health insurance and then go out and support the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow cabinet on the policy, you have got another thought coming.

Having run up for most of your 13 years huge budget deficits so that you bequeathed to the incoming coalition government $90 billion of government debt, which we have more than halved by way of repayments, suddenly you say you want surpluses. In fact, you can do everything with a government surplus—you merely assert it, you do not make out your case, you do not prove it, least of all. The Labor Party can only pay for that budget surplus by income tax increases. Let us look at the evidence of the backflips. It is remarkable. On tax reform, just to take one of the Leader of the Opposition's many condemnations of GST, on 23 November 1998 he said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Only the Labor Party is opposed to it.</para></quote><para>Well, they voted for it.

It is not on your web site. There are no statements as to it. All we know is some press transcripts that tell us that the opposition now support it.

Day after day, week after week, they attack the government and the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who repelled them on every occasion with great skill, knowledge and humour. But they nonetheless stated clearly and often that they were totally opposed to the government's funding for non-government schools. And what has happened after running a scare campaign through all of last calendar year? In December last year Labor senators voted to support the passage of the schools funding legislation through the parliament.</para><para>So there you have it.

As most, if not all, members will have read in the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, the House of Representatives shall meet with the Senate at 2 p.m. on 9 May at the Royal Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne. There is, of course, some business to be transacted, involving an introductory address by the President of the Senate, an address by the Governor-General, addresses by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and a concluding address by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. That, of course, does replicate—not in every exact detail naturally—the first meeting of the parliament on 9 May 1901 in the Royal Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne.</para><para>The next day on 10 May in the Legislative Assembly chamber of the Victorian parliament the House will sit again with the business to be transacted at that meeting being a motion to be moved by the Prime Minister, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition and followed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia. That also is a symbolic recreation of the sitting of the Commonwealth parliament in its temporary home at Parliament House, Melbourne.</para><para>The Centenary of Federation year is off to an exciting start. As history dictated, there was a need for a federation parade on 1 January through Sydney, with due deference made to the Centennial Park declaration of the Commonwealth. However, the national spotlight has since moved to the Northern Territory where a commemoration of the 19 February bombing by the Japanese of Darwin 59 years ago—1942—was the highlight of their Centenary of Federation commemorations. </para><para>There is no doubt that, for both of those events, the committees in New South Wales and the Northern Territory did a superb job in organising lasting memories of very important events particular to that state and territory. It will be here in Canberra that the national spotlight will next shine when on 11 March the National Museum of Australia will open. The museum is the flagship of the Federation Fund. On the next day, 12 March, the ACT will have a number of Centenary of Federation events. Then of course it will be Melbourne's turn. But, in all of this, it is not a year for national events only, let alone in our capital cities—instead, right across the length and breadth of Australia, communities have a large number of Centenary of Federation events or programs well under way. In fact, the web site now has several thousand such events posted on it. </para><para>It is a year that belongs to all Australians, wherever they live. It is a year when Australians can take great pride in 100 years of achievement, not least that Australia has been one of only five continuing democracies over that time. It is a chance to take stock of where we are as a society, and of what our hopes and ambitions are for our fellow citizens in the years and decades to come. It is a year of historical importance. It is also important for contemporary Australia and for future Australia. Australians are deeply patriotic, even if they do not show it overtly or nationalistically or even chauvinistically, as do some others around the world. I do not mean this in any derogatory way but the Americans seem to be the exemplar of displaying patriotism. But, scratch the surface, as the Olympics and many of our other great national, sporting and cultural events show, and you will see that Australians love their country and will take any excuse to display it. The Centenary of Federation certainly gives numerous opportunities for Australians to declare afresh their love of Australia.  </para><para>The government has worked with the opposition at all levels and with the states and territories to make sure this is a year of bipartisan involvement so that Australians can feel part of it and take pride in our communities, even as we strive to improve them. We have an independent judiciary, a free media, and a democratically representative democracy. Despite those strengths, which are the envy of many countries throughout the world, we seek always to improve our society so that it is fairer and more just for all. It gives me a great deal of pride, as minister for the Centenary of Federation, to move this motion which will see the Commonwealth parliament play a very important and rightful role in the Centenary of Federation celebrations in Melbourne.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>24507</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports the motion. It is essentially a formal resolution and we will not take long in our support of it. I have one thing I would like to raise with the minister arising from the general comments he made about the Centenary of Federation and its celebration but, before I do that, I want to say that I think it is appropriate that the parliament meet to reflect the original meeting in Melbourne. I know all of my colleagues in Sydney flinch a bit about that, but I think it is appropriate we have that and that it be part of the Centenary of Federation. It is important we do not focus centenary celebrations too much or too exclusively on these grandiloquent occasions and that we do a fair bit with regard to recognising the contribution of ordinary Australians. It is a credit to the committee that there has been quite a bit of that, and I think there should be more. Nevertheless, the parliament should be part of this process; it is an important part of our history. It was the key representative institution that reflected Federation and it ought be reflected in the centenary.</para></talk.start><para>The question I want to ask relates to the minister's comments concerning the opening of the National Museum. I know the member for Farrer has also raised a very important question. The National Museum is in my constituency and I think the opening of it is a very important event and, in my capacity as shadow minister, I welcome it. But I notice that some members on this side, at least, are saying that it does not appear that members have been invited to attend the opening of this event and they would be interested in the opportunity to do so. I raise it with the minister not so that we add any more costs to the process but rather as something the minister might wish to consider. I do not expect that we will need to extend this debate any further. The resolution is only a formal one to establish the procedures by which this sitting might take place, and the opposition supports it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>24507</page.no><name role="metadata">Fischer, Tim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TIM FISCHER</name><name.id>DG4</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to support the motion before the House. I do so, though noting that backbenchers will not be scheduled to speak at this ceremonial sitting. I suppose I should have stayed on as Leader of the National Party a little longer, to this date, and I would have qualified. I note in passing a wonderful agreement that the federal parliament will return to Melbourne for the 100th anniversary sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. As it happens, my great-grandfather Conway Mason was Speaker of the Victorian Parliament at the turn of the century. His photo will be just outside the assembly chamber and I will look forward to renewing my observation of that photo. He was a colourful Speaker. I guess all of us on both sides of the House will have connections, direct and indirect, to the wonderful history of this federal parliament of Australia—100 years old this year in one of the world's five continuing democracies throughout that period. I salute the motion.</para></talk.start><para>The second matter I wish to raise relates directly to the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation and his very focused conduct of events, particularly on I January when I noticed he moved very constructively around the audience at the Centennial Park observation and ceremony, which was, I thought, a very well-balanced, thought-provoking and moving ceremony in the magnificent setting of Centennial Park, just 100 metres from where the Federation of Australia was declared. In the aftermath of that, a constituent from Howlong in my electorate wrote to me with what I thought was a genuine and worthwhile suggestion, that, leaving aside the whole debate over Australia Day and 26 January, the public holiday on New Year's Day should by formal gazettal be named Federation Day. It is already a public holiday right across Australia. Presumably most of the state gazettal notices simply say, `New Year's Day public holiday.' The request from my constituent I think has a lot of merit. My constituent asks that the federal government consider and put to the Council of Australian Governments that 1 January each year be called Federation Day. It is nothing to do with cutting across Australia Day on 26 January or Anzac Day on 25 April but call it by its correct name, Federation Day, formally.  </para><para>I therefore put to the minister that this motion is set in concrete but the other motion is not. This motion provides that a motion will be moved by the Prime Minister, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition and followed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, essentially on the second day, 10 May. It is not unreasonable that that motion have one additional piece of substance attaching to it: the call by the ceremonial sitting of the federal parliament that the parliaments of Australia and the governments of Australia agree to name 1 January Federation Day in a formal way as part of the gazettal of the public holiday each year. I believe that the suggestion from my constituent in Howlong has a lot of merit. I have formally written to the Prime Minister in regard to the substance of the suggestion. I take the additional step here today, in support of the motion clearing the sittings of the federal parliament in Melbourne, to ask that the minister consider incorporation of this suggestion in the actual motion set down for 10 May to be moved by the Prime Minister.</para><para>Finally, in a way which is not meant to be mischievous but is a little, some months ago I raised a point of order on the ceremonial sitting. I am delighted that the warring clerks of the two houses of this parliament have also reached agreement on this sitting proceeding in Melbourne. That was not always the case. It is tremendous that all elements and departments of the parliament, the Speaker and the President are in accord on the right of this federal parliament to have a ceremonial sitting to mark its 100th anniversary in the place where it sat for its first 27 years of existence—a period during which there was optional voting at the federal level, I might add—and have that at the top end of Bourke Street in the capital city of Melbourne. I support the motion before the House and ask the minister to consider and, when convenient, report back on the proposition that 1 January be formally renamed Federation Day.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24508</page.no><id.no>R979</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>24508</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 8 February.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">House of Representatives amendment (4)</inline></para><quote><para>	Part 2, clauses 5 to 9, page 5 (line 2) to page 8 (line 9), omit the Part, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Part 2</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Establishment of the Trust</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">5</inline><inline font-style="italic">  Establishment</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust is established by this section.</para><para>	(2)	The Trust:</para><para>	(a)	is a body corporate with perpetual succession; and</para><para>	(b)	may<inline font-style="italic"></inline>have a common seal; and</para><para>	(c)	may sue and be sued in its corporate name.</para></quote><para>Note:	The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 </inline>applies to the Trust.

Back in 1995 the former government announced that military lands around Sydney Harbour were being vacated by the defence forces and, in accordance with then policy, they would be sold on the open market for the best possible price. To its credit, the then government, in the face of considerable local protest, established a plan of management steering committee for at least the land on Middle Head and Georges Heights. That steering committee proceeded with a great deal of satisfaction and did a great deal of good work until in 1997, I think it was, the state government decided to withdraw its representatives from that committee. We have had a situation of impasse for some time, and in the course of the 1998 federal election this government proposed the establishment of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. There was, as you would expect, a degree of toing and froing. But now, with the passage of this legislation, I think that the trust can get on with its very important work to ensure that these priceless lands are protected forever for the benefit of the people of Sydney and Australia. I certainly look forward to the state government appointing its representatives to the trust in the wake of the passage of this bill.</para><para>I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this long debate: the Independents and minor parties in the Senate, the opposition in the Senate, the various local councils—particularly Mosman Council in my own electorate—and the Headland Preservation Group. As a result of all of this work, frustrating though it has sometimes been to the government, I think we have a better bill and a better outcome for the people of Sydney and Australia.</para><para>Initially, as you would expect, there was a certain amount of mistrust of the intentions of the government and various players in this drama. I am pleased to say that, over the last few months, that mistrust seems to have dissolved and everyone seems to have come to the position that you can `trust the Trust'—that this trust is so constituted that it is an entirely creditable organisation to have in its hands such an important task: the care and control, the management and maintenance of this priceless land. This is very much to the credit of the trust's chairman, Kevin McCann, and the team he has assembled to preside over the development of management plans. I particularly mention one of Australia's foremost conservation architects, Ric Leplastrier, Nick Hollow, and the executive director of the trust, Jeff Baxter.</para><para>May I say that there is much that is done in this House which, naturally, we take very seriously, but which, outside of here, is not much noted and, in the fullness of time, will not be much remembered. But I think that, in 100 years time, people may not remember our names—almost certainly, they will not remember our names—but in this instance they will be grateful for our work and they will enjoy the legacy that we leave them. I commend these amendments to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24521</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with much of what the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has said in that this is indeed a very significant bill, a bill which will be remembered in 100 years. Unfortunately, however, it is also a lost opportunity and, therefore, it is legislation which is flawed and which will have to be revisited down the track. That is because the deal struck between the government and the Democrats allows the federation trust lands to be sold out to private interests. I know that the member for Warringah has been genuine, I must say, in his commitments on the Sydney Harbour foreshore lands which he has the privilege to represent. But I do think that we could have done better on this occasion and we could have done better had we even simply stuck to the commitments that were given by the Prime Minister prior to the 1998 election. </para></talk.start><para>My current concerns for the future of Sydney Harbour revolve around the fact that it is one of the most beautiful natural harbours in the world. We saw during the Olympics coverage on that first morning of the triathlon, immediately, that vision going to the whole world of what a fantastic city it is—I cannot imagine living anywhere else. One of the great things about Sydney Harbour and one of the great things about the creation of green foreshore land that is accessible and available to everyone is that it makes Sydney a more egalitarian city. I represent a seat which, in terms of the natural environment, is not the most beautiful place in Sydney. The Cooks River is hard to compare with Sydney Harbour. The beauty of it is, however, that anyone in my electorate can catch public transport across the harbour and go for that magnificent walk which starts at Bradleys Head. It is a great opportunity and everyone walking along there —whether you are a millionaire or a pensioner—gets the same view.</para><para>That is why issues of public space are very important and cannot be compromised and why I am disappointed—disappointed perhaps in the government, but devastated by the Democrats' sell-out on this issue, because they, who purport to be concerned about these issues, have shown a lack of understanding and a lack of commitment. It is not surprising, perhaps, that they are being rejected around the nation and that the Greens are picking up support which they once had.</para><para>Sydney Harbour, of course, is a unique mix of urban development and largely untouched bushland. I support all the amendments which we pursued in the Senate to this bill, because I believe that they would have saved the harbour and really ended the debate on any further development. The minister is certainly aware of my relationship and proud friendship with Tom Uren, who is the patron of the Defenders of Sydney Harbour Foreshores. Once again, Tom has shown—as someone who would not mind being described as a `leftie', a proud left-wing member of the ALP—his ability to work with people, including the minister and a broad coalition of people in the interests of the nation. A good model, I must say. Tom's submission to the bill really shows up the weaknesses which are there. He said in that submission:</para><quote><para>I have had a love affair with Sydney Harbour and its shores since I was a boy of 13. I commenced employment at that age and travelled daily from our home on the Manly ferry until I was 18. I then joined the army at 18 and for approximately the next two years served in the Royal Australian Artillery of North Head. The deafness in my left ear is due to recording gun elevation of the Mark VII on Middle Head. From North Head I saw the great troop ships of World War II—the <inline font-style="italic">Queen Mary</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Queen Elizabeth</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Aquitania</inline>—sail out through the heads, taking with them the cream of our nationhood to war. So, my friends, the seed of love was sown early in my life for our harbour and its shores.</para><para>The visionary who inspired me most was Niel Nielsen, Minister for Lands in the McGowan government from 1910-11. He was able to acquire, with a land acquisition fund of 150,000 pounds, the park that now carries his name, Strickland House and the Hermitage Reserve. </para><para>His vision was that progressively we should try to create a green belt around the shores of Sydney Harbour. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para></quote><para>The vision that Niel Nielsen had and Tom Uren shares and still pursues is still possible, as long as the Defence lands on the shores of Sydney Harbour remain in public hands. In 1979, Prime Minister Fraser and Premier Wran entered into an agreement and the Commonwealth transferred Dobroyd Point and the North Head shores, including the quarantine station, all the Middle Head shores from HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Penguin</inline> around to Chowder Bay, and the shores and land which are part of South Head, to the New South Wales government. A part of the agreement was that when the Commonwealth no longer needed remaining harbour Defence land, it would also be transferred to New South Wales. However, as is usual with this government, there is always a glitch somewhere. In October 1996, the Howard government announced an outcome, as proposed by a steering committee, that 120 residential sites would be sold to private developers. </para><para>There was then the development, due to the outcry against this proposal in 1997 by the Prime Minister, that the government would rehabilitate Middle Head-Georges Heights land and transfer it to the Sydney Harbour National Park. It could be a gift to the nation as part of the 2001 Centenary of Federation celebrations. The Commonwealth government have a responsibility to rehabilitate Middle Head and Georges Heights. It is good enough for the Commonwealth and state governments to make mining companies rehabilitate their land: the Department of Defence—that is, the Commonwealth—should meet their responsibilities.</para><para>In September 1998 the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The issue of most concern is the stated aim of the trust to finance commercial activities and the redevelopment of parts of the sites. The explanatory memorandum states that the trust must be able to take advantage of economic opportunities, that the intention is that the trust should be financially independent, that some land may be unsuitable for park or community use and sold and, finally, that it is intended that the trust should be self-funding. I think this is inappropriate. One of the concerns that we have is the government's adamant refusal to include Markham Close at Georges Heights in schedule 1 of the act. Had this occurred it would have protected it from sale. The minister would be aware that the existing cottages on the high side of Markham Close already cross the Georges Heights-Middle Head ridge line. If they are sold, there is no doubt the developers would want to build upon what is there and it would potentially further damage the view which people are able to see from there.</para><para>The government has missed an opportunity with this bill to work with all concerned parties and to come up with the best solution. Amendments moved by the ALP and not supported by the Democrats include: preventing the sale of any Sydney Harbour Federation Trust lands; making long-term leases extending beyond the life of the trust subject to parliamentary approval; making the lands subject to state planning and environmental law; changing membership of the trust to include community representation and legitimate indigenous representation; and limiting the transfer of land to New South Wales for inclusion in national park and reserve system only on the condition that it remain in public ownership. The Democrats' position on the environment, on this issue—where their job, according to them, is to keep the government honest—has been, once again, to simply fall over and do the government's bidding, just as they did on the GST.</para><para>Strong protection is needed here because at some point in the future governments under financial constraints will be under pressure to sell land. We have seen on a number of issues relating to Sydney that people who perhaps do not understand the importance of this green space are put under pressure from bureaucrats in the departments of treasury, finance and others to find funds. That is why we need legislation which is much more secure than the legislation which will be carried by this House and that is why the ALP want our opposition to be placed on the record. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>Before the 1998 election, the Prime Minister said of the Sydney Harbour foreshore that it was one of Sydney's prized assets, indeed one of the nation's prized assets—a jewel in the Australian crown. He was right: it is a jewel for the people who live in the local community, who are lucky enough to live in the local community, but it is also a jewel for all those who live in the broader Sydney area, all those who visit Sydney and, indeed, the nation. We did have an opportunity to get it right. Some of the things we have got right in this bill, but, unfortunately, due to the failure of the amendments which we pursued, we have not got it quite right. We would urge the government, at this last opportunity, to reconsider its position. The Democrats stand condemned for their sell-out on this important environmental issue. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>24524</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Grayndler for his contribution, some of which I agree with and some of which I disagree with.

We have benefited enormously from the contributions the Democrats and the ALP have made. As I said before, I think this is a much better bill because of the very constructive contributions that have been made by non-government members. I would particularly commend the Democrats for the way they have stood up for the best possible environmental and aesthetic values.</para></talk.start><para>While I am on my feet, I probably should also praise the member for Grayndler's friend and mentor, a great former member of this House, Tom Uren. Tom Uren was a very controversial member of this place. He was a very controversial figure in his own party, for that matter, but the fact is that he has been a committed conservationist for the whole of his life and I think he has played a very positive and constructive part in this debate, even though I do not entirely agree with his assessment of where we are at now.</para><para>We have come a long, long way as a result of the dialogue and the negotiations that have gone on among the government, the Democrats and the opposition in the Senate. I just would like to stress two things at this point. First, we have increased the membership of the trust. We will have an elected local government representative on the trust, we will have a person representing indigenous interests on the trust, and, most of all, this land will not be sold—cannot be sold—except for Markham Close, and then only after the preparation of a most detailed plan of management and on the decision of the trust. We need to remember that Markham Close is at the moment a row of extremely undistinguished Defence houses. That particular place is not the environmental jewel that I think the member for Grayndler made out. Should the trust decide ultimately to sell that land under appropriate conditions, I think that the proceeds will be very well used to restore the environmental and heritage values of the rest of the land.</para><para>I conclude by saying that, in constructive negotiations, almost no-one gets absolutely everything that he or she wants. Inevitably, there has to be a little bit of give and take. The government has come a long way from its original bill. As I said, I think that the original bill is vastly improved because of the changes that have been made to it, and I would ask the opposition to accept that this is a pretty good outcome and to pass the legislation to enable the trust to get on with its job of doing the right thing by this priceless land in the interests of the people of Sydney and Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>24524</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to add a few comments in this debate on the <inline ref="R979">Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill 2000</inline>, because much of the land is land with which I am very familiar, and with which I have been familiar prior to becoming the member for Mackellar.

So it is an important and good outcome for us. </para></talk.start><para>Prior to becoming the member for Mackellar, I lived in Mosman, quite close to some of the land that is going to be subject to the trust. I recall a previous occasion where it was the intention of the previous Labor government to sell the parcel of pristine land that was adjacent to HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Penguin</inline>, which was quite vigorously fought by the community, including me. On that occasion, I was quite proud to take the podium together with Tom Uren—we were as one—with Barry O'Keefe and many others. We were successful in preventing that sale. What is so successful about this outcome is that, despite the criticisms of the trust by the opposition, they too have moved a long way from their desire to simply sell off pristine Defence lands to a situation where we are seeing our trust put into place.  </para><para>I would also like to say something about our defence forces, who have been the custodians of that land for a long time. Anyone who cares to visit Middle Headfor instance, Georges Heights—will see that the land that has been looked after by the Army and the Navy is in quite dramatically better condition than that which has been looked after by the state parks and wildlife service. I vividly remember that, last time I visited there, there was a great big wire fence that prevented people from getting to the land that had passed over to New South Wales. The only part of the area that was really well kept was the little lawn that surrounded one of the 1870s cottages where some of the departmental people had chosen to live.</para><para>The outcome with the establishment of the trust is the best way forward. It really does mean that these lands will be protected. It does mean that they cannot be subject to the whim of the government of the day, whatever flavour the government might be.

This legislation is the standard amendment legislation to the initial appropriation legislation that flows from the 2000 budget. I want to deal firstly with a couple of specific points that are in the appropriation legislation before the House, and then deal with some of the broader points that emerged from the government's fiscal strategy. It is important to note that in these appropriation bills there are a number of substantial corrections to the spending proposals of the government and that they give some indication of the panic in the government's fiscal strategy and of the incompetence of the government's fiscal management. There is a very substantial correction to the level of expenditure on defence which includes shifting $659 million of expenditure in the Defence portfolio from the capital account across to the current account. In other words, an amount of almost $700 million—$659 million—has been shifted from purchases of equipment and other capital items to pay for recurrent expenditure. This is a massive miscalculation on the part of the Department of Defence as to the needs of recurrent expenditure for the current financial year.</para></talk.start><para>The correction that is proposed in the health budget gives a similar indication of the government's priorities and its capacity to manage the nation's finances. There is a provision for an additional spending of $223 million on the health budget, and $130 million of that additional expenditure reflects the ever increasing blow-out in costs arising from the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. </para><para>There is also an increase in moneys to be paid to the Australian Taxation Office for the administration of the GST to the tune of $183 million. So the massively simple tax, the wonderful new tax regime, that was introduced by the Treasurer to simplify tax administration for the benefit of both the people of Australia and the administration of tax by the Commonwealth has added yet another very substantial sum to the cost of tax administration and to the complexity of tax administration in this country. The detail that we see in this legislation is just a small window into the overall fiscal administration of this government, which has been essentially profligate, which has been wasteful and which has been misdirected. These are three of the most substantial changes in appropriations that arise from the legislation before the House that illustrate the weakness of the government's fiscal management. </para><para>It is worth casting our minds back to the events that really opened the Howard government's approach to fiscal policy in 1996 and contemplating what has occurred in fiscal management by this government over that time until now. In the 1996 budget, there were cuts to spending made by the Treasurer totalling roughly $24 billion over the four years of that budget year and the three years of forward estimates. That, from the point of view of fiscal management—leaving aside the question of where the cuts were made, the grossly unfair impact they had on ordinary Australians and the savage impact they had on critical areas of expenditure like health, education and child care—one would be forgiven for thinking that this was a government that was capable of getting expenditure under control and that had implemented a very substantial program of ensuring that expenditure in this nation was very much kept in restraint.</para><para>Unfortunately, over the ensuing four years for which the $24 billion cutbacks were planned, the actual amount of additional expenditure, above and beyond the expenditure planned by the government, was $38 billion. When you compare the outcomes, that is, when you compare what the government actually did spend over that period with the amount that it budgeted to spend, you see that, far from actually making $24 billion worth of cutbacks in total expenditure, the actual expenditure outcomes ended up being higher than they would have been without any cutbacks—$38 billion additional expenditure. Unfortunately, this expenditure did not go to the areas of greatest need. It did not go to important areas of social provision like health and education; it went on other areas, and I will get to those issues in a minute.  </para><para>It is worth looking at the process that has unfolded since that time to see just how wasteful this government has been and how much it has mismanaged the finances of the Australian Commonwealth. In the midyear economic and fiscal outlook papers that were submitted to the parliament at the end of last year, the budget forecast was revised from a surplus of $2.8 billion to a proposed surplus of $4.3 billion for the current financial year, and economic growth estimates for the financial year were upgraded to four per cent. Those figures are already under a serious cloud. It is worth recalling that the budget surplus figure that was produced by the Treasurer in May last year for the current financial year was suspect from the outset; it was essentially phoney. There were a number of fiddles employed to ensure that a notional surplus could be maintained even though it was clear that in fact and in structural terms the budget of the Commonwealth was quite significantly in deficit at a time when growth was running very strongly and when clearly it should not be in deficit. </para><para>These fiddles included accounting for projected spectrum sales worth $2.6 billion as part of the recurrent revenue of the Commonwealth when clearly they are de facto asset sales, and we now know that the chance of that $2.6 billion being realised is extremely dubious at best. There will be some red faces in a number of areas at the finalisation of those sales if, as many expect, the $2.6 billion is not realised. Also, a $1.6 billion loan to the states was not accounted for. It was, in effect, a grant and was part of the GST arrangements with the states. That was a convenient way of disguising the budget impact of those arrangements. There was a bit of fiddling with Reserve Bank dividends, designed to shore up the surplus in that particular year. So we started with a budget position that was extremely fragile and fraught with fiddles. What has followed is, superficially, a strengthening of the budget position but, in reality, we all know that it is eroding day by day. In particular, the position for the forthcoming financial year, given the slowdown in the economy that is already under way, is clearly going to create major problems for the government's fiscal position.</para><para>All of this matters because, rather than consolidating our fiscal position in times of good economic growth, this government has wasted the fiscal position that it has been able to inherit and to develop. It has wasted that position profligately by spending large sums of money on programs that ultimately have delivered, in most cases, very little benefit to the structural economic position of the nation and that have been primarily driven by the desire to pork-barrel in particular electorates, particularly in marginal regional electorates held by National Party members.</para><para>If you look across the variety of programs underneath the banner of the Natural Heritage Trust, the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, the Centenary of Federation Fund and various other smaller programs—which all, conceptually, are highly worthy and which in many cases involve expenditure that, viewed in isolation, is entirely worthy and appropriate—they are essentially fragmented, have no underlying coherent theme and, when viewed from the possibility of what alternative expenditure could have been pursued, have been in most cases extremely wasteful or misdirected. In the case of the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, for example, particular projects have been funded which have been about things like drafting a communications strategy for a local council to pursue issues associated with broadbanding. Ultimately, something of that nature is almost inevitably going to spend the rest of its life gathering dust on a town clerk's shelf somewhere. </para><para>In the case of the Natural Heritage Trust, there has been no coherent overall strategy about dealing with some of the most fundamentally important issues that face Australia—particularly, the salinity problem, the decline of the Murray-Darling Basin and a variety of issues associated with water resources. There has been no overarching strategy. There has been a plethora of very small localised programs, most of them inevitably reasonable and worth while in their own right but ultimately secondary in nature and secondary in importance compared with what could have been done with those funds. So vast amounts of money have in effect been frittered away for relatively limited benefit when those funds could have been used to far greater effect in a variety of ways.</para><para>In the area of the Centenary of Federation Fund you can see the greatest waste of money. We have seen a plethora of town halls refurbished and various historic buildings and monuments get a bit of a tart up. That is all well and good. I used to be a history student, and I am very fond of history. I think it is extremely important that we understand our history, that we celebrate it and that we ensure that we learn from it. But it, like anything else, has to be dealt with according to what are the most appropriate priorities. When you spend $4 million or $5 million tarting up the town hall—giving it a bit of a paint job and a blow dry—it employs a few people for a while, and that is extremely good, but ultimately you do not get much out of it for the nation.</para><para>If that is happening on a small scale, that is fine, it does not matter; but this government is characterised by an expenditure of that nature on a vast scale. Over the last year to 18 months, we have seen the government's panic attack. Basically, the government's expenditure strategy has been driven by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. Where a headline in the form of a political bushfire has emerged, there has immediately been an expenditure response to that. A series of decisions of this kind culminated in one week in April last year. Within the space of one week, additional expenditure commitments being undertaken by the Commonwealth were increased over four years by $1.9 billion. Announcements that were made on top of the budget of $1.9 billion within one week were undertaken by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer as a result of a sequence of panics, responding to particular changes in political circumstances and particular problems.</para><para>I wish to mention briefly one of those particular problems. It is a fairly notorious example and it is illustrative of the fiscal profligacy and incompetence of this government. The so-called families program was announced by the government in April last year. They got a very nice front page headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>. It is probably the most expensive headline that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> has never run. In fact, had they simply taken out an advertisement, they probably could have got it for $100,000 and it would have been a lot cheaper for the taxpayer. They announced a program of $240 million over four years to help Australian families. There was a considerable amount of fanfare about this—how important it was for rural and regional Australia and how there would be programs that would assist Australian families.</para><para>Arising from recent information obtained, I think, from the Senate estimates process, it appears that so far only about five per cent of these funds have actually been spent and that the government has yet to determine how they are going to be spent. Some $71,000 has been spent on advertising and about $170,000 has been spent on consultants advising the government on what it might actually spend the money on. This is a paradigm example of a government that really has no clear coherent agenda, no sense of what governments need to do to improve the circumstances and the lives of ordinary Australians, but is there trying to win PR points in a political battle and using taxpayers' money wastefully in order to do so. It is a government that has no sense of what its priorities need to be and of how to assist ordinary Australians and ordinary Australian households, and it has no clear agenda of where it wishes to take the nation. All it can do is respond by pork-barrelling, by throwing money around at great expense to the Commonwealth and with minimal impact on the economic circumstances of the nation and minimal impact on the social equity and the broad fabric of our community. </para><para>It is worth adding to this rather sorry picture the performance of my counterpart. Although he is ill, and I do wish him the best and I hope that his recovery is completed very soon, I do not wish to spare him further criticism over his performance. I am sure he would not wish me to do that. There have been a number of blunders by the government—by the Minister for Finance and Administration—which have contributed to the unfortunate fiscal position that the government is now in. They include, most recently, the information technology outsourcing fiasco. We have seen a program that was supposed to deliver $1 billion in savings scathingly criticised by the Auditor-General, who revealed that the program, far from delivering savings of that magnitude, was going to deliver savings totalling only about $70 million for half the program. In other words, a program that was going to deliver a billion dollars in savings had actually racked up, for half of the territory that it covered, savings no greater than a very modest $70 million.</para><para>The cost of implementing the program had blown out threefold—it had trebled. The American consultants who had been engaged to assist in the process of implementing the program had actually been engaged without any formal contract, which was written retrospectively when it was discovered that there was no proper arrangement. So that is one blunder, with a substantial loss to the taxpayer in effect and certainly to the budget, because these savings were all factored in. These savings were already taken in budget terms and they were not appearing, so that is in effect a net negative to the budget.</para><para>Then we have the fiasco with the first tranche sale of Telstra shares where the Auditor-General found that the cost of the sale process blew out by $65 million over budget and there were a variety of mistakes made by the Minister for Finance and Administration and by the people administering on his behalf the sale process, such as, for example, providing $5 million worth of underwriting for blocks of shares where no underwriting was required and providing about half a million dollars worth of incentive payments to the people conducting the sale with respect to shares that were either being given away or not being sold. In other words, the intermediaries who were conducting the sale process on behalf of the Commonwealth got half a million dollars for doing nothing. That is just one of a number of examples identified by the Auditor-General of the incompetent way in which that sale process was handled.</para><para>The Auditor-General pointed out that the increase in the Telstra share price from the time the listing first occurred to the time when his report was being completed was 160 times the increase in the index of the Australian Stock Exchange over that time. In other words, in the Auditor-General's terms, the price for the first sale of Telstra was way below that which it should have been. To make more politically palatable the privatisation of Telstra, which was opposed then and is opposed now by a clear majority of the Australian people, the price was set at a rate substantially lower than it should have been, which meant that a lot of people who bought shares got an instant capital gain of some consequence, a fairly substantial capital gain. That was done deliberately by the government—to sweeten the pill of privatisation and to try to create a group of people in the community who were committed to further privatisation of Telstra—at enormous expense to the Commonwealth budget.</para><para>Then we have the revelation, again with the assistance of the Auditor-General, of the incompetent management by the government, since 1997 in particular, of foreign exchange transactions, particularly by the Department of Defence but also by the minister for finance's own department. The Department of Defence, by failing to conduct any sort of protection arrangement—any form of hedging arrangement with respect to fluctuations in the Australian dollar—managed to achieve a situation where, for example, it would contract to buy 14 helicopters and, by the time delivery time had arrived, it found that it could afford to buy only 11 of them because of the drop in the value of the Australian dollar. Of course, similar problems were experienced by the Department of Finance and Administration itself with respect to overseas properties and its management of our property portfolio. </para><para>Finally, we have the incompetent management of Employment National, which the shadow minister at the table, the member for Dickson, knows only too well, having been scrutinising the issue over some time. The minister for finance managed to take the performance of Employment National from a profit in the 1998-99 financial year of $72 million to a loss in the following financial year, 1999-2000, of $92 million as a result of the organisation being deliberately run down in favour of other providers, particularly providers in the charity sector. So, as well as the broad fiscal problems that I have identified in the government's approach to budget management, there have been a number of specific failings on the part of the government to deal with particular matters which have led to a substantial erosion of the overall budget position.</para><para>This has all been exacerbated in a sense by the fact that the government has changed the way that the budget is presented. We supported the introduction of accrual accounting. We started the process and the government has continued it. In a broad sense, we applaud the government for pursuing that process. Unfortunately, a variety of approaches have been adopted which have been substantially detrimental to the quality of the budget papers and to the ability of people to obtain appropriate information from the budget and to understand precisely what is going on with government expenditure. We now have an outcomes based arrangement where each particular spending category has an outcome. In the case of Defence, for example, it is the protection of Australia from foreign threat of invasion or something along those lines—something that, in measuring the actual outcomes from the expenditure, is effectively meaningless. You find that throughout all of the outcomes for the various areas of expenditure. </para><para>We have also seen the abolition of detailed forward estimates. It is no longer possible to get a sense of what the government proposes to spend on particular programs over the four-year period of the budget year and the three years of the forward estimates. We have seen the removal of particular line items relating to specific programs, specific categories of expenditure: for example, it is no longer possible to see what the budget for the Office of the Status of Women is from year to year, because that is no longer in a category of its own; it is subsumed under other categories. There are various examples of important agencies and important programs which it is no longer possible to track.</para><para>The government has also made an art form of using commercial-in-confidence as a means of disguising and preventing proper public scrutiny of its expenditure. More and more we are seeing—particularly due to greater outsourcing—the use of commercial-in-confidence in government contracts as a means of precluding proper parliamentary scrutiny of government expenditure. A classic example of this—which I have cited on many occasions—is when the member for Scullin asked a question on notice of the former Minister for Employment Services how many clients were being assisted by Job Network providers in the eastern region of Melbourne over a given time. The response was that this information was commercial-in-confidence and could not be revealed. These are people who are employing taxpayers' money—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kernot, Cheryl, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Kernot</name></talker><para>—One billion dollars a year.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name></talker><para>—One billion dollars a year—these programs are entirely funded by the taxpayer, and yet a member of parliament and, therefore, the Australian public, the community and the media are not able to know how many people are being helped by the taxpayers' money that is being expended for those purposes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is all part of a broader pattern not only of fiscal incompetence but also of secrecy and non-disclosure designed to cover the tracks. For a government that likes to portray itself as fiscally responsible, it has in fact been very good at spraying money around for little effect and eroding the fiscal circumstances of the Commonwealth. At the point when growth is starting to slow, it is going to start hitting some problems. It is fine in the good times. You can spray money around on the Centenary of Federation Fund, you can spray it around on the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund—which has funded virtually everything but infrastructure—and you can spray it around on the Natural Heritage Trust, which has funded a lot of weed pulling and various other things, but there have been very few serious, coherent strategic programs to improve the Australian environment. That is fine, you can get away with it when growth is running at four-plus per cent, but when you get into difficult times that is when the pressure comes on. </para><para>I would like to make some observations about the Labor Party's view on all these things. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation put on one of his little performances a few days ago in the United States where he announced that the Labor Party had the same policy as One Nation and that it was going to cause the value of the Australian dollar to collapse, and he made various other wild and ludicrous assertions. It having come from a government that has presided over a change in the value of the Australian dollar from US70c when it took office to US52c now, I think it is rather extraordinary that the minister would seek to claim that the Labor Party, were it in government, would cause a collapse in the value of the dollar. I am rather surprised at the effrontery of somebody in the government seeking to attack the Labor Party on that front.</para><para>It is worth going through some of the key issues so that the Labor Party's position on these matters is clear and not capable of being misrepresented by people such as the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. Firstly, the Labor Party are committed to maintaining surpluses, to continuing surpluses, and we will do so. We will do so because we will not be squandering money on a whole range of programs that are purely politically driven, that are designed to get headlines, that do not address problems and that waste money on things that are not of sufficient benefit to the Australian community. Yes, there will be programs where Labor will commit greater expenditure. We have already made a number of commitments along those lines, but the reason that we will be able to do that and the reason that we will be able to maintain surpluses and have a strong fiscal position is that we will not be squandering the money on some of the pork-barrelling that has wasted billions as a result of this government's fiscal strategy.</para><para>Secondly, the Labor Party support foreign investment and understand that foreign investment is fundamental to the future of this nation and that Australia has always depended upon foreign investment and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We encourage foreign investment. We will manage the Australian economy on the basis that foreign investment will be welcomed, and we will not be sucked into the mad, ultra economic nationalist, `close down the shop' view that One Nation and others associated with it have been peddling. Far from the suggestion put forward by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, a Labor government will welcome foreign investment because foreign investment ultimately means more economic activity in Australia and more jobs. It does not displace Australian investment. There is no loose pile of Aussie money sitting under a mattress somewhere just waiting for all those foreigners to go away so that it can be invested in the things that the foreigners would otherwise have been investing in. Foreign investment adds to Australian investment, and the key countervailing point which the federal government does not understand is that it is fundamentally important to ensure that we do not get lazy and become overdependent on foreign investment. It means that, as well as encouraging foreign investment, we need to ensure that domestic investment, indigenous Australian investment, is maintained. The key to that is the superannuation system and continuing to strengthen the compulsory occupational superannuation system that Labor put in place and that this government has effectively put on hold. That is now the foundation stone of Australian savings and of Australian investment. It is critically important to maintain that in place so that, whilst Australian investment may be increasing—which is a good thing—we do not have a reduction in Australian investment at the same time, so that the overall outcome is positive. The overall outcome is more investment, more economic activity and more jobs. </para><para>Thirdly, there is the issue of competition policy. This has been taking a bit of a battering recently, and I notice, along the lines of comments I made in a speech a week or two ago that was critical of the business lobby, that the Australian business community is all in favour of competition policy except when it comes to things like mergers involving themselves. They regard that as an unfortunate impediment to growing really big and being able to grow even bigger offshore. One thing a Labor government will not be doing is weakening competition policy with respect to mergers and acquisitions, because the notion that this is some sort of solution to the risks of Australia becoming a branch office economy is purely fallacious. It would mean less efficiency in Australia and therefore less capacity on the part of Australian companies to function efficiently and to win markets overseas. It also raises this question: if there are mergers and if we allow monopolies or duopolies to develop in key sectors in Australia, what happens after that? You get a certain degree of additional critical mass, but what happens after that? You get back to the same dynamics, the same real issues, that are determining that branch office economy problem. Equally with competition policy more broadly across all sectors, Labor will strengthen the public interest test to ensure that these matters are dealt with on their merits so that it is possible to determine what is actually going to occur when these changes are made. But Labor will not be backing away from competition policy, because ultimately these changes are in the interests of Australian consumers and the Australian economy.</para><para>Finally, Labor remains committed to an open trade policy. It remains committed to an approach which will ensure that Australia has a strong export base and that it has an open economy, which was put in place by the former Labor government and which it will continue to pursue. It is worth noting that the comments that were made by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation were 100 per cent wrong. They are very unfortunate for the interests of this nation, which needs to continue to maintain foreign investment and an appropriate value for the Australian dollar. The comments are very unfortunate, and they are very much against the interests of this nation and of the minister's own government. This government has been fiscally profligate. It has failed to manage the Australian Commonwealth's finances appropriately. It has wasted an enormous amount of money in good times, and it is soon to discover how unfortunate that has been for the Australian taxpayer.

There is no denying that the fundamental economic reforms of the past few years have laid a solid foundation for the current financial climate that we are experiencing of strong growth, low inflation and high productivity. Our economic report card shows growth averaging 3½ per cent over the past decade, but in the last three financial years we have increased to 4½ per cent. This is testament to the strong policies of this government and firm guidance of our economic direction.</para></talk.start><para>We certainly had the courage to implement the new tax system, and I think it is fair to say that, while we are experiencing what could be described as some understandable teething problems, it means that we are now internationally competitive; we have an internationally competitive tax system. This is vital for attracting new business growth and positioning ourselves as a capable and productive arm of the global economy, and this was certainly highlighted today in the report to this place by Minister Vaile on the new exporting opportunities that we have been able to access.</para><para>It is fair also to say that there is still work to done to the system. It is a new system and it is subject to adjustment and ongoing evaluation. It is also fair to say that when we identify that there are problems we are prepared to move and make sure that those issues are addressed. A good example of that was the timely review of the business activity statement recently. Any reform is not absolutely painless, but I think it is certainly manageable, and we certainly need to look at the big picture—certainly where we want to be as Australians and what we see as our economic future.</para><para>It is no small achievement to note that the spending from these appropriations bills is being serviced from revenue, funds that we actually have in the bank. It is not tacked onto some national bankcard, as was the habit with the previous administrators, who relied very heavily on borrowings to service the basic needs of the Australian community. Back in 1995-96 the Commonwealth was spending roughly the same amount on interest in servicing its own debt as it did on schools and hospitals. It has taken this coalition government to bring the budget back into surplus and to reduce the Labor debt legacy.</para><para>By the end of 2000-01 the government will have paid back some $50 billion of that $80 billion debt and will no longer have to spend those millions of dollars. Initially, we were looking at around $8,000 million to $9,000 million of taxpayers' revenue before we could spend a cent on the Australian community. We are now well on track to paying that debt off completely in the next few years, and that will mean that every cent that we raise in revenue can actually be spent on the Australian people, and that is no insignificant achievement. We need to keep reminding the people of that achievement. </para><para>I want to now go through some of the funding that we are appropriating. An amount of $740 million is to be appropriated to cover the government's decision to increase the readiness of 2nd Brigade to 28 days notice to move. This, of course, was brought about by our involvement with East Timor, and it was certainly something that needed to happen. Also, with the recent white paper and the additional funding of three per cent in real terms for the ADF, plus the $500 million for 2002 and the $1,000 million for the 2002-03 budget, we are starting to get back to a situation where we really have a defence force that is not, as it has been in the past, continually run down.</para><para>With this level of spending, there are going to be opportunities afforded to businesses in my electorate. When I think of the ADF, I think automatically of one particular company in my region, that is, NQEA. Over the last 25 years, NQEA has provided the Commonwealth with 11 landing craft type LCM8, 22 work boats, 14 Fremantle class patrol craft and one oceanographic research vessel for the CSIRO. They also handled a $200 million Royal Australian Navy project to build two hydrographic ships. These ships were later given a very high rating by the Navy and the company was told that the ergonomic design aspect was by far the best of any ship in the Royal Australian Navy. The two world-class hydrographic ships brought other accolades to NQEA, including an engineering excellence award. We are talking here about ships built by Australia in Far North Queensland which were built because of the commitment to maintaining the operation and building strength in our defence forces. With the level of funding that we now see going into the ADF, there is a tremendous opportunity for many of our businesses, including NQEA, to access some of that funding. It is certainly going to be of tremendous benefit for my region in particular and I hope that, given their track record, they will be successful in accessing a significant portion of that funding.</para><para>Concerning the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, $135 million is being appropriated primarily as a result of the government's decision to offer safe haven to Kosovars and East Timorese. There is also additional funding for looking at detention of unauthorised arrivals. We need to realise that we do have a problem. In my area over recent years we have certainly had a significant increase in illegal immigration, particularly through the Torres Strait. We cannot forget the recent incidents where illegal immigrants actually beached near Cairns. I think it is fair to say that, with the additional resources of night flying helicopters in the Torres Strait; the additional vessels that have been built for Customs; the additional powers which have been given to Customs officers in regard to detention, for example, the right to carry out arrests; and the not insignificant role which Torres Strait islanders have played in keeping an eye on any activity that is not seen to be normal, we are certainly ensuring that we are able to control this very well. It is important that we continue to acknowledge the role of the general public, without whose cooperation there is no way in the world we could expect to carry out the job. While every time we see one of these vessels apprehended there tends to be an outcry about the hordes flooding in, I would suggest that we should be highlighting the effectiveness of the authorities working to contain these problems. There is no evidence that that is not the case. They are doing a sterling job and I congratulate them for their work, particularly up in my area and in the Torres Strait. </para><para>Another $35.15 million is being appropriated for anticipated claims under the natural disaster relief arrangements. This is anticipated for payments that will be made to individuals who suffered damage as a result of Cyclone Vance in March 1999. People from my area appreciate the value of this type of financial support, given in the last three years—we have had three cyclones in three years. We had Rona two years ago which hit around the Mossman-Daintree area and inflicted a tremendous amount of damage not only on the vegetation but also on cane farms. This was followed by Cyclone Steve last year, flooding from which caused a tremendous amount of damage to cane farms. As recently as last Saturday we had another one called Cyclone Abagail, which turned out to be a bit of a non-event in that, fortunately, there was no great amount of rain. Nevertheless, there was a considerable amount of water generated from that cyclone which is certainly going to cause some damage. It is great to see that money is being put aside to ensure that in these situations we are able to draw on some resources to assist those who are affected by circumstances which are certainly well and truly out of their control. </para><para>Concerning the Department of Health and Aged Care, I note some $6.55 million is being drawn primarily for East Timorese evacuees in Australia, plus an additional $17.28 million for temporary haven for support of some 3,960 Kosovars who were evacuated to Australia. Looking at the aged care aspect of the health department funding, I think also of my community in Mossman. I noted today in question time that there was a comment made by the member for Burke suggesting that we were withdrawing opportunities for nursing home facilities from regional areas. I was amazed that such a comment would be made, given the fact that in the last two years something like 22,000 places have been put in—14,000 in the last 12 months, of which about 44 per cent have been into rural areas; of that $44 million, 74 per cent went into rural Australia. Some have gone to the Mossman area where some $425,000 has been set up to establish a multiservice unit.</para><para>They now have 15 flexible beds—high care places—in Mossman. We actually have eight beds currently in the hospital as they are going through the process of developing a multipurpose unit. This multipurpose unit will certainly guarantee the long-term viability of the Mossman community, a small sugar town north of Cairns. I should point out that the community had been fighting for about nine or 10 years for the allocation of these beds, and it was only last year that we funded them through the government, and with tremendous support from Minister Bishop. I would like to take the opportunity to commend Marge Norris and Shirley Vico, who were instrumental in driving this. In particular, I would also like to make mention of Bob Gray, who started this process many years ago. Unfortunately, he passed away before he had the opportunity to see it come to fruition. The other day I had the opportunity to go through the beginnings of the new facility. It is absolutely outstanding. I have no doubt at all that the Mossman community will be very proud of it, and I have no doubt that it will serve the Mossman community for many years into the future.</para><para>I would also like to touch on the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Some $25 million is going towards infrastructure development in the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. Mentioning infrastructure, in particular roads, brings to mind that, two days before the recent state election in Queensland, I was somewhat surprised to receive an invitation from the Queensland main roads department to a road opening—the Portsmouth bypass in Cairns. When I arrived there I was somewhat surprised that the Queensland minister Steve Bredhauer took the opportunity to be quite critical of me and the Commonwealth government, not acknowledging the fact that the road was, in fact, 100 per cent funded by the Commonwealth government. One could be a little cynical in suggesting that, by the way it was planned, he was clearly trying to take that credit two days before a state election. It needs to be pointed out that not one single cent from the state government was spent on that road. If anybody deserves to take credit for the establishment of that road, it is my good friend and the previous mayor—and, I might point out, a life member of the Labor Party—Tom Pyne, who certainly was the one who drove that and who worked very hard to achieve it. Full credit should go to Tom rather than individuals who had very little to do with it, quite frankly, but five minutes before an election stand up there and try to take all the credit.</para><para>In mentioning roads, I would also like to acknowledge the fact that at last we have been able to convince the state government to put in a nomination for a road of national importance—the Cape York Peninsula development road, some 800-odd kilometres long. Currently the road is closed for about seven months of the year, which makes it very difficult for all my communities to get in and out. It holds back economic opportunities and health, particularly relating to many of the Aboriginal communities that I have that feed off that road. It is very difficult for those communities to access affordable fresh fruit and vegetables and other supplies during the wet season, which lasts, as I say, some seven months. While funding, I understand, is fully committed for the Roads of National Importance program at this particular time, I have been assured that the Commonwealth is going to consider the late submission from Queensland. I understand that comments have already been sought on this proposal, and I will certainly be doing anything I can to ensure that we make this a reality. It is something that has been long overdue for the Cape York community. </para><para>In closing, I would like to say that, again, the appropriations in these bills are certainly very responsible. They are 100 per cent paid for; there are no borrowings here. It demonstrates again the responsible fiscal policies that we have as a government. It shows that we have continued the development of sound economic and social policies. It certainly goes way beyond the city limits—certainly out into my area—for the benefit of all Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>24536</page.no><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name><name.id>UU5</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over recent months the anger of people of rural and regional Australia has become evident. That anger, of course, has been directed— and quite correctly—at the Howard-Anderson government. Rural dwellers, such as those I represent in the electorate of Paterson, are angry at the contraction of services, at the lack of job opportunities for their children, at the inadequate health and aged care facilities, at the lack of choice of education and at government ripping money out of the public education system when, essentially, in many towns that is the only system they have. Rural dwellers are angry that the party that was supposedly created to look after the interests of rural dwellers—the National Party—has become a Liberal Party clone and is no longer doing its job.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to take this opportunity to identify the areas of declining service in the Paterson electorate specifically, and in rural Australia generally. Let us take health and aged care. Patterson has communities with no doctor. We have communities with very few doctors and we have doctors who have moved to the area to retire and who, out of the goodness of their hearts, have gone back into practice to help out in the communities where they live.</para><para>The little town of Bulahdelah—a town and region of about 1,500 people—is perched on the Pacific Highway, and is a centre where accidents are very common. There is a single doctor and there is a hospital—a hospital which, like so many other country hospitals these days, is used for stabilising patients, for recuperation and for holding patients while a diagnosis is made, and is a hospital in name only. What happened in Bulahdelah before Christmas was almost a tragedy. The sole doctor developed a serious heart condition. I guess the stress and constancy of being the only doctor in such a community took its toll. He required surgical treatment and he was off work for about a month with no-one to replace him and then he resumed duties on a half-day basis. The general practitioner in the community of Medowie—about 5,000 people—simply walked out of his practice because he could no longer stand the stress. The medical practice in my own town of Raymond Terrace has been advertising for a GP partner for about the past 18 months without any success—hardly a reply. These problems are indicative of problems faced by the whole of rural and regional Australia and they are not being addressed satisfactorily.</para><para>I now turn to aged care. We heard today from the Minister for Aged Care about the supposed increase in aged care places in rural and regional Australia. The figures she used were reminiscent of a Lotto prize list. Let us have a look at where the beds went in the Paterson electorate and I am sure, by comparison, that in every other rural and regional electorate a similar pattern would unfold. Harbourside Haven, which is one of the largest aged care facilities not only in the Paterson electorate but in the whole of Australia, got 35 low care beds. Fortunately, most of those places have already been constructed and they will soon be occupied by those in need of aged care. Moran Health got 60 low care bed licences—this is a facility that is not even on the drawing board! I believe it will take well in excess of 12 months for those aged care places to come into existence. </para><para>Let me compare that with the small community of Stroud. Stroud Community Lodge got an allocation of four low care places. I am particularly proud of this because I have worked with the committee from Stroud Community Lodge and I have been very supportive of their application over recent years. Stroud Community Lodge is symbolic of an aged care facility in a small rural community. It represents the very sort of facility that is under siege by zealous bureaucrats and by posturing ministers. Facilities such as Stroud Community Lodge are often the focal point of a small community. They involve the service clubs, they involve volunteers and they are the pride of the community. But, more importantly, they provide places for people who come from that community. They have reared their family there, they have lived their life there, they have a network of family and friends there and they want to stay there and live out the remainder of their life. </para><para>In the five years since the Howard government came to power this is the first allocation of places that has gone outside the larger population centres such as Nelson Bay, Maitland and Forster-Tuncurry. Despite the minister's glowing rhetoric at question time today, the electorate of Paterson not only has a higher number of aged people per capita but also fewer aged care places than average and, what is most important, fewer operational aged care places than it had when the Howard government came to power in 1996. That is one reason why the people of rural and regional Australia have lost faith in this government.</para><para>Another reason is Medicare, and I spoke on this last evening. This is a government that hates Medicare and I think the minister showed that at question time today, but what he does not understand is that Australians are people that love Medicare. The minister came into the House today quite happy to quote the number of people who are now covered by private health insurance. He feels that because people have private health insurance they are happy about that situation. I defy any member of this House to stand up and say that they have not had a number of calls from people who have recently joined a medical insurance fund and who now claim they are unhappy about the service and about what private health insurance brings them. They are unhappy. They know they were conned, they know they were trapped and they know there was no alternative. What this minister and this Prime Minister, in particular, do not understand is that the task of government is to give the people of Australia a health system that works. </para><para>The minister today was quite distinct in indicating that the number of procedures that had taken place in private hospitals over the past 12 months had increased and the number of procedures that had taken place in public health systems had decreased. Everyone knows why. Everyone, particularly in rural and regional Australia, knows why that is, because they live in an area where there are virtually no private hospitals and where, if they need surgical procedures, they have to go to the nearest large city where there will most likely be a public hospital. It is really the task of this minister to ensure that those people have adequate service by those hospitals. This government is failing the people of Australia. This minister does not even understand the concept of what his real task is.</para><para>From time to time, both sides of politics tend to become the prisoners of bureaucracy. Here I would like to talk about another major effect that this government has had on the communities that I represent and, Mr Deputy Speaker, the communities that you represent. I talk about dairy deregulation— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—I remind the member for Paterson that the chair does not represent an electorate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name></talker><para>—In another life, then, you do. But I will talk about dairy deregulation because over recent weeks even the Prime Minister has been repeating a furphy about Victorian milk, about something that never happened and was never going to happen, about how the dairy farmers of New South Wales and Queensland, before the decision was made on dairy deregulation, were told by the bureaucracy and by the milk processors that we were going to be flooded with Victorian milk. The fact is that not a drop of Victorian milk has come into New South Wales or Queensland; in fact, milk has gone the other way, with Murray-Goulburn sending milk into Victoria for processing. I think that is probably the way it will continue to be. This is a classic example of how governments abrogate their responsibility to communities. The minister came in here and announced that he had created a fund. It was a fund that the federal government did not put one cent into. It was a fund that was derived from the milk consumers of Australia at 11c a litre. That is how that money will be paid. It is not the federal government that is providing that money at all. Once that fund is created, the government conveniently forgets. </para></talk.start></continue><para>When I read through the recent ABARE report, I was horrified to find out that I represent two of the three communities in Australia that have suffered the most adverse effect. Dungog is the most adversely affected community and Gloucester is the third most adversely affected community in Australia. Let me just talk about the level of government assistance for these communities. I can tell you that, seven months after deregulation came into place, Dungog Council was advised that it was going to be the proud recipient of $85,000 to employ a consultant to write a report to tell the farmers of Dungog what they can do now that the dairy industry faces an almost certain demise. That report will be handed down in six to 12 months time. But I suggest that the government would then need to fund another study, because this is a dynamic situation, not a static situation; most of the farmers will no longer be there. The towns are already in decline, and it is not only the farmers who are feeling the pinch but the service people and the retailers. It will be the schools, it will be the health services—all of those things will go into decline. Dungog will lose $17 million a year in dairying income. Gloucester, a smaller community, will lose not quite as much, but it is certainly the most significant component of the income for a town like Gloucester. Yet this is a government that can simply wash its hands of those sorts of situations. Small towns like these do not have the resources to help themselves.</para><para>Looking at it in retrospect, the planning really should have been put in place before deregulation occurred—not after deregulation occurred, not after the farmers had to decide whether or not they would have a place in the future of a dairy industry. The planning is being done too late, the level of assistance is minute, and those towns most likely will never recover.</para><para>We can go on to other issues. We can go on to the sale of Telstra. There is another thing that has now suddenly had a cloud over it. I thought it was quite ironic that the minister, Senator Richard Alston, went on radio immediately before the Queensland election to say that he supported the full privatisation of Telstra, because nothing could harm rural and regional people more. We know that the level of service has declined. We know that in towns that used to have workshops of linesmen those jobs have gone. We know that when there is a telephone breakdown people are brought in from out of town. And this is a government that at the same time is telling small business people that they have to be competitive. They have to be competitive with reducing services, and that is almost an impossibility. </para><para>What this government has forgotten is that government is about people. It can talk all it likes about the economy, the tax system and the tax reforms, but, if there is no hand extended to the people of our great country, it counts for nothing. I believe that that is what this government is going to find out down the track this year. This is a government that has governed for the big end of town. It has governed for increased profits of large corporations. It has governed for people to say, `I own shares in a company.' I can well recall the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Hon. Joe Hockey, standing up here on a number of occasions saying that Australia is now the greatest shareholding nation in the world. What good are those shares if you do not have a job? What good are those shares if your children cannot find a career? I guess people of my generation were the lucky ones where we had a job for life. Young Australians today certainly do not have that luxury. Young Australians today have no idea where they are going to finish up. Many in the electorate I represent find it difficult to get a job. In the Hunter, unemployment is still over 12 per cent. I find it quite ludicrous when ministers stand up here at question time and tell us about the high level of employment, because in rural and regional Australia that is simply not a fact. If you want a job, you leave home. People who live in rural and regional Australia are definitely second-rate citizens as far as this government is concerned. This is a government that has ignored the needs of people, and it will pay dearly for it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24539</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the appropriation bills which provide funding in addition to moneys allocated in the last budget. These appropriation bills provide funding of some $2,258 million, partly offset by expected savings made against the last budgetary allocations. It is not often that I have the opportunity to speak in the House on wide ranging issues, so I am pleased that this debate provides a rare opportunity to highlight some recent developments and issues of importance to the people of my electorate.</para></talk.start><para>I have received a letter from Mike Rann, leader of the Labor opposition in South Australia, claiming that there has been a multimillion dollar windfall tax at the expense of South Australian motorists. I am urged in the letter to support Kim Beazley who will, supposedly, reduce the cost of petrol at the pump for motorists. This is nothing short of a cynical stunt and I remind Labor of their record. Mr Beazley and the Labor Party, who opposed the government's fuel tax cuts, are now shamelessly claiming that the recent increases in the price of fuel are the fault of the federal government and the GST. Labor's record on petrol tells you more than their empty promises. When Labor came to office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre; when it left office, excise was 34.183c per litre, an increase of over 28c per litre or over 450 per cent. Labor introduced excise indexation in August 1983. As indexation is linked to the CPI, petrol excise increased far more under Labor, with an average of 5.2 per cent inflation between 1983 and 1996, than it has under the coalition, with an average of 1.4 per cent inflation between 1996 and 2000.</para><para>Since coming to office in 1996, the coalition has never increased petrol excise as a budget measure, continuing the usual indexation in line with CPI. By contrast, on five occasions the Labor Party legislated to increase the petrol excise over and above inflation adjustments. These increases amounted to 9.5c per litre, with 5c of that increase—7c for leaded fuel—announced in their now infamous 1993 tax hike budget after promising in the election campaign that they would not increase taxes. Not once did the Labor Party compensate motorists for its CPI indexation or its discretionary increases in fuel excise. Of course, Labor has no plans to reduce petrol excise and it would not abolish indexations.</para><para>On the <inline font-style="italic">AM </inline>program on 21 August 2000, Labor's deputy leader and shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, was asked three times whether Labor would cut petrol excise in office. Mr Crean refused three times to give any commitment that Labor would cut excise. In an interview with Michael Spooner from the ABC in Central Queensland on 31 March 2000, Mr Crean was asked: </para><quote><para>What sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?</para></quote><para>Mr Crean answered:</para><quote><para>Well, what we've—basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes. We always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime. That wasn't the issue.</para></quote><para>I challenge Mr Rann to say how much he would forgo of the $154 million, which is equivalent to 6.3c per litre, that is collected by the Commonwealth for funding to South Australia. What commitments would he give as he approaches a state election in South Australia? How would he reduce the cost of petrol? And, as a consequence, which schools and hospitals would he reduce funding to? The Prime Minister said that he is having a careful look at petrol pricing. I remind colleagues of the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 21 February this year which said:</para><quote><para>Any sudden unwinding of the fuel excise system will hurt the Budget and do the country much more harm.</para></quote><para>It also said:</para><quote><para>The brutal facts of the federal Budget are quite clear. Excise cuts of 1¢ per litre would cut revenue by about $300 million. A serious cut of 5¢ to 10¢ a litre, which voters would really notice, would carve $2 billion to $3 billion from the Budget, sending it into deficit in the absence of other cuts to spending. Possible renewed weakness in the dollar in response to a weaker Budget could even wipe out much of the planned petrol price cut, because the oil price is set in US dollars. The latest State government political fad of 24-hour price freezes is only going to make the petrol market less efficient and will probably result in new complaints when a sustained oil price fall should be reducing retail prices.</para></quote><para>It goes without saying that I want my constituents to pay less for petrol and I know its high price impacts on their weekly expenses. I have noted that between the end of December and the middle of February, prices have fluctuated between 79c per litre and 98c per litre in metropolitan Adelaide. The question is begged: were state Labor leaders writing letters of concern to federal Labor when interest rates for farmers, small business people and home owners were going through the roof?</para><para>I have recently been looking at some old newspapers of 1989 and 1990. There are some very interesting advertisements. The <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of 5 August 1989 said that if you decided on a three-year fixed rate and you were lucky, you could get 16.5 per cent for a home loan. The variable rate and interest only was 19.75 per cent. On 18 June 1990, a National Australia Bank ad which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> advised clients that the benchmark rate was 18.25 per cent, the base rate was 18.75 per cent, the home loan rate was 16.5 per cent, home equity loans were 18.5 per cent and the flexi plus mortgage rate was 18.5 per cent; while the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of 8 August 1989 carries a Hindmarsh Adelaide advertisement extolling the benefits of a $50,000 loan at 17 per cent for 25 years. These figures are grim reminders of Labor's legacy.</para><para>By contrast, in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> yesterday, the National Australia Bank advertised a fixed home loan rate of 4.99 per cent per annum and the Adelaide Bank was advertising a home loan rate from 5.49 per cent. Having discussed the Mike Rann letter, no doubt a stunt emanating from a Labor Party campaign committee meeting, I am reminded of other Labor Party campaign stunts. The issue of preferences involving the ALP and a so-called Independent candidate, Rita Hunt, is currently under investigation by the Federal Police. Because of that investigation I will refrain from commenting, other than to inform the House of what has already been publicly revealed by the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>. `No GST' candidate, Rita Hunt, was a candidate at the last federal election in my electorate of Adelaide. One of the largest unions affiliated with the Labor Party, the shop workers union, told the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> it helped fund her campaign. The <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> later revealed that the Australian Electoral Commission records show that neither Rita Hunt, nor the shop workers union, disclosed any funding arrangements between them. I quote from an opinion piece written by Samantha Maiden for the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>: </para><quote><para>Should you, the voter, know when a union that funds the ALP to the tune of $114,000 in this state and $300,000 nationally backs an Independent candidate?</para><para>When voters cast their ballot for an independent voice in a tightly contested marginal seat, is it relevant to know one of the ALP's largest donors is paying for photocopying, printing costs and manpower? If you believe it is relevant, you would have been kept in the dark at the last election because the union didn't disclose it. Just say you really got a bee in your bonnet and went and checked the Australian Electoral Commission records on funding disclosure. You would still be none the wiser.</para></quote><para>On 2 February this year the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> revealed further, and particularly relevant, information. A senior member of the state Labor Party headed the No GST coalition which fielded a `dummy' Independent candidate for the marginal seat of Adelaide. A document obtained by the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> shows that Adelaide solicitor, Jeremy Moore, was chairman of the No GST coalition at the same time that he had an elected internal position in the ALP. Mr Moore is a member of the ALP state executive and fifth on the party's ticket for the Legislative Council. Phil Coorey, writing for the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> on 2 February this year, says:</para><quote><para>A printing account for some of Ms Hunt's campaign expenses was sent to Mr Moore care of his city legal practice address. Dated September 24 1998—about three weeks into the election campaign—the account charges $487 for posters, art work and films for `Rita Hunt—Adelaide'. The account lists Mr Moore as `the Chairman (sic) No GST'.</para></quote><para>Whichever way these revelations and investigations are viewed, there can be no escaping the unpleasant reality that Labor was trying to dupe the voters of Adelaide and was happy to use any trick in the book. It is no surprise to me that the state ALP member for Ross Smith, Ralph Clarke, would say on ABC radio in Adelaide on 7 February this year:</para><quote><para>Well effectively what I've been saying is, we need to change the culture within the Labor Party in South Australia. We still have a culture of whatever it takes.</para></quote><para>I am pleased to be able to remind the people of my electorate that, while no doubt there is much more the government can and will do for our country, 800,000 more people are in jobs since we came to government, home loan interest rates are lower now than they have been for 30 years—in other words, pre-Whitlam—and inflation is at its lowest in 40 years. These circumstances do not occur by chance. Should Labor come to office and once again bring things unstuck, the Australian people would look back fondly to the year 2001.</para><para>I now turn to other events in my electorate. In January I was pleased to join the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Mr Alfred Huang, in officially naming and opening Adelaide's Pathway of Honour—a project with which I have had personal involvement over a number of years. The Pathway of Honour, running between King William Road and Kintore Avenue, links a number of Adelaide memorials commemorating South Australian military units which served their country in war and in peacekeeping forces from the Boer War and the Boxer Rebellion right through to the recent Australian efforts in East Timor.</para><para>The Pathway of Honour is a special place, almost a sanctuary amongst the trees in the heart of Adelaide, where future generations can remember the sacrifices made for them by men and women who served their country in two world wars and other conflicts. I have been delighted to obtain funding for various monuments. I am determined that future generations of South Australians will be reminded of the sacrifices made by the men and women who are commemorated along this pathway.</para><para>At the commencement of the walk is the United Ex-service Women memorial which I unveiled in April 1997 and which has great personal significance for me. I say `personal' because for two years I worked with the late Coral Farrelly, whom I much admired, to see the monument come to fruition. We got the money by campaigning to a number of sources, the largest proportion coming from the Commonwealth when we came to government. Not only did we get the money; we got the design and we got the end result. </para><para>I pay special tribute to Bill Schmitt, who is the Secretary of the 2/3 Machine Gun Battalion Association and the Secretary of the Ex-Prisoners of War Association of South Australia, and a former prisoner of Changi. I met Bill during the very special Australia Remembers year of 1995. We have done quite a few things together and, when Bill sought my help to have the walkway named and recognised, I just knew that I had to set about the task and make sure it happened.</para><para>Early on Sunday morning, 11 February, I had the honour of representing the federal government at the farewell of Australian Army personnel leaving from Adelaide for a six-month deployment in East Timor. Our prayers, thoughts and best wishes go with our troops as they represent our country and assist our near neighbour. The group of 39 Defence personnel from Keswick Barracks 3rd Health Support Battalion are mainly Army reservists and part of the first general reserve unit to deploy operationally to East Timor. They underwent final checks in Darwin before travelling to East Timor on 15 February to join their advance party of 10 members in the United Nations Military Hospital.</para><para>This group of general reservists were trained in Adelaide and joined 1,600 other Australians currently deployed with the multinational force in East Timor. They are a highly trained and specialised medical unit who left behind their civilian employment and families and friends in Adelaide to take up positions in the United Nations Military Hospital, working with specialists from 30 other nations involved in the peacekeeping force. All Australians should feel proud of the sacrifices these Defence personnel and their families are making to help the East Timorese people, contributing to a stable and secure East Timor as it moves towards independence.</para><para>This is the first time a general reserve unit has been deployed to East Timor, and it will form the majority of a joint health unit, under the command of Colonel Viki Anderson, an Adelaide based medical specialist. I know that the people of East Timor will be forever grateful for the medical services and help this unit will provide.</para><para>Most members will no doubt agree that the majority of constituents who contact their electorate offices do so when they want something done. Helping people is one of our important roles as elected representatives of the people. However, it is always very gratifying to receive a letter of thanks and to hear that our efforts have had some good results. This government has taken initiatives to assist pensioners and self-funded retirees and I would like to quote a letter from one of my constituents, Dorothy Evans, who asked me to convey the following message:</para><quote><para>I want to ask you to convey my thanks to the Prime Minister and all concerned, including yourself, for the improvement in my circumstances due to the raised level of income and also the Self-Funded retirees Bonus. I am now in possession of a Pensioner Card occasioning cuts in several areas such as Council rates, car registration and Driving Licence, telephone, electricity etc as well as receiving a very good Bonus payment.</para></quote><para>School funding is always important, and the education unions have already broadcast that they will spend their members' fees campaigning against the government at the next election. Most parents I know would prefer the unions' efforts to be focused on teaching rather than political activity. Contrary to union and Labor Party rhetoric, the Howard government has no agenda to expand the non-government sector at the expense of government schools. The government's objectives would be equally well met if parents were to see government schools as an even more attractive option and the flow from the sector were reversed. </para><para>The Commonwealth is leading the way in financial support for government schools. Commonwealth spending in government schools is at the highest level ever. Total funding for government schools in this year's budget is $2 billion, and over the next four years is $8.6 billion. Every state and territory has received increased funding every year from the Howard government for government schools. There have been no cuts whatsoever to funding for government schools as claimed by the unions and the Labor Party. This year the Howard government is spending $402 million more on government schools than Labor did in its last year of office, an increase of 26 per cent. </para><para>While the Commonwealth provides funding for both government and non-government schools, historically it has always had a bigger role than the states in the funding of non-government schools. Whether it is the right judgment or not, it is not for any of us, or for me personally, to judge to which school parents choose to send their children. Recent data from the Bureau of Statistics show that parental choice in schooling is not confined to families who can afford high fees. For example, of the 21 per cent of school students who come from families with an annual income of less than $26,000, 20 per cent attend a non-government school. Of students who come from families in middle-income brackets—between $41,600 and $77,999—over 31 per cent choose non-government schools. These data shatter the idea that non-government schooling is somehow elitist and divisive.</para><para>Given the fact that many parents make a significant financial sacrifice and contribution to send their children to non-government schools, and pay their taxes in full thus saving taxpayers more than $2 billion a year, the government has decided to increase funding to non-government schools, purely on the basis of fairness and equity. It is a matter of concern that there are some people who seek to gain political advantage by constantly talking down government schools, claiming—incorrectly—that they are being run down and cannot deliver quality education. Personally, I have very fond memories of the government school that I attended and feel that it is unfortunate if government schools, and the teachers that teach in them, have their reputations harmed by the way the unions and the Labor Party are acting.</para><para>This point was reinforced to me recently by Mr Allan Wilcox, Australasian representative of the European Council of International Schools. Mr Wilcox is a distinguished Australian educator with considerable experience teaching and working in international schools overseas. On returning to Australia after 31 years, Mr Wilcox heard and believed the media reports and union rhetoric that Australian schools were run down and that the quality of education in this country was poor. Having visited numerous government and non-government schools in Australia, Mr Wilcox informed me that he was pleasantly surprised to find that this is not the case at all. In his opinion, Australia has some of the best schools in the world, even when compared alongside schools of high international repute such as the International School of Geneva, the United Nations International School in New York and the Vienna International School.</para><para>If we listen to the teachers unions and the Labor Party, it is easy to think that our schools are in crisis. Although there is always scope for improvement, this is not a true snapshot of the state of education in this country. Such misinformation is a gross disservice to the hardworking principals and teachers in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24543</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1193">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001</inline> allocates additional expenditure to the Department of Health and Aged Care, and in particular—and this is what I want to focus on tonight—additional money for one particular drug under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It provides an additional $36.8 million just for this financial year for the arthritis drug Celebrex. This is unfortunately way short of what the final costs for this new medicine will be to the Australian taxpayer. Tonight, I want to go through the story of how Celebrex came to be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and of the implications for our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and for the budget.</para></talk.start><para>The matter is of very serious concern. The original budget estimates for Celebrex were $217 million over four years. In the five months since Celebrex has been on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it has cost Australians a staggering $92 million. On rough estimates, there is going to be a $600 million budget blow-out over the next four years—equivalent to the amount of money the Commonwealth government has short-changed our public hospitals. It is a budget blow-out that the Australian taxpayer should not be paying.  </para><para>Let us look at how this budget blow-out came to be from the self-proclaimed great economic managers that we have on the other side. If the Minister for Health and Aged Care had only taken the advice of his independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and listed the drug at a cost-effective price, with a price volume agreement, there would be much more significant controls over how much Celebrex is costing the federal budget. But, of course, that is not what occurred. Australians are, in fact, very fortunate to have one of the best subsidised medicine schemes in the world. Medicines are affordable in Australia because of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Unlike people in the United States, Australians do not have to go without food or heating or other necessities of life in order to afford critical medicines. In fact, tonight on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, we saw a very clear picture of what that means in the United States: 13 million elderly Americans have no health insurance cover for their prescription medicines. The <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> also showed a number of those Americans going across the border to Canada to get access to affordable medicine; otherwise they just were not going to be able to get the medicines they needed for their health. </para><para>As I say, the scheme that we have in Australia does deliver all of us a fantastic program that makes sure that we can afford our prescription medicines; but, unfortunately, it is under threat from this government. It is under threat from budget blow-outs, such as the one we are seeing tonight from the drug Celebrex, that will, if we continue to have decisions like this, threaten the ongoing viability of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; budget blow-outs will weaken the reputation of our cost-effective scheme. It is also under threat because this minister for health appointed an industry lobbyist to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and then so many experienced members resigned in protest. It is under threat particularly because it is clear—as a result of the decision that I will outline now on Celebrex— that this minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, exposed himself to be bullied by the pharmaceutical companies into paying a higher price for this new drug Celebrex.</para><para>The government has set a very dangerous precedent by listing Celebrex on the PBS at a price higher than that considered cost effective by the previous Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. We have very serious concerns about the way in which this minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, listed Celebrex on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For the first time ever, the minister for health ignored the pricing conditions recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for a drug. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended that Celebrex be listed at $1 a day, with a price volume agreement. Instead, the Howard government set the price for this drug at $1.17 a day and with no cap on the number of scripts issued at the higher price. The minister blames the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority for this result; but I should say again that this is the first time the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority also has not agreed with the PBAC's price recommendations. It is the first time a minister for health has approved a drug for listing on the PBS at a higher price and with less stringent conditions than those recommended by its expert committee, the PBAC. Under the National Health Act, the PBAC is required to take into account economic factors, including the cost effectiveness of a drug, before it can recommend listing on the PBS. </para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority and the minister have now set a very new precedent. They have effectively downgraded the role of the PBAC by not taking the advice that it is legally required to give. They did not take the advice that was provided by the PBAC about the price at which Celebrex should be listed. And you have to ask the question: why did the minister ignore this advice? Why did he decide to list the drug at a higher price and without any price volume caps? The minister's answer to the parliament was that, if the government had not paid the higher price without a price volume agreement, ` the drug would never have been listed'. What he is effectively saying is that he has been bullied by the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Pharmacia into accepting a price for a drug that was not cost effective. He is the first minister for health to have buckled under this industry pressure. He buckled under pressure from what is now known as his favourite pharmaceutical company, Pfizer. The parliament knows all about this minister's close relationship with Pfizer. We have had quite a lot of questions and discussion about it right here. He, of course, has been seen to be talking up their drugs, and they then pay for advertisements for him in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine. Around the place he is becoming known as the `minister for Pfizer'. The minister's actions, of course, fundamentally undermine the Australian pharmaceutical benefits approval process.  </para><para>The PBAC found that, compared with current therapy, the advantages of Celebrex in terms of safety and efficacy were only valid at a lower price. Once again I say to the House that the minister ignored that advice and listed the drug anyway at a higher price—one that the industry demanded. As if this was not bad enough, the pharmaceutical company came along, argued for a higher price, and the minister caved in to it. The company is also responsible for providing data to the PBAC that estimates the volume that it expects to sell over the coming year and into the future. What happened in the case of Celebrex is that the companies concerned, Pfizer and Pharmacia, seemed to have drastically underestimated the amount of Celebrex that was going to be bought by Australians. We can certainly see that in this budget blow-out. Unfortunately, from what I hear, this is a common tactic amongst the pharmaceutical companies—underestimate the demand so that the cost of the drug will not frighten the horses. But, by the time it gets out of control, by the time it is out there in the market and people are having it prescribed, it takes some time for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority and the Drug Utilisation Subcommittee to review the whole pricing issue. </para><para>These committees usually only review once a year—it takes time for the process to run its course—so the companies get access to a higher price based on these soft figures before they are called to account. We should have known about this and we should have had the companies concerned present to the committee the United States data which demonstrated that, in the United States as well, there was a huge uptake of Celebrex. We should have had that information available to us. That data would have then been able to be used to prevent this massive blow-out to the Australian budget. </para><para>We also find recently that there has been some new information received on the efficacy and safety of Celebrex. There has been a review of clinical trials by the advisory council to the United States Food and Drug Administration that has concluded that Celebrex shows:</para><quote><para>... no clinically meaningful safety advantage in upper (gastrointestinal) safety ...</para></quote><para>and did not cause fewer stomach related side effects than cheaper products. This, once again, is contrary to Dr Wooldridge's public comments at the time he announced that Celebrex would be listed on the PBS. He described the decision as:</para><quote><para>... the biggest single decision that has been taken in the 52 year history of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme ...</para></quote><para>He went on to say that the drug represented a `major breakthrough' that relieved symptoms of arthritis without the gastric irritation caused by traditional drugs.</para><para>The conclusions of the FDA review, which were released in the United States on 7 February this year, show that Australian taxpayers are paying $33 per prescription for a drug that has now been shown to have efficacy and safety similar to current therapies which cost between $9 and $15—so, $33 compared to drugs of similar safety and efficacy that we could have got for somewhere between $9 and $15. The results certainly should teach this minister for health two important lessons: one, to stop appeasing the pharmaceutical industry by heaping praise on new products and, more importantly—and this really goes to the heart of the issue before us—to take the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.  </para><para>We are now paying a very high price because this minister ignored the advice of the PBAC about the price at which Celebrex should be listed. It will cost as much in its first year as it was budgeted to cost over four years and, as a result, the government is facing a $600 million cost blow-out. There certainly are many arthritis sufferers who are using Celebrex, but these people do need to be confident that the government is listening to expert advisers, rather than making decisions that just line the pockets of drug companies.</para><para>Just tonight on the ABC news there was a report that the National Prescribing Service are so concerned about this drug that they have launched a new inquiry. They are concerned about this drug from two points of view: firstly, the increase in the number of adverse events—that is, the number of people that are having bad effects from Celebrex; and, secondly, they are very concerned about the aggressive marketing that has been undertaken for this drug that has led to this very significant blow-out in cost.</para><para>All this information has come out and was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper following the government's appointment of an industry representative to the PBAC. Of course, if the PBAC is not able to carry out its responsibilities and the industry is able to dictate to the government which medicines are listed on the PBS and at what price, then the great concern that Australians have is that the budget for our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will blow out further, providing this government with an excuse to restrict access to the PBS or increase prices to consumers. That really is the most serious concern that comes from this blow-out and from ignoring and downgrading the advice of the PBAC. </para><para>We have just been sent a copy of a confidential minute that was sent to the Minister for Health and Aged Care last December just when he was considering the changes to the membership of the PBAC. The minute outlines how, in fact, the minister should have managed the transition from the old committee to the new committee. It recommends, for example, that, because of, as they say in the minute:</para><quote><para>... the litigious atmosphere which has recently emerged from sections of the pharmaceutical industry ... It is of concern that an inexperienced chair and an uncertain committee could be intimidated by this situation into recommending the listing of some drugs which would not normally be regarded as cost effective. The fiscal implications of even one such decision could be substantial.</para></quote><para>That is, obviously, a very grave concern. It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>... as many existing members should be reappointed as possible. If any fewer than eight members (including the chair) carry over into next year, it is our judgment that the new PBAC will find it very difficult to fulfill its function.</para></quote><para>Well, they have not got anything like eight members from the last committee—only two of the old committee members stayed on, and they are the most inexperienced members: both have had less than 12 months experience on this very complex committee. In fact, we now have 10 new members on this committee making decisions about which of our medicines are going to be listed as subsidised medicines. Only two members from the old committee are still there, and those are the ones with the least experience of all. Many of the other members, of course, refused to serve on the committee, because the minister insisted on putting an industry lobbyist onto this very important decision making committee. </para><para>So we have this very experienced committee—and I just go back to the minute which came from the whole of the old Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee—sending a confidential minute to the Minister for Health and Aged Care warning him that, if any fewer than eight members were to continue on the committee, it would expose the PBAC and, more importantly, the government and our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to very serious risk. The most serious risk is that some drugs which are not cost effective will be listed because of the pressure that the pharmaceutical companies could bring to bear on the new committee. </para><para>This minute also refers to the extremely important role that the staff play in advising the committee and it recommends the importance of maintaining the key officials in their posts. I see in the most recent edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Observer</inline> that, alongside this huge shake-up in the PBAC, there has also been a major shake-up of the prescription medicine bureaucracy. So not only have we seen the resignation of most of the people from the PBAC; we have also seen a very big shake-up of the people who are responsible in the bureaucracy as well. That means that the whole Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is put in a very dangerous situation.</para><para>This scheme is a critical part of Australia's universal health care system, and certainly we on this side of politics, the Labor side, will continue to fight against the government's changes. We do not support an industry lobbyist being on the PBAC. As far as we are concerned, the independence of the PBAC is critical to making sure that Australia's world leading process for determining which medicines are subsidised remains independent of industry interference. It is absolutely vital that we do not go down the American path and see medicines become unaffordable. We want to make sure that this outstanding scheme, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee are guaranteed. Certainly that will be the case under a future Labor government. We are very worried that the blow-out in the cost of this drug, Celebrex, means that under this government we will see medicines removed from the PBS to bring this scheme under control and, even more worryingly, that the price to consumers of medicines under the PBS will be increased by this government to pay for this appalling cost blow-out. We are going to have to wait some time before the independence of the PBAC is returned, but that will certainly be a Labor commitment at the next election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>24547</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support <inline ref="R1193">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001</inline>. In particular, I want to address some of the environmental issues and expenditures that we as a government are very proud to put before the Australian people in the dawn of this new century. This year we celebrate 100 years of a united, federated Australia. In 1901 the colonies relinquished their separate allegiance to the Crown in exchange for, amongst other things, common defence and immigration policy, and postal and meteorological services. They also empowered the new Commonwealth government to raise some taxes to finance these initiatives. But what the colonial governments did not choose to relinquish was any law-making or regulation to do with their longstanding interests in their own lands or water or natural resources management. Those particular areas of their colonial activity were regarded as not the business of the new Federation or Commonwealth government.</para></talk.start><para>It was three-quarters of a century later, in 1975, that the Commonwealth first enacted some natural resource legislation in the form of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. That was 74 years after federation. So for most of the 20th century we saw the states and territories compartmentalising their ecosystems, the continent's rivers and artesian basins, their coastal fisheries and their inland catchments, according to whether all or part of them fitted within their borders. The Murray River, the boundary between New South Wales and Victoria and between Victoria and South Australia, was treated as a line on a map dividing one jurisdiction's business from another's. The state of New South Wales understood that its territory extended to the top bank on the Victorian side. It is interesting that in the very earliest days, when the first paddle steamer to make its way up that river reached its grand destination near Albury, it was greeted with a demand for customs to be paid from the New South Wales colonial government, which saw the river border as also the place where you would expect the trade between the two colonies to be dealt with by way of tariffs. </para><para>It was at a non-government conference—in other words, a local people's conference—organised in 1902 on the banks of the Murray at Corowa, after a very serious series of droughts, that the locals demanded that there be some recognition of the need for interstate cooperation in the sharing of the waters. More than 10 years later, in 1915, the River Murray waters agreement was signed by the governments of Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It was another two years before the River Murray Commission managed to get agreement on the regulation of the main stream of the Murray to ensure that the three riparian states received their agreed share of the Murray River's waters. At that time, however, it was beyond the powers of the commission to deal with problems in tributary streams or adjacent land use. It could not deal with flood mitigation, erosion or catchment protection, water quality, the needs of flora or fauna, recreational, urban or industrial use, or in fact any environmental consequences of the river water's allocation or consumption by the users in the states along the river. The commission was confined to constructing locks and weirs along the Murray and the lower part of the Darling or Murrumbidgee.</para><para>It was not until the 1960s—over half a century later—that the River Murray Commission conducted some salinity investigations. By then, the saltwater intrusions into the Murray, in particular from the irrigation districts on the Victorian side, were very serious indeed. While the first investigations took place in the 1960s, it was another 20 years later, in 1982, that the River Murray Commission's role was broadened to take into account some water quality issues. After intensive pressure and two more years of intensive meetings between negotiators from four governments—not including Queensland—the Murray-Darling Basin agreement was achieved. This agreement, negotiated only 15 years ago, put in place a process for cross-basin consideration of the effective management of the water and land and other natural resources of the states. The agreement included the ACT, four states and the Commonwealth—all of which have some jurisdictional powers within the great Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's largest river catchment area, supplying some of the most significant food resources of Australia—in an area the size of Spain.</para><para>I would like to tell you that the 85 years of our failure to address the basin as an integrated catchment are now well behind us. I would like to tell you that we learned our lessons along the way: from the different ways of managing the irrigation systems deriving from the streams in the great Murray-Darling Basin system, how we have learned about different vegetation management issues, how we have learned that you cannot charge different prices for water from the same system and have maximum efficiency and a competitively neutral situation when it comes to product being sold within our Australian marketplace. But, sadly, we still see the absurdity of ecosystems divided by state borders and, while COAG water law reform has done a magnificent job so far, the job is far from done. As we enter the third tranche of the COAG water law reform process, there are still some states with a great deal of distance to travel before they bring in the sorts of reforms that we know as a country we cannot afford to ignore.</para><para>Let me talk about the absurdity of ecosystems still being divided by state borders, particularly on the Murray River. I am the member for Murray, and my family has lived there for six generations. I understand only too well the problems of living on an interstate border, dividing two great states, Victoria and New South Wales. We have parts of one wetland and forest ecosystem managed with different objectives and levels of protection from other parts. I am talking about the largest river red gum forest in Australia, the Barmah-Millewa forest, around Echuca. The forest has two names because, of course, two states, New South Wales and Victoria, claim part of the forest and wetlands within it. The Barmah-Millewa wetlands have the Murray River flowing through them. I could have said `are divided by' the river, but that would be to fall into the old ways of thinking. On the Victorian side, for decades now we have had the wetlands Ramsar listed. In other words, they are recognised for their significance to migratory wetland bird species, which come there as part of their great trek from Pacific areas through Australia, through those wetlands on the Murray River, and down towards the south. The Victorian side has had its part of those wetlands Ramsar listed for several decades. The New South Wales side still does not have that listing, and yet it is the one ecosystem. The birds have no idea, when they fly from one bank of the river to the other, that they are entering two differently managed and protected parts of the one ecosystem, because one state jurisdiction has nominated their side of the wetlands while the other has failed to do so. One half remains unlisted as different government departments and agencies in New South Wales argue about who should be the lead agent managing a Ramsar listed site on the New South Wales side. </para><para>This is clearly nonsense. Interestingly, in the great Barmah-Millewa forest there is an organisation called the Barmah-Millewa Community Forum, drawn from community and government representatives from both New South Wales and Victoria. The forum advises on forest and water management. It is a model of cooperation because those representatives see themselves as having a shared community of interest. They have the interests of the whole of the biggest red gum forest in Australia absolutely at heart. They understand that this huge area should be managed as one ecosystem, and yet the Murray River is still treated as the Great Wall of China; as a barrier rather than as an artery running through that part of Australia. Clearly this is nonsense, and it is doing a great deal of damage to what is one ecosystem that needs to be managed with the same objectives and the same levels of protection and resourcing on either side of the state border.</para><para>While it was the Murray River communities from the different states, desperate to guarantee their access to the water, who brought the governments to the table in 1915, it has required very special action over many years to have the same level of cross-catchment cooperation on farm properties, to bring farmers to understand that they cannot behave as our states have done in the past and manage their farms or their land holdings as if their neighbours did not exist. In Australia, we have had a long-entrenched set of rural values which state that, if you own a farm, it is your right and your business to manage that farm in such a way that you will do your best for your family and for your family's future. It is your own farm to manage in your very best interests and in the best way that you can. </para><para>It has taken us until very recently to foster a new understanding that no farm family stands alone when it comes to managing sustainably and for the long term. No farming family or land manager in Australia can deal with ecosystem degradation by farming as if they were an island. We now understand the damage done to the fragile environment of Australia, the largest and driest continent on earth. We understand that we have to sustain the ecosystem at the same time that we manage agribusiness production. We have to manage urban and industrial development in such a way that we pass on to future generations a land and water resource that has its biodiversity preserved and that is in better condition than it has been for the last 100 years of unsustainable development.</para><para>What has been the legacy of our past failure to manage natural resources across catchments in an integrated way? Of course, it is the loss of biodiversity. It is soil erosion, nutrient loss, soil salinisation—some of it occurring so fast that in one generation the productivity of a farm is lost—and algal blooms, to name a few of the problems. We do know better now, and in the beginning of the 21st century this government has put that better understanding into practice, building in particular on the work of the Natural Heritage Trust, the best resourced environmental package that any federal government has ever put into place. The Natural Heritage Trust began with a one-stop-shop process and some other programs that were in existence before the NHT, but in particular in the first year the aim was to make sure that there were physical, measurable changes on the ground. As the Natural Heritage Trust has evolved, it has become patently clear that it will be across catchments and across regions that our most important work has to be done and our most sustainable work will be achieved. </para><para>On 3 November 2000 our Prime Minister built on the Natural Heritage Trust and announced at the conclusion of the Council of Australian Governments meeting that the Commonwealth and the states had reached agreement on the Commonwealth proposal in relation to dryland salinity and water quality. One century after Federation had been brought into being, with the colonies agreeing that the Commonwealth should not in fact be there to organise across jurisdictional borders, the Commonwealth led the states and territories to understand that unless we in the future act in a coherent and cooperative way we can have no solution to and no mitigation of the worst environmental problem currently facing us, our salinity and water quality degradation. The Commonwealth will contribute $700 million of new moneys, and the states have agreed to match that with another $700 million, giving $1.4 billion in resources to, in the first instance, some 20 targeted regions which will have their salinity problems addressed in a totally integrated catchment management process.</para><para>The communities in the salinity targeted regions are in different stages of understanding what the problems are on the ground and what to do about them. In some areas, like the electorate of Murray, where three of these targeted regions occur—that is, the Goulburn-Broken, the Campaspe and the Loddon-Avoca—there is already a well-understood connection between the way farms are managed, the way water is managed and the way our ground watertables behave. There is still not, unfortunately, a full understanding of what mitigation measures there are to deal with the problems of the high watertables, and that is where these new resources will be so useful—to give the regions, already highly productive, a future in terms of enhanced productivity.</para><para>In some other parts of the country in other target regions—for example, the Ord River region in Western Australia—there is still not exactly a universal understanding of what is at risk and what the high saline watertables may do to their new irrigation developments. So there will be different strategies in different parts of the country for these 20 targeted regions. But what is consistent and understood across these 20 targeted regions is the principle; that you cannot anticipate or expect any salinity mitigation or better management unless you have the stakeholders—the land managers, the government agencies, local government, your non-government organisations and your business sector—cooperating and together agreeing on what the outcomes and the objectives must be.</para><para>So at the Commonwealth level we are working with the states on firstly bilateral and then multilateral agreements to determine what should be achieved at the end of a designated period of time of working within the special targeted regions. These are to be the agreed outputs or outcomes in terms of end-of-the-valley salinity targets. We understand the need to build the capacity of these salinity or salt affected communities so that they understand both the cause and the effect of the higher saline watertables and the range of possibilities in mitigation strategies.</para><para>We also have to ensure that, while we set about revegetating parts of the landscape, biodiversity and environmental conservation considerations are part of the revegetation thinking. Obviously, we can capture more than just the benefits for salinity through this $1.4 billion of investment in the future of all Australians; we can also address our international and domestic obligations in terms of our greenhouse gas emissions. We now understand that human induced climate change is a serious problem for this and future generations.</para><para>As a sixth generation Australian whose family has for four generations farmed a salt affected property, as the member for Murray and as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, I am proud to be part of a government that has been sufficiently strong to insist upon a coordinated and Commonwealth led approach to salinity management in this country. It has been a problem understood in states like Victoria for over 70 years. It is a problem more recently understood in the states with fewer generations of agribusiness development, like Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. But our Commonwealth government has shown leadership that will, I am sure, see salinity mitigated in a way that would not have been possible without a total catchment approach. Such a development may not have been possible without the Natural Heritage Trust first building the links between the state and federal governments so that cooperation was understood and processes were put in place. As well, this salinity management program may not have been possible without the water law reform that COAG has helped usher through with the first two tranches in the last five years. </para><para>So it is a proud moment for me as a northern Victorian to see that at last we are doing something serious about our salinity problems. It will be a long, hard haul. It will require a significant change in land management practices for numbers of people. It will require compensation for some who will not be able to continue to farm in the way that they anticipated they would be able to years ago, and who may have no viable commercial options when it comes to agribusiness production of their farms in the future. But I think that as an Australian society we are now understanding enough to realise that land managers also manage their farms for the environmental services or the good of more than just those who have depended in the past on the product of their farms for their own economic wellbeing. I commend this bill to the House, and I certainly commend the environmental works of this government to the nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24551</page.no><name role="metadata">Martin, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr MARTIN</name><name.id>8I4</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The legislation which we are debating this evening provides additional estimates for the year 2000-01 annual appropriations. Last week, the Senate estimates committees conducted a number of hearings into the purpose for which these additional amounts of money were being appropriated for the various departments of state. It is interesting that within the appropriations themselves, in particular in <inline ref="R1193">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001</inline>, one of the largest appropriations required is for the Department of Defence. An additional $1,009 million, comprising $659 million transferred from capital and additional funding of $350 million, is required. I will say more about that in a moment, but it is important that we state at the outset that, while our opposition has been indicated by the amendment circulated by us that we would want to substitute other words while not declining to give these bills a second reading, it is nevertheless important that, when you look at paragraph (4) of the amendment being proposed by the opposition, we refer to `mismanagement of the Defence Budget'.</para></talk.start><para>In recent times, we have seen a change in the leadership of Defence as represented in the national parliament. John Moore, the former Minister for Defence and member for Ryan, who has now retired, was asked to move on by the Prime Minister. In his view, there was a need for change, to bring in some fresh blood. So what did we end up with? We ended up with Minister Peter Reith coming across. In the last couple of days in question time, Minister Peter Reith has endeavoured to bring to the Defence portfolio an absolute lack of any integrity and knowledge about the issues associated with it, which, frankly, I find a little disturbing. One of the features of the relationship which John Moore and I enjoyed as minister and shadow minister, and from what I understand has been successively enjoyed over a long period of time between ministers and opposition spokespeople, was that there was a degree of bipartisanship when it came to defence matters. As I am often quoted as saying as I give speeches to a range of people around this nation of ours when talking on defence matters, I find it important that you do not play politics with national security. What is even more important is that something like 97 per cent of defence issues enjoy that degree of bipartisanship. But on the evidence I have seen in the last couple of days from the new minister, that degree of bipartisanship which we have been prepared to share, as has been the case successively before, seems to be fraying a tad at the edges.  </para><para>I hope the minister gets some advice from his departmental officials and even from his own ministerial office on this issue and understands that, on these matters of great moment in respect of national security and the protection of Australia, the ways in which we can ensure that we have the correct numbers of personnel serving in the Defence Force and the way in which the equipment we buy is going to meet our needs into the next 10 or 20 years will all come unstuck if he continues to play political hard ball. I think he will come grossly unstuck if he goes down the route of the Collins class submarines that he tried in the last couple of days. Instead of bagging out the submarines, he should have listened to what Minister John Moore had to say about it before he left office. He adopted it virtually as the government's own. He should listen to the experts in the Defence Department as to the success that our Collins class submarines have had in trials against the United States Navy—undetected, beating the United States Navy in war games; not only did they talk about them as the best conventionally powered submarines ever but also, once those combat systems are fully operational, we are going to have a piece of kit which will stun the world in terms of its capability. Yet in the last couple of days we have a minister trying to denigrate this great piece of equipment for some cheap political point about costs associated with some promises that may or may not have appeared in an opposition policy manifesto as to whether we are going to acquire another couple of submarines.</para><para>At the end of the day, what we are trying to ensure is the process of defending Australia, providing a Defence Force with appropriate levels of skilled personnel and equipment to do that job, providing the opportunity for the Defence Force not only to participate in the defence of Australia through denial of access through the air-sea gap but also to be involved in peacekeeping operations, working in unison with some major ally like the United States, as we have done in the past, or being involved in a range of things like assistance in flood relief and so on, and of course being involved in policing activities in drug detection, as we have seen with the Fremantle class patrol boats in Northern Australia. That is what we should be talking about and that is what we should be enjoying—a bipartisan approach. As we said after the government's white paper was delivered last year, we did support it. Why wouldn't we? </para><para>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. As I have said, what the government did was simply to go back to what Labor's policy had been in defence for all those years. We walked back from where people like Ian McLachlan were proposing to take us, suggesting that we might have a defence capability that would see Australian men and equipment deployed on the Korean Peninsula or on the Taiwan straits—an approach to defence that a lot of people thought was quite bizarre. What we saw was a rational document come forward and a set of dollars that was about right—still after 10 years in the forward projections it is going to be about 1.9 per cent of GDP, about what it is at the present minute, in line with what Labor would propose, in line with the needs that needed to be addressed for personnel and a whole raft of equipment purchases and acquisitions in the coming years. So let us not get into this nonsense about there being some sort of silence or reticence on Labor's side about embracing defence. Clearly that has not been the case.</para><para>Nevertheless, notwithstanding all of that, there are examples where government mismanagement of the budget for Defence could have been improved. I already alluded to the fact that, in terms of the appropriation bill itself, what we are seeing is an appropriation of additional funds that are going to come from the facilities or equipment budget and be directed to prop up the costs associated with Defence personnel. Under this government, they are making an art form of that. They continue to raid the Defence capital budget to prop up expanding costs associated with personnel. Yet what we saw was a government that, when they came into office in 1996 and inherited a 58,000-strong uniform personnel in the ADF, made a decision through the Defence Reform Program to reduce it down to 42,700 until the situation in East Timor arose and suddenly they realised that maybe we need a few more. As a consequence, they have now drawn the line under 55,000. Yet, because of that, what we have failed to see recognised in terms of the budgetary constraints on the Department of Defence is that personnel costs are going to continue to rise. </para><para>What we saw in the white paper released last December was an actual shortfall in the calculations with regard to personnel funding. My colleague the member for Reid, the Labor Party spokesman on defence science and personnel issues, knows as well as I do, from his discussions around Australia with Defence personnel, that the government are worried about this because the white paper showed that there was a provision for only a two per cent increase in personnel costs, yet they are expected to increase by 4.9 per cent. That is what the white paper says. Where is that magical 2.9 per cent difference going to come from? What we have seen on past performance is that they raid the capital budget. They raid the budget that is there to carry out the necessary upgrade works on much needed defence equipment.</para><para>Of course, what the white paper is also talking about tackling over the next 10 years is this problem of block obsolescence. When the white paper came down people were dazzled by the big numbers—the global budget figure that was going to be there for 10 years—and the photographs of the cyber soldiers with all their latest equipment and what they might have if they were equipped to the fullest extent that was possible. They saw glossy photographs of the new jets that perhaps we were going to acquire—up to 100 new jets for the defence of Australia—the new airborne warning capability for the Navy to replace our ageing destroyers and the new replacements for the Fremantle class patrol boats to carry out the necessary work, particularly in terms of drug interdiction and people-smuggling and so on, which Labor would see as falling more squarely under the responsibility of a coastguard, which we have already announced over 12 months ago as our policy to deal with those sorts of issues. What people have failed to do is to look a little bit behind that. As I have said, if you just take the personnel problem that is there, we see not only a shortfall in terms of funding being made available—which was even identified in the white paper—but also the government still having problems in retaining personnel and recruiting personnel to meet the 55,000 target. Yet we have this new minister come in here and start bagging our submariners and the submarine program—calling them ships instead of boats. I think he had better just get back to his briefing papers for a bit longer before he decides to take it on.</para><para>Then, of course, we have seen a couple of other problems with the Defence budget, as well. Let us take the airborne early warning and control aircraft. It was about September of 1999—perhaps a little later—when I had the opportunity, having been made the opposition spokesman on defence matters, to travel to the United States to talk to people about defence related issues. When I was in Washington I travelled down to Baltimore where I met representatives of the Boeing and Northrop Grumman companies—the two companies that had been chosen as the successful tenderers for the supply of an airborne early warning and control aircraft for Australia. Seven was the figure—we were going to buy seven. When we were going to buy those seven—the contract had to be signed off then and there—we could have got the seven for the price that this genius of a government has now decided we will be able to buy four for. What sort of bargain is that? We are going to pay the same money now because the government procrastinated on buying the seven 18 months ago, and for the same price we are going to get four for. Not only that; had we chosen to go with the seven, the first two would have been manufactured in the United States by Boeing because they are prototypes—the US has not even got them yet; we are going to be the first country to fly this kit—and the other five were going to be assembled in Australia, meaning jobs in Australia, meaning a semblance of some sort of an industry policy and a defence industry policy coming from this government. </para><para>But if you go and talk to people in industry now they just shake their heads. I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago, while the Leader of the Opposition was doing his very successful bus tour to northern New South Wales, to be in Victoria at the Australian international air show. I was talking to leading figures in the Australian defence industry. I am talking about people who come from overseas and the Australian chief executive officers—whether they be with Tenex, EADS, ADI or Thomson, it did not matter; they were all there and they all wanted to talk to us. What they were saying was that there is this concern about the lack of an industry policy, and a defence industry policy in particular, from this government. The AEW&amp;C fiasco is typical of that. It does put strain on the Defence budget because if we are going to acquire this kit that we need—and it is going to give us a tremendous capability; it is going to enable us to protect Australia with fantastic parameters, particularly when you see the sort of radar that is going to be associated with it—the procrastination has meant that this cost blow-out for us is just ridiculous. I raised this in question time today. This issue of the acquisition of this major kit again reflects on this government's ability to handle the tough decisions. </para><para>The defence integrated distribution system is a $1 billion, 10-year program of outsourcing that this government has embraced. It has called for tenders, it has been stringing along a variety of defence industry suppliers and cajoling them and saying to them, `Don't drop out because we want you to be in there; spend all those millions of dollars putting the tender in for us.' It has been giving them a truckload of tender documents that they have to go through because this is a logistics exercise that is going to supply everything from, virtually, toothpaste through to tanks almost, for the Defence Force of Australia, and yet what we have seen is, again, procrastination and delay, but expenditure by the industry to get up to speed to get their tenders in. What we know is that former Minister for Defence Moore had the recommendation come from his department six months ago as to who the successful tenderer should be. But has anything happened? No, it has not. And why? Because it means job losses in regional and rural Australia where Defence Force bases are located and it means job losses for regular Defence Force personnel and their families and it means flow-on effects through the multiplier effect in regional Australia that this government is going to run away from again.</para><para>I alluded to this this afternoon in a question to the minister but he had absolutely no idea—I do not think he knew what DID stands for or stood for. The dogs are barking in the defence industry: the government has decided to pull the plug on this billion dollar program. Again, they are running away, but the people who have spent all of the money on this are expected to cop it. It is like there will be no claims for compensation coming against the government from the companies that have spent millions of dollars to get up to speed in terms of tender documents. If the government walks away, I will not be surprised if these companies decide to take the government on. I hope the budget is prepared for that. If it is not, it means that money that could have been spent on a whole variety of projects around Australia's Defence establishment—such as ensuring our troops on peacekeeping operations in East Timor and Bougainville have kit that is comfortable and can sustain the sorts of tropical conditions in which they find themselves—will not be spent. They will miss out because of the stupidity of the government in not getting on and awarding the contract. Not only will it mean the whole distribution system will be up in the air and more uncertainty amongst people; it means they will have to pay out compensation. </para><para>I shake my head in disbelief that we had a minister in John Moore who decided to take the baseball bat to the department saying, `We have to clean up the financial management of the place', and yet we still have these problems. I said to John Moore, the then minister, on a number of occasions that I did not mind, and no-one would mind, if we were trying to get value for our Defence dollars—bigger bangs for our bucks. That is not a problem and Labor supports that. But, on the evidence presented, we have not seen that happen. Now we have in the new minister someone who, clearly, is not on top of his brief; someone who at this stage—I am prepared for a short period of time to give him the benefit of the doubt— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name></talker><para>—You are too kind.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">Martin, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr MARTIN</name></talker><para>—I know I am kind. However, he is a senior minister in the government and I would have thought, trading as he has done on the few months he spent as the opposition spokesperson for defence, that he might at least have known one or two things about it. I find it startling to think that, with some of these issues about morale, recruitment, defence acquisition, major kit—such as airborne early warning control aircraft—the DID system, a whole range of things, he seems a little off the game. </para></talk.start></continue><para>What needs to be clearly understood, from the opposition's perspective, is that we thought the white paper basically got it about right, and I have said that. We said that in terms of the dollars that that was basically about right and that it was the sort of thing we would do. I think the Minister for Defence was trying to bait the opposition in the last day or two by suggesting we would walk away from the commitments that were in that 10-year strategy plan in the white paper. I have said previously that as far as we are concerned it was about right. The Leader of the Opposition said it was about right. But we still reserve the right, as an incoming government, to have a look at some of those issues that are contained in there. We might find better ways in which to deliver some of those outcomes which do not distract from the basic strategic issues associated with the white paper or the delivery of appropriate defence systems that overcome the problems of block obsolescence that Australia will be faced with anyway. </para><para>I make no apology for that and I do not think anybody would expect anything different. An incoming government always reserves the right to have a look at some of the issues associated with the broader policy outcomes that a previous government has outlined. But the defence white paper is about right. We will certainly need to look at these things on personnel, on some of these shortfalls—how money is being constantly transferred out of the capital budget to prop up the shortfalls that have been identified in personnel. We will have to look at the thousands of dollars that get spent on cancelled conferences and on delegations that get sent away to look at ships, which the minister had already indicated were never going to get off the drawing board and, in fact, were not going to be part of any board proposal that he had in mind. These are issues that need to be addressed but it needs strong leadership in the department; it needs strong leadership in the government. What we are not seeing at the minute is that leadership from government.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>24555</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take the opportunity to discuss some of the major positive aspects that have flowed to my electorate of Barker as a direct result of this government's commitment to people who live in rural and regional Australia. There have been important funding initiatives such as the Roads to Recovery program, the highest ever levels of aged care funding, extra funding for non-government schools and outside school hours care, well-deserved assistance to our veterans and further funds to guarantee ongoing rural crisis counselling—to list just a few. </para></talk.start><para>Last year's announcement by the Prime Minister of a $1.6 billion boost in funding to the nation's road network is the most significant commitment ever made by a federal government to our lifeline of country roads that are so necessary. It is a commitment with the emphasis on investment in the repair and maintenance of our road system and it is over and above existing budget allocations from this government for local roads. As an example, in my own state, in very round figures, the funding from the federal government has gone from $80 million to $180 million, and I can assure everyone in this House that every council is very pleased by that. </para><para>This commitment covers budget allocations for such things as local roads, roads of national importance and national highways and, of the $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion will be distributed directly to local governments through the Roads to Recovery program for local road construction and repair. That is taking the position that local government knows best because they are there on the ground to make those decisions. We provide the funds but they make the decisions as to where that money is spent. I am assured, after speaking to all of the 14 councils in my electorate, that that money will be well spent.</para><para>The Roads to Recovery funding of $1.2 billion over four years represents a massive 75 per cent average increase in current federal government grants for local roads. More important to me and other members in my state is that the increase to every council in the state of South Australia is an even more massive 112 per cent. As I said, the figures are roughly $80 million to roughly $180 million each year for the next four years. On top of that, a further $400 million over four years from 2001-02 will be allocated to national highways and roads of national importance projects to develop key arterial link roads in outer metropolitan areas and regional areas.</para><para>This investment is made possible because of sound economic management of our country's economy by this coalition government. Our budget position is even better than anticipated, so we have made a commitment to give back to our local communities some of the rewards of sound economic management. We believe that Roads to Recovery is one of the best ways to invest these funds for the long-term benefit of the nation. Can I say to those opposite that when I first came into the parliament I was told that spending money on roads does not win votes. That may be the case, but we are not here just to win votes; we are here to do what is necessary. I am a proud member of the Primary Industries and Regional Services Standing Committee of this House, and we put together a report which dealt with needs in the electorates. Certainly roads was a very large factor identified by that committee, and I am very proud that this government has reacted to that committee's report and has been very generous to local councils to ensure that local roads are maintained and built up as they should be.</para><para>This investment is far too important to be used as a political football by our political opponents. To ensure that they do not make allegations that there was some bias in the allocation of funding for local councils within each state—which will not really stop them, because they still make allegations, whether they are true or not—it will be done strictly in accordance with the formula adopted by the States Grants Commission. I might add that this was established and applied under the previous government. So this is an increase on level terms over an existing formula provided by the previous government. Any suggestion by those opposite that this funding would somehow unfairly benefit coalition electorates is totally false. There seems to be a recent phenomenon of the opposition talking about our being out of touch. They think that if they say `out of touch' all the time, people will believe it. But when the Leader of the Opposition talks about this program as being a boondoggle, that would have to be the height of being out of touch with country people. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that no amount of stunt filled bus trips will convince country people that the Leader of the Opposition will ever understand country people. </para><para>As a member for a large country electorate of some 54,000 square kilometres, I particularly appreciate approximately $850 million of that $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program being allocated to country areas like my own. The government recognises that these are the areas of greatest need and that they are the areas that will give the greatest return and greatest result to our economy for our investment. There is absolutely no doubt that local road funding is critical, and nowhere is this more evident than in regional and rural Australia, where much of the local infrastructure was built in the 1950s and 1960s—again under coalition governments, of course. Now they are in urgent need of upgrading. As I travel around my vast electorate, there is not a single place in Barker that cannot identify roads that need fixing. They identify issues such as all-weather access to local towns, allowing school buses to stop at local farmgates and, most importantly, strengthening road bases for the heavy vehicle traffic necessary to transfer our wealth to markets intrastate, interstate and overseas. That is very important in an electorate like mine which has a huge amount of exports. The electorate has something like eight per cent of the population of the state of South Australia but actually produces 40 per cent of the wealth of the state. That is because it is a very highly productive area. As a result, we need those roads to make sure that our produce can get to the markets.  </para><para>In my electorate of Barker, the Roads to Recovery funding for local government has been widespread. For the record, I would like the House to know what those amounts were. The Alexandrina Council, which takes in a fair amount of the Fleurieu Peninsula, south of Adelaide, is very important for tourism as well as industry. It is receiving $1.233 million. Many people relish visiting the beautiful Coorong area. It has a small population but has a large road network which is very much in need of extra funding. They will receive $1.761 million extra. The Grant Council, which surrounds the Mount Gambier township, is quite a large country area. They are receiving $908,000. Kangaroo Island is one of Australia's foremost tourist spots. It receives about 160,000 visitors a year, and 40 per cent of those are from overseas. It is very much in need of improvement to its roads. They are receiving an extra $991,000. I emphasise that all these figures are on top of the existing funding that we already give them. Karoonda-East Murray is an area in the Mallee with a small population but is very productive. That is receiving $818,000 extra. The Lacepede area around Kingston on the coast of South Australia is receiving another $642,000. The Mid Murray Council, very much a Mallee based council, is receiving an extra $1.705 million extra.</para><para>The Mount Gambier City Council—the largest town outside Adelaide with about 23,000 people—will be receiving an extra $939,000. They have some very important roadworks to do there because of the population pressures on the township. The Murray Bridge Rural City Council, where I have my electorate office, will be receiving $1.036 million. The Naracoorte and Lucindale District Council will receive another $1.385 million on top of what they already receive. The Robe District Council will receive nearly $300,000. Southern Mallee District Council—again another Mallee district with a low population but with a large road network—will receive $1.007 million. Tatiara District Council—my own council where I live—receives an extra $1.460 million. The Victor Harbor District Council—I think many people in this House would have heard of Victor Harbor; a very large tourist town which has a large ring route to fund—receives another $521,000. The Wattle Range Council, which takes in the magnificent Coonawarra and Millicent area, receives $1.501 million. Yankalilla District Council, in the south-west of Fleurieu Peninsula, receives an extra $349,000.</para><para>I would assure everyone in this House that every one of those councils is absolutely rapt with this extra funding. It is something that they have been crying out for for years and they know that we are listening to their needs. I certainly believe that, with a growing revenue source flowing to the states as a direct result of the GST, state governments will be able to increase their contribution to local road funding on a par with that of the federal government.</para><para>Another area of major commitment by this coalition government which has been particularly beneficial in the Barker electorate is the increase in real terms of aged care funding. My government is totally committed to ensuring that frail, older Australians have reasonable access to residential and care services at home or in aged care homes. Certainly, we are out there trying to meet their individual needs. In the year 2000 round of funding, 44 per cent of all places were allocated to rural and regional Australia. Unfortunately, the previous government neglected country areas when it came to aged care, which was identified by the report that we commissioned when we came to government. It was really noticeable that the capital funding for country areas was virtually non-existent under the previous government. I am very pleased to announce that 74 per cent of all capital funding has gone to rural and regional Australia. That is more than twice what you would expect on the population because we recognise that capital funding is needed out there in country Australia. </para><para>The year 2000 round had the largest ever allocation of places. This was necessary to make up the 10,000 bed shortfall left by the previous Labor government's cutback as identified by the Auditor-General, a totally independent body. As part of the largest ever allocation Australia-wide, it demonstrates the government's commitment to building a sustainable and accessible aged care system in country Australia. It focuses on quality of care for any individual who may need it. As well, the Commonwealth government provides 60 cents in every dollar spent for Home and Community Care, most commonly known as HACC. Residential care expenditure across Australia has increased from $2.5 billion when we came to government to $3.9 billion this year. That is about a 60 per cent increase in this very important area.</para><para>The recent Productivity Commission report on government services backs up the significant growth in resources devoted to caring for older Australians. Since our first budget in government, we have been committed to increasing funding to this sector and have continued to consolidate and build on those original changes. Commonwealth spending on community aged care packages have increased fivefold from $33 million in 1995-96 to $150 million in 1999-2000. By June 2001, some 24,000 aged care packages will be in operation. I can assure anyone in this House, and anyone else that would care to listen, that the people involved think this is one of the best things that the government has ever done. It allows aged people to stay in their local surroundings, often with their family and surrounded by their friends, and it certainly gives very good value for taxpayer dollars.</para><para>In the year 2000 aged care round, we saw the largest ever release of new aged care places in Australia's history. In South Australia, that amounted to 46.3 places per thousand people in high residential care for those aged over 70 years and 47 places per thousand people in low residential care for those aged over 70. Again, in a significant recognition of the importance of rural and regional Australia, as I said before, 74 per cent of the capital grants went to country areas, greatly exceeding the population target of 30 per cent. As well, 38.6 per cent of HACC services are delivered to country areas and 28 per cent of aged care recipients are in country areas. In Barker, for example—my electorate—the residential aged care funding translates to seven beds at the South East Regional Community Health Service at Mount Gambier, six beds at Pinchunga at Penola and six beds at the Naracoorte Health Service. I was personally congratulated in the street the other day by the person in charge of the Naracoorte Health Service. They were tickled pink. They thought they would be lucky to get two beds, so they were absolutely over the moon when they received six beds. The Murray Mallee Aged Care at Murray Bridge received 15 beds; Mary Cecilia Hart Court Hostel in Millicent received 15 beds; HCS, which is in the Fleurieu, Victor Harbor, received 15 beds; Longridge Retirement Village in Naracoorte received five beds; and Kiama Encounter Bay received 17 beds, plus an extra status of 50. Most importantly—I was very pleased with this because of the amount of the work that I did with the minister and the department— there are over 100 new places on the Fleurieu Peninsula for Port Elliott, Victor Harbor and Yankalilla. </para><para>Last month I was delighted to attend the launch of the Aged Housing Group at Yankalilla. This group put an enormous amount of time and effort into well coordinated funding submissions that drew on resources from both the Commonwealth and state governments. It was a good partnership, as well as a very strong commitment from the Yankalilla District Council which they ought to be proud of. The local community has been absolutely stunned by their success. They will now be able to build a top class facility that will service the aged care needs of not only Yankalilla but also the surrounding areas. I am delighted that they have been awarded funding for 60 beds in their new facility. I would urge all rural communities to follow their well planned example to assist the aged and frail in their community. As well, there will be a new 40-bed facility servicing Port Elliot and Victor Harbor.</para><para>Young people in the electorate of Barker have also been assisted by the government's funding allocations. For example, the Murray Bridge Christian College was awarded $295,000 under the Commonwealth capital grants program. The grant will go towards the construction of a new library—dare I mention the Knowledge Nation—with a storeroom and computer facilities, a special education area and a staff administration area. This will also be designed around a common internal courtyard providing a very pleasant outdoor environment for its students. As well, the Glendale Christian College has been awarded a grant of $790,000 under the Commonwealth grants program. The grant will go towards the relocation of the entire junior school campus which will necessitate the construction of 13 general learning areas, a physical education building, library, administration area and student amenities. The grant will also assist in the purchase of new furniture and equipment.</para><para>Initiatives such as this recognise the demand from the community for improved literacy standards, safe and drug free schools and a greater focus on the quality of teaching. Recognising that family needs in today's world are changing and the need for safe and secure care out of school hours, the coalition government has also committed $52,000. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>24559</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue I want to discuss tonight is the bid by Royal Dutch Shell for Woodside Petroleum. The national interest test that should be applied in the case of the current foreign investment application is that exploration and development of the North West Shelf not be impeded by the conflicting interests of Shell. Those conflicting interests are in Brunei, Oman, Malaysia and Russia—Sakhalin Island. It is critical that, in applying the national interest test under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the government gets it right because, once approval is granted, its influence will be minimal.</para></talk.start><para>The wide ranging opinion of Professor Ian Harper, written for Shell, concludes that there are no national interest issues that require the government to exercise its foreign investment power. Most of it deals with issues that are not critical to the national interest in this case. It is weakest on the single issue that is critical—the national interest test described in my first paragraph. Professor Harper's opinion deals with the issue in a theoretical manner. It does not work through the detail of Shell's conflicting LNG interests or the extra influence Shell would have as operator of the North West Shelf. Instead, we are asked to accept that Shell has no influence where it does not have total control, and that Shell's best interests are served by each of the projects in which it has a stake competing aggressively for new business opportunities, free from any overarching Shell agendas.</para><para>Professor Harper's economic theories are blown apart by a report in a Scottish newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Evening News,</inline> that takes an interest in the world petroleum industry, probably because of its proximity to the North Sea. On Friday, 15 December 2000, it quoted Raoul Restucci, the Chairman of Shell Australia Investments Ltd and the executive of Royal Dutch Shell who is in charge of that company's bid to take over Woodside Petroleum, as saying: </para><quote><para>If Shell wins control after the shareholder vote, probably in late March or April, it will aim to stop Woodside competing directly with Shell, as it has in liquefied natural gas receiving terminals in China and India.</para></quote><para>That is nothing short of a confession that Shell's intentions for Woodside are to stop it competing with Shell's other interests. When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer examine the national interest issues relating to this bid, that statement by the man who is driving Shell's bid should be at the front of their minds. In making its decision on the national interest test, the government should be looking at commercial reality, not economic theory. That is a view backed up by a recent piece of analysis published by Salomon Smith Barney that canvasses the conflicting interests of Shell, including where it `is effectively competing with the North West Shelf project in an initial tender' in China, and concludes:</para><quote><para>We believe the FIRB decision must address the potential for conflicting situations that may be contrary to the North West Shelf or Australia's national interest.</para></quote><para>In the face of this evidence—particularly Mr Restucci's self-confession that Shell has a conflict with the interests of the North West Shelf—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ought to be prepared to say whether they are prepared to act to protect Australia's national interest. To date Shell have not commented publicly on the Restucci statement. They have, however, given very general assurances that Shell's interests would not impede development on the shelf. General assurances by Shell about the project have something of a history, as revealed by Kevan Gosper in his autobiography, co-written by Glenda Korporaal, <inline font-style="italic">An Olympic Life. </inline>Kevan Gosper was once a senior Shell executive. The book tells how, in 1981, Gosper had advised Shell's board that the Australian government was stable and reliable and would not shift the goal posts on issues such as the tax regime and licences. Gosper then goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Just as I arrived back in Australia, the Treasurer, John Howard, announced, with little notice, that he was inviting Shell Australia to sell 25 per cent of its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. The announcement sent shock waves through all international companies based in Australia and raised serious concerns with my shareholders who wondered if I could continue to deliver on the North-West Shelf project.</para><para>I found out that a friend of mine, Sir Peter Derham, was hosting a dinner at the Hilton which Malcolm Fraser was attending. I got myself an invitation to the dinner, sat next to the Prime Minister and gave him a strong serve about his government's announcement about Shell putting 25 per cent of its shareholding on the market. For an international company any decision to float off part of its capital on a local market had to be its own decision, not the government's. There was also a concern that if Shell agreed to this suggestion, any other international company operating in Australia could be faced with a similar request. I told Fraser that if the Government insisted on the sell off, I couldn't guarantee that the North-West Shelf project would go ahead with Shell's involvement. `You are changing the rules, moving the goal posts,' I said. </para><para>Fraser said to me: `What you're saying is, we got it wrong.' I remember replying: `Have you ever, Prime Minister!' He advised me to talk to Howard and other key ministers such as his deputy, Doug Anthony, Billy Snedden, Phillip Lynch and Ian Sinclair. For the next two weeks I practically lived in Canberra, meeting all these ministers and pointing out the importance of having a stable and consistent government policy. I never threatened them—you never threaten government—but I went to great lengths to explain to them the importance of our investment in the North-West Shelf and how Shell may have to rethink the project if it were forced to sell off 25 per cent of its corporate presence in Australia against its wishes. Howard then took the unprecedented decision of suggesting that we both make a joint statement saying that it wasn't a good time to be talking about an international company having more local shareholding but that Shell Australia would endeavour to `augment'—Richard Searby's magic word—local participation in any future resource investments and the matter was dropped.</para></quote><para>Richard Searby is now one of the independent directors of Woodside, so he has moved on—but how far? This story makes two relevant points. The first is that Shell are past masters at using nebulous phrases to give meaningless and unenforceable assurances about the company's future intentions in relation to the project. The second is John Howard's previous foreign investment policy failure in relation to the project, a failure in terms of both policy development and implementation.  </para><para>The question is: what options are available to the government short of rejecting the application to ensure the national interest is protected? To do that, the government must consider what additional influence Shell would have on the joint venture. When a $440 billion company makes a bid for control of a $10 billion company, it is not a merger; it is a takeover. If Shell's bid is successful, it will transfer substantial assets and liabilities into Woodside and lift its stake from the current 34 per cent to 60 per cent. Shell's direct 16.7 per cent interest and the 16.7 per cent interest of this 60 per cent Shell subsidiary will give it one-third of the votes in the North West Shelf joint venture.</para><para>But what is more important than its substantial minority interest is that Woodside is the North West Shelf operator and that, in acquiring the operatorship, Shell gets a degree of influence that goes well beyond its percentage interest. It will control the information and processes for managing the project. This is a sensitive matter for the non-Shell joint venture partners, and it should be for the government. The chairman of Shell Australia and the CEO of Shell Development Australia recognised this sensitivity in an email I received two weeks ago saying:</para><quote><para>Shell has indicated its willingness to enter into discussions with its joint venture partners in the NWS to review post-merger governance arrangements, if these are required to give further assurances. </para></quote><para>Changes to governance arrangements could range from window dressing to the substantial, and need to satisfy both the joint venture partners and the government. I would put any commitments to an independent chairman and a substantial minority of independent directors on the Woodside board in the category of window dressing. After all, it would be Shell, with a 60 per cent stake, who would appoint the majority of the board. These and other changes to the various formal and less formal operating arrangements might offer some comfort, but will doubtless come under great pressure sooner or later, particularly if there are further attempts to concentrate ownership. </para><para>Given how fluid these commercial arrangements can be and how little capacity the government has to police the national interest implications of future changes, it should be very wary of propositions in these areas. There have been reports that more than one of the non-Shell partners want to ensure the operator remains independent. If that is being put to the government from within the joint venture, then that is something it should take very seriously.</para><para>In deciding whether there are satisfactory conditions it could impose to protect the national interest, the government must ensure that they will be effective, including in the face of possible future changes to the ownership arrangements. If the government cannot devise an effective set of conditions that are acceptable to Shell, or if the company is unable or unwilling to amend its application to satisfy the national interest test, Shell should be told to withdraw its application, to avoid rejection. The only thing that can save the government from these difficult decisions is a white knight, preferably an Australian white knight, who does not have the conflicting interests that Shell has and is prepared to give the shareholders full value.</para><para>Since this is a debate on appropriations legislation, I would also like to talk about the state of the budget. Since I last had the opportunity to speak in this place on the state of the Commonwealth budget, the government has released its midyear economic and fiscal outlook. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table that shows the effect of policy decisions made by this government up to the 2000 midyear review and a table that shows how, over the Treasurer's first five full budget years, the reduction in net debt is expected to be $52.2 billion, of which $50.3 billion will be derived from asset sales.</para><para>Leave granted. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The documents read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>NET IMPACT OF POLICY DECISIONS 1996 TO 2000 ON OUT-YEARS

In the midyear review of its budget, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration said that the Commonwealth's fiscal outlook has strengthened since the 2000-01 budget. The expected underlying cash surplus for 2000-01 has increased by $1.5 billion to $4.3 billion, with a revised fiscal surplus of $8.4 billion. This improvement was entirely as a result of parameter changes—that is, changes that are not the result of explicit policy decisions of government but rather the drivers of revenue and expenses that result from existing policies such as economic growth, inflation, wages, employment levels, and the number of Centrelink beneficiaries. Assumptions about strengthening revenue added more than $4 billion. Expenses grew by almost $1 billion and net capital investment was adjusted by almost $400 million. The effect of the government's policy decisions made since the budget was handed down, however, had quite the opposite effect on the budget's bottom line. Policy decisions taken between the budget and the midyear review weakened the budget bottom line by more than $2 billion over the remainder of this financial year and the three out years.  </para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>24562</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

It will be a day when the community learns about what is happening in their local public schools and colleges and the challenges being faced on a daily basis by both students and teachers. Public Education Day is supported by peak parent bodies, principal organisations and the Teachers Federation. It is a unique opportunity to learn about our great public education system and to say thankyou to the school communities in our local areas. </para></talk.start><para>On 15 March, public schools and colleges will be involved in a number of activities. Morning teas will be held with the parents and citizen organisations and students in the local schools to tell the community about the great things that are happening in their schools. Barbecue lunches will be held for community members and new parents. A number of theme days such as grandparents day and generation day will be held, inviting parents and prominent ex-pupils to the schools and out into the community. There will also be performing arts groups and fitness displays. The purpose of these activities is to tell the community about what is happening in their community. The member for Braddon has told me that he also will be involved in his local area. It is a great idea, and I will be joining with the teachers, students and parents from one of my local high schools—Belmont High School, the school my children went to—and I can attest to the high standard of education, the dedication of the teachers and the supportiveness of the school community. </para><para>Why have our public schools and colleges declared 15 March Public Education Day? One reason is of course to tell people about what is happening in our schools and to share their achievements with the community. But I also believe that the public education institutions in our communities are under threat from this government. This government has directed money towards private schools and private colleges and has reinforced the private system at the expense of the public system. For instance, the enrolment benchmark has devastated public schools. We have 70 per cent of students attending public schools and 30 per cent of students attending private schools, yet this government delivered a bonanza to the 61 richest schools in this country—the category 1 schools. What have they done since they received this bonanza? They have hiked up the fees. They have put the fees up in their schools. This government is working towards a two-tiered education system, just the way it has worked towards a two-tiered public health system. Its approach to education is that, if you have money, you pay for it and you deserve to get a quality education. For the normal, ordinary, average Australian who relies on the public system, this government is punishing those students in the public system. So the teachers, the school communities and students feel that they need to get their message out into the community, to share with the community the wonderful things that they are doing and to ask for the support of the community.</para><para>Whenever I visit one of our outstanding public schools or colleges, I am overwhelmed by the achievements of the teachers, students, parents and other volunteers. The commitment of our teachers to our children—the students—is wonderful. The tragedy is that this great public education system is under threat from this mean, miserable government. I call on all members to contact their local public schools and colleges on 15 March and show their support for the achievements of these fine and outstanding institutions. Join with them, support the community, support the students and support the teachers.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kalgoorlie Electorate: Mining Operations</title><page.no>24563</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>24563</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to bring to the attention of the House a survey currently being conducted by Western Mining to determine the future of the town of Leinster in Western Australia—not something that we hear a great deal about these days but, unfortunately, a common occurrence in Western Australia. Mining operations and the development of resources in the Kalgoorlie electorate in Western Australia were so often achieved by the establishment of towns and all the infrastructure that goes with that. Since 1984, and the decimating FBT introduced by the ALP, we have seen companies move more and more to an arrangement of a fly-in fly-out work force. This fly-in fly-out work force has taken not just the wealth from towns but, more than that, the heart from towns. This arrangement has taken away their character; it has destroyed the critical mass necessary to provide all of the infrastructure necessary for a community to exist. Sporting clubs have been decimated, volunteer fire brigades have been destroyed, the St John Ambulance can no longer be staffed and swimming pools no longer have attendants and have to close. There is no end to the destruction caused by the introduction of FBT into remote area mining developments—in particular, its effect on the provision of remote area housing.  </para></talk.start><para>Thank goodness this government has had the good sense to revoke the effect of FBT on all employer provided houses in remote areas. But it seems that this is not enough. Having had the opportunity to cast the net of employment extremely widely and employ people who are now cosily residing along the coast in primarily city areas, we now have created a situation whereby people believe that they will enjoy a career in the mining industry but will no longer have to live in remote Australia and endure its rigours.</para><para>The downside of this, however, is that families are without one of the parents for extended periods of time. The partner remaining at home has to carry the sole responsibility of looking after the domestic situation and looking after the upbringing of children. Furthermore, children often voice the opinion that they are sick of seeing one of their parents only occasionally. I believe that children deserve to have the influence of both parents in their developing years. The arrangements of fly-in, fly-out workforces do not provide for this. More and more I am hearing that welfare agencies are being pressured by the results of fly-in, fly-out—the destruction of domestic situations. More and more I am hearing from mine managers who speak of the increased discontent of employees because they are away from their spouse for extended periods of time.</para><para>There is a remote possibility that one way—after having dangled the carrot for so long on this issue—to rectify this is to use a little stick. Perhaps it would be interesting to see the effects of applying a fringe benefits tax to those costs apportioned to the airfares of employees flying in and flying out of workplaces. It may bring to an end, once and for all, the practice of having communities decimated in the bush.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: National Service</title><page.no>24564</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>24564</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Sunday 18 February I had the great pleasure of sharing the speakers dais with Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove at Longford in Tasmania in the beautiful electorate of Lyons.

It was in every sense of the word `national service': young men were conscripted, their lives were changed and some, unfortunately, lost their lives. In all, some 287,000 national serviceman trained for, and served, their nation. </para><para>There were two main periods of national service between 1951 and 1972 and each of these surrounded real and/or perceived threats to our national interest. Between 1951 and 1959, it was in the context of the Cold War, the Communist victory in China, the Malay situation of 1948 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. It was designed to build up our depleted forces after World War II, to raise a force of partially trained men and `to improve physical fitness and the discipline of young men'. Between 1951 and 1957, about 33,000 young men per annum trained—all but 5,000 in the Army—in effect, spending something like three months in training and then three years in the CMF. In 1957, universal obligation was abolished and replaced with a selective training system which was eventually abolished in 1959.  </para><para>In 1965, events in South-East Asia and, of course, closer, including New Guinea, saw a reactivation of the previous system, with conscripts being liable for overseas service. Apart from these strategic considerations, it was a time of full employment and recruitment figures were allegedly low. Selection for military service was by ballot—variously dubbed `Russian roulette' and `the birthday ballot'. Between 1965 and 1972 over 800,000 registered for national service. Of these, 64,000 were called up, 19,500 served in Vietnam alongside 21,000 `regs', 200 were killed with 1,279 non-fatal casualties alongside 242 regulars killed and 1,500 non-fatal casualties. National service was abolished on 5 December 1972.</para><para>Over 287,000 men had their lives interrupted, spent time and effort to be trained and were on call to defend their country. Some 200 died in service and over 1,200 were injured. They deserve our thanks. Whatever their views were on national service—and many supported and enjoyed it—they were conscripted for training in peacetime. Their lives were in the hands of others—they had no choice. They did their job and many found fellowship in each other's company, especially with the formation of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia in 1987—in my home state in 1995.</para><para>But their compulsory service is not formally recognised by this nation. This is not politics; this is a fact—a fact I raised before in the federal parliament in May 1999 after I learned of the situation. In 1998, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said—and it has since been reiterated right up until recently:</para><quote><para>National service was no more demanding than normal peacetime service and does not, in its own right, warrant the award of a medal.</para></quote><para>But normal peacetime service is voluntary—national service was compulsory. National servicemen had no choice, but serve they did at the behest of their government and their nation. The National Servicemen's Association's request to have national servicemen's compulsory service recognised by the issue of an Australian Service Medal with a clasp for national servicemen has been rejected. Yet there is no real reason why it should be. I believe that members on both sides of the House should support their call. Many others get formal recognition for far less. Their call should be accepted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Farm Forestry</title><page.no>24565</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24565</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to talk briefly about farm forestry. As we know, farm forestry is about incorporating commercial tree growing into conventional farming systems to enhance and diversify agricultural production and farm income and also to improve the health of our natural systems. Farm forestry can take many forms and is widely recognised for its potential role in responding to the economic, environmental and social challenges that face many areas in rural and regional Australia. These challenges are the increasing impact of dryland salinity, the declining water quality of many inland river systems, the loss of native vegetation and biodiversity in our landscape, and also the steady fall in some areas of farm and rural sector incomes.</para></talk.start><para>In our country of Australia there is an imperative to develop farm forestry systems that contribute not only towards natural resource management and forestry capacity generally but towards conservation objectives as well, to complement commercial timber production. To do so, we need to ensure that our farm forestry managers have the guidance and training to look after that shared objective of providing for commercial timber production as well as securing conservation outcomes. To deliver that, I was pleased to represent the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, at the table, Dr Sharman Stone, at the launch of the National Graduate Program in Farm Forestry at the ANU yesterday. That program is designed to ensure that our farm forestry managers have the horsepower, talent, knowledge and expertise not only to enhance the commercial timber production capacity offered by farm forestry but also, in a complementary way, to secure conservation objectives. </para><para>The federal government has contributed $45,000 from the Natural Heritage Trust's Bushcare program to support the development of this national graduate program. That Bushcare became involved is recognition that farm forestry can play a role in reversing the decline in the quality and extent of Australia's native vegetation. It can help to restore, through revegetation, the environmental values and productive capacity of our degraded land and water systems. The program is the work of the ANU's Professor Peter Kanowski and Jim Pratley from Charles Sturt University, who have put a lot of time into developing this program. It is actually available as an external studies online course. It involves a number of units and I will briefly run through those: the sustainable management of native forests; the planning and design of farm forestry plantations—not only to secure the timber production opportunities that farm forestry presents but to conserve some of the biodiversity values in the area where the plantations are being established—how to assess the regional benefits and the economic viability of farm forestry so that advice can be provided to the land-holders on how best to pursue farm forestry as part of an integrated farm management plan; how to assess the flora and fauna biodiversity in the area where the plantation is to be established; and how to measure trees and forests. Some people might think, `What is measuring trees and forests about?' It is important to recognise that many land-holders have the real estate to support the establishment of farm forestry but not necessarily the capital to set up the crop in the first place. Where you bring in external investors to facilitate the establishment of farm forestry, those investors are wanting to know that their asset is valued, secure and being enhanced through sound farm forestry practice.</para><para>Also, in measuring the forest itself, we know that forestry generally, and farm forestry in particular, has a particular contribution to make in the sequestration of carbon. Our greenhouse responsibilities require us to look at opportunities to withdraw carbon from the atmosphere as part of our responsibilities under the Kyoto protocol, and farm forestry can play a role there. But we need to be serious about measuring the role that forestry plays. We do not want to go off to other parties to the protocol and say our farm forestry productions have achieved this and that but we cannot actually measure it.</para><para>This new national graduate program is a really thoughtful and sensitive response to commercial barriers where, if we cannot demonstrate sustainable forestry practice, we have difficulty getting our timber production into the marketplace. It recognises the investment culture that is supporting the expansion of farm forestry. It is also recognising that enhanced farm forestry management can play a role in greenhouse abatement strategies. So I commend the ANU and Charles Sturt University on this initiative and encourage anybody that wants to be at the leading edge of farm forestry into the future to make sure they are tooled up with the best possible knowledge, and we will be certain that the farm forestry managers in Australia will be world class as a result of the graduate program launched yesterday. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Sydney Airport: Sydney West</title><page.no>24566</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>24566</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's announcement to expand Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and make Bankstown Airport an overflow airport for jet aircraft raises serious questions about the operation of the Airports Act 1996. On 6 February 2001 I asked a series of questions on notice about this matter and I draw your attention to question No. 2305. Yesterday I asked a further series of questions under No. 2374 that deal directly with this central issue. </para></talk.start><para>What is the central issue? The issue concerns the operation of specific provisions of the Airports Act in light of the government's decision. In particular, I draw to the House's attention the provisions of sections 11 to 22 inclusive of the act. In particular, section 18 of the act is entitled, `Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport are to be under common ownership'. Section 18 says that `under a grant of lease under this Act or under section 22 of the Airports (Transitional) Act' the Commonwealth `must not grant an airport lease under section 13 of this Act, or under section 22 of the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996, for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport or Sydney West airport unless each of the airport lessee companies is a subsidiary of the same company'.</para><para>This raises a number of questions that pose difficulty for the government if it intends to implement the proposal it has put to the people. I use the word `proposal' guardedly. A `proposal' is a prescribed term that is submitted by a `proponent' under Commonwealth environmental protection law. In this case the Department of Transport and Regional Services is the proponent to the Sydney West airport proposal known as Badgerys Creek airport. Badgerys Creek airport, in turn, was the result of a two-site selection process conducted in the mid-1990s between the Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek sites. To date Badgerys Creek is the designated site for Sydney West airport and, notwithstanding a supplementary environmental impact statement, Badgerys Creek remains the designated proposal for Sydney West airport.</para><para>That is what makes this government's rhetoric on Bankstown airport as an `overflow' airport so inconsistent with the act. Bankstown airport is not Sydney West airport. However, it is clear that the statutory intent is that each of the airport lessee companies, or owners, of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Sydney West airport must be a subsidiary of the same company. So what does this mean in practice? The objective of placing an airport in Western Sydney is to relieve persons affected by aircraft noise from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </para><para>I say again that, as at today, Badgerys Creek remains the proposal for the Sydney West airport. This is the reason why I support an airport there. It is because, in light of the act, if we do not support the statutory proposal as assessed under a full environmental impact statement, a number of serious statutory implications may result. And what are those statutory implications? A reading of the second reading speech by the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, for what became the act reveals that it was never intended that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport be sold until that airport's noise problems were solved. The solution to the noise problems as devised by this government are twofold: (1) develop a new, 24-hour international airport in Western Sydney; and (2) implement the long-term operating plan by implementing both noise sharing flight modes and respite periods.</para><para>The impact of the decision to sell Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport alone is that it makes ambiguous the operation of the granting of a lease to the lessee of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport at a time when Sydney West airport does not as yet exist. The question I put to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Attorney-General is: what is the statutory operation of section 18 and related provisions of the act in light of this fact? My question goes to the temporal nature of this provision—that is, must the sale of the 50-year lease for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport be contemporaneous with the sale of a lease for Sydney West airport? If not, how is the act to be read?</para><para>I put to the minister that any reading of the act other than by grant of contemporaneous granting of both leases creates interpretational and administrative difficulties in the operation of the act as it presently stands. In particular, if we believe what the then Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, said in his second reading speech of the Airports Act 1996—as I read out in this House on 8 February 2001—the act was clearly designed to protect the people of Sydney from adverse aircraft noise impacts from Sydney airport by delaying the sale until the long-term operating plan is fully implemented. To achieve this, the government hard-wired the lease of Sydney airport to Sydney West airport in the act, thus affording statutory security for residents affected by noise from Sydney airport. A reading of the provisions of the act and the minister's second reading speech of the Airports Act clearly demonstrates this.  </para><para>However, the recent decisions of the government for Sydney and Bankstown airports require a contorted interpretation if the purpose of the act is not to be breached altogether—that is, in the leasing of Sydney (Kingsford- Smith) Airport alone before Sydney West airport is built and the long-term operating plan fully implemented. For this reason, I call upon the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Attorney-General to immediately shed light to this House as to how the Airports Act 1996 is supposed to operate without alteration, in light of the government's intentions for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Bankstown airport. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: National Service</title><title>Barker Electorate: Government Grants</title><page.no>24568</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>24568</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I go into what I was prepared to say, can I give my support to what the member for Braddon was saying earlier. I think there is no doubt that we should be giving recognition to our national service people, whoever they were. I think it was quite disgraceful how especially our Vietnam veterans were treated when they came home. They were not welcomed back, and I believe that they were the only group that fought for this country who were not. Whether we believed it was a right or wrong fight, they should still have been welcomed back home in the proper way instead of having to wait 10 years for the welcome home parades. There is no doubt that it was because of the politics of the time—the fact that we had a Whitlam government at the time of the Vietnam war—that these national servicemen who served in Vietnam were disgracefully treated. One of the few things we can do is support what the member for Braddon suggested.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things that we need to recognise as parliamentarians is that family needs in today's world are changing and there is a need for safe and secure care for children out of school hours. The coalition has recognised this and has committed $52,000 to an out-of-school-hours care program that goes across South Australia, with a fair hunk of that going to my electorate of Barker. Funding for an extra 75 places in out-of-school-hours care has been granted to Victor Harbor and Yankalilla. I was very much personally involved in the Yankalilla case, where funding of $2,055 was provided to the Yankalilla Primary School as a one-off grant for the purchase of play equipment and educational resources. A further $7,755 will be granted annually over a two-year period to assist with the establishment of that service. The funding will also help provide for another 30 vacation care places. The Victor Harbor reception to year 7 school was granted a one-off equipment and set-up grant of $3,544, and it will receive a recurrent establishment grant of $13,377 for two years to provide for another 45 vacation care places. In terms of a huge government budget, these are only small amounts, but I can assure everyone in this House that they are very warmly received by the families that make use of those facilities. These areas were identified as being of high need, and the funding is in recognition of the demands of work and family and the need for access to affordable and quality child-care services. </para><para>The elderly of the same region also received assistance with a grant awarded under the veterans and community grants scheme of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In December, a grant of $29,751 was awarded to the City of Victor Harbor for the Southern Communities Transport Scheme. There is no public transport there, just as there is not in nearly all rural and regional areas in my electorate. Certainly, this was very welcome, because the grant aided the purchase of an extra vehicle to allow the Southern Communities Transport Scheme to improve and extend their service to veterans and their spouses and to widows or widowers. This is a scheme that provides a very important and much needed service to our veterans and their families from Goolwa, through to Port Elliot to Victor Harbor. Medi Ride provides transport for people to and from medical appointments both locally and in Adelaide, alongside its sister program, Dial a Ride, a community bus service which transports people to businesses and services in Victor Harbor. I would like to congratulate all those involved in this service for their success in obtaining this grant. </para><para>Finally, I would like to draw attention to the ongoing commitment that this government is giving to rural financial counselling services. Areas from Kangaroo Island, through the Mallee and the south-east of South Australia have all received extra ongoing funding to continue their services at least until June 2002. In the case of the South East Rural Counselling Service, that funding amounts to $100,000 for the 12 months from the middle of this year. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

That is why the Government is providing $5.5 million to Reconciliation Australia (the successor to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation) to help ensure that the momentum for reconciliation is maintained.  In addition, the Government has agreed that contributions to the new foundation will be fully tax-deductible.  However, the Government does not support calls for a treaty.  It is concerned that a treaty would create legal uncertainty and result in greater recourse to litigation (by both indigenous and non-indigenous parties) to try to define and clarify the terms of the treaty.  The Government also believes that the concept of a treaty remains a divisive issue and will not solve the real issues confronting indigenous Australians, such as social and economic disadvantage.  The Government believes that practical and effective measures that address this legacy of disadvantage are the cornerstone of true reconciliation.
