After attending Scotch College, Mr McLeay enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1941 and served in New Guinea as a gunner with the 13 Field Regiment Royal Australian Artillery from 1942 to 1943. He joined the Liberal-Country League, later the Liberal Party, in 1940 and was elected to the Unley City Council, where he served from 1949 to 1970, including a period as mayor from 1961 to 1963. </para><para>In 1966 Mr McLeay succeeded his father, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, the late Sir John McLeay, as the federal member for Boothby and he continued to represent that division in this parliament until his retirement in 1981. During his federal parliamentary career John McLeay held several portfolios, including Assistant Minister to the Minister for Civil Aviation, Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. He also served as Minister for Administrative Services in the Fraser government from 1978 to 1980. As Minister for Construction, he gave great support to the preserving and restoring of some of the most significant Commonwealth owned historic properties. He devoted himself to a wide range of political issues beyond his portfolio responsibility as a minister. He was regarded as controversial by some for the views he held, particularly on foreign affairs issues, in particular his position on South Africa and the then Rhodesia, and he participated in many heated debates in the House on those matters. </para><para>He resigned from parliament in 1981 and was appointed Australia's Consul General to Los Angeles from 1981 to 1983. During this time he founded the Australian-American Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. For this he received a special commendation from the United States Secretary of State. He also did much in this period to build the business relationship between Australia and California and the United States as a whole.</para><para>John McLeay was very active in the South Australian community, where he founded the Unley Senior Citizens Club and enthusiastically supported both handicap and pensioner organisations. Aside from his political career, John McLeay was a highly successful businessman, founding the family business of McLeay and Sons Carpets in Adelaide, a firm which still operates today. He showed strong leadership qualities, demonstrating highly ethical standards in both his business and his political career. </para><para>As members will know, a state memorial service, attended by a number of our colleagues, was held at Scotch College on 12 January 2001. To his wife, Clythe, their three sons, Travis, Robin and Digby, and their families, I extend, on behalf of myself, the Liberal Party of Australia, of which John McLeay was a very faithful, long serving member, and the parliament, our very deepest sympathy on his death.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>23875</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I want to support those words of the Prime Minister on the death of the Hon. John Elden McLeay, a former minister of the McMahon and Fraser governments. He was born into a world of politics, both his father and uncle being federal politicians. He was first elected to parliament, as the Prime Minister said, in 1966 for Boothby, succeeding his father who had held the seat for over 16 years. For over 30 years the people of Boothby were represented by a McLeay, and that is a remarkable record. He was a controversial political figure, as the Prime Minister alluded to. That spotlighted his views on a number of matters during the course of the 1970s. Needless to say, those views did not receive wholehearted support on this side of the House.  </para></talk.start><para>He held several portfolios during his time as a minister, being first appointed to the ministry in 1971 in the McMahon government as the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Civil Aviation. In 1975 Mr Fraser appointed him Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. In 1978 he was appointed Minister for Administrative Services, as well as retaining his position as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, and he held those portfolios until 1980, retiring in 1981. For a period of time in the late 1970s he was the only South Australian minister in the Fraser government and was identified as the South Australian spokesperson within it for that period of time. As Minister for Construction, as the Prime Minister has said, he paid particular attention to the issues of preservation and restoration of important Commonwealth historic properties. He also had responsibility for fighting for funding for new developments, including the establishment of the Australian Antarctic Division headquarters in Hobart. I would like to offer, on behalf of the opposition, our sincere condolences to his wife, Clythe, and to his family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>23876</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to add my comments to this condolence motion. John McLeay was educated at Scotch College, Adelaide, in the heart of the electorate of Boothby. While at school, he captained the teams for cricket, athletics and football. As has already been mentioned, he followed his father and his uncle into federal parliament. He also followed his father as Mayor of Unley. He served as the federal member for Boothby from 1966 until 1981. In his maiden speech, he touched on issues of Australia's security and aged care and referred humorously to following his father into parliament. He did not mention his father by name but congratulated the previous Speaker for his long service and mentioned that:</para></talk.start><quote><para>While he was Mayor of Unley, he put forward a similar suggestion to my federal member, but I found myself in conflict with him on this matter.

He was controversial for his remarks on socialism, communism and Rhodesia and held those views with great conviction. I first met John McLeay five years ago, well after his public life had ceased. He worked actively in the family business until recently. I treasure the time I had with John McLeay, having had the opportunity every three or four months to meet with Harold Young, Jim Forbes and John McLeay at a regular lunch meeting at the Kent Town Hotel. I know that they will miss him and I will miss him as a source of advice. John McLeay had a longstanding friendship with former defence minister Jim Killen which went on long after their time in parliament. John and Clythe would often visit Jim Killen and spend some time with him in Queensland.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>23876</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to add a few words to this condolence motion. I did not know John McLeay very well but I did know him a little. He was a fine member of the Liberal Party in South Australia and, before that, the Liberal Country League. As the Prime Minister said, he served as the member for Boothby from 1966 until 1981. He certainly was always a man of strong principles and beliefs. He was deeply anticommunist. He was also a very strong opponent of socialism and was never afraid to speak out in support of the values he believed in. He was a supporter of Australia's participation in the Vietnam War. That was a very controversial view to hold, particularly towards the end of the 1960s and into the early 1970s, but he never wavered in his belief—whether or not people share it today is another thing—that that was a just war to stop the spread of communism through South-East Asia.</para></talk.start><para>When John McLeay retired in 1981 to take up the position of Consul General in Los Angeles was when I first became involved in politics, contesting the preselection for Boothby, which I did not win. However, we have a very fine member for Boothby now, as we did before in the person of Steele Hall. John McLeay's family served that part of Adelaide extraordinarily well for a very long period. John McLeay will be very much missed by many people in and around Adelaide, in the business community and in the political community. I extend my condolences to his wife and to his three sons. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>23877</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to briefly add my comments to those already made.

I knew his wife and his sons and would like to add my own words of condolence to them.

During that time, he served as a minister in the Fraser government and, subsequently, on the election of the government that I have the honour to lead, he served as a senior cabinet minister in two portfolios. In those two portfolios—namely, Industry and Defence—he made a significant policy impact. The role he played in restoring confidence to Australian industry, along with other senior ministers in the government after our election in 1996, is widely appreciated within business circles in Australia. He played a significant part in the development of the government's motor vehicle manufacturing policies in 1997 that resulted in the retention within Australia of a strong motor vehicle manufacturing industry which is of particular importance to the states of South Australia and Victoria. </para></talk.start></continue><para>More recently John served as Minister for Defence. At the end of last year we unveiled the white paper, which is the most constructive blueprint this country has seen for defence policy for a quarter of a century. That white paper announced significant increases in financial support and, as a result, there is a widespread view within the service community that at long last defence is being given the money and priority it has long deserved, and John Moore can take a great deal of credit for the part that he played in putting that white paper, and the policy that underpins it, together.</para><para>I also record my thanks to John for the contribution that he made to the organisational activities of the Liberal Party, particularly the Queensland division. He was president of the Queensland division on two separate occasions. He was president at the time of the Fraser government's election in 1975 and he was subsequently recalled—if I can put it like that—to the party colours in 1983 at a particularly difficult time for the Liberal Party in Queensland, after the break-up of the state coalition in the early 1980s. That of course was a period of time when there was not only the inevitable contests between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party but also considerable difficulties between the two coalition parties, particularly at a state level.</para><para>John gave great service to the Liberal Party and I record my great thanks to him and to his wife, Johnnie, for the contribution they made. I wish both of them well and I am sure, in different ways, he will continue to make a very strong contribution to the Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>23878</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If I may have your indulgence, Mr Speaker, on the same matter, I suppose the resignation of John Moore as member for Ryan is well known, so the time has come when we may praise him, and we note the deep relief that was evident in his comments the other day that he no longer felt personally responsible for the Liberal Party in Queensland. Indeed, it must be a considerable burden lifted from his shoulders and, with that, we can entirely sympathise with him.</para></talk.start><para>He has had a long and distinguished career in this place, having been elected in 1975; so his service has been approximately three and a bit times the average service of a member of parliament in this place. He has also been very active in affairs outside the parliament. He was a stockbroker and company director before entering parliament and served as a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange. He has been a member of the Australian National University Council, a member of the Anti-Cancer Council of Queensland, a member of the Queensland Festival of Arts Board and a former chairman of the Freedom from Hunger campaign. I guess we will never know whether he played tennis at Wimbledon. That is the one question mark over his career that remains unresolved at the conclusion of it!</para><para>He was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Fraser government, and Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and then Minister for Defence in the Howard government. As somebody who has had some degree of responsibility at one point in his own life writing a defence white paper, and who has had some understanding of the Defence portfolio, I know it is indeed a difficult task and he acquitted himself well. He produced a good white paper—and I say it is a good white paper because, despite all appearances to the contrary, prior to its delivery, it has followed, essentially, the lines of the white papers produced by me and then by Senator Ray when he was Minister for Defence. And I might say that before John Moore got hold of it a very different outcome looked likely. So I express my personal gratitude to the former minister for his performance in that regard. </para><para>He was, as the Prime Minister said, obviously a good party man. His self-sacrificial way of going at a time that was a high point in his political career represents that. He understood thoroughly the need to encase the embattled member for Flinders in a tank and his disappearance at this point of time has enabled that to be done. We wish him well in his retirement. We know that he will enjoy his retirement enormously. We will miss him in question time. He had a unique way of answering questions in this place: so opaque was it, suffice to say that it brought every attack to a juddering halt. There has been no-one else in our experience quite like that. We have had plenty of people fail to answer the questions asked of them but we have had very few who have not answered the question at all. That is, as I said, a unique style that will be missed. We know he will enjoy his retirement, and he goes with the good wishes of the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>In conclusion, I join the Prime Minister in his remarks about the situation of the minister for finance. We wish him well in what must be an extraordinarily difficult period in his life and for his family. I am sure it has come as a total shock to all of us that he finds himself in this situation.

As I said this morning, one has to distinguish between payments and reporting. In relation to quarterly payments, the system of quarterly payments has to continue, obviously, otherwise you would not have money for the states. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition then went out and endorsed the system of quarterly payments. He said, `They would be paying quarterly'—and we agree with that—`they could do it on the basis of the average established in one of those payments, the final of those payments.' What he seemed to be saying is that you pay quarterly. His idea was that you would just take off last year's return. There is only one problem: there is no last year's return on GST, a point that was made to him by John Laws. John Laws said, `Is Peter Costello misleading the people by saying there are no past estimates for them to work on?' The Leader of the Opposition made this statement, basically conceding that I was again right on that point—that there are no past estimates. He said this: `The past estimates will be created by the next BAS statement. You will actually have a year's worth of BASs.' You will not have a year's worth of BASs by the next statement because the next statement is due in April but you will have it by June. So he got that wrong. He said that you will have a year's worth of BASs by the next statement, by June. Essentially, what he is saying is that it has to be done quarterly and, what is more, in the first year—the transitional year—you cannot go off a previous year's statement, so you will actually have to do at least four quarterly returns in the transitional year. That is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. </para></talk.start><para>I thought that it was more revealing for this point. I want to explain, when you take a policy-lazy position, the trouble that you get yourself into. Suppose next year that you were to take your quarterly payments off this year's return; suppose next year, in the financial year 2001-02, you were to take your payments off the returns that have to be done this year. It would only work on the basis that the GST base was the same. If you had a rolled-back GST in 2001-02, how could you use the quarterly payments on 2000-01? You would be paying on the current base in respect of a whole new rolled-back GST. The one thing you cannot do in 2001-02 is use this year's return whilst rolling back your base. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Beazley</name></talker><para>—I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker.

I am pleased to confirm to the House that last week I announced on behalf of the government a group of measures, worth almost $3 billion over a period of five years, which represents the largest commitment ever made by any Australian government to science and innovation. These initiatives are, of course, underpinned by a strong economy: no initiative in an area like this can hope to work effectively unless it is underpinned by a strong economy. One of the things that this government set out to do on election was to create very strong economic conditions and we have been successful in doing that over the last five years. The reforms that we have implemented have given us high growth, higher productivity and low inflation.</para></talk.start><para>I want to record my thanks to the members of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, particularly the Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham, and also the many other representatives of the academic and scientific community who sit on that council. It has been the source of very regular advice to me on matters relating to science, education and innovation. The aims of our strategy are to strengthen our research base, accelerate commercial applications and develop and retain Australian skills. The measures I announced included a doubling, through the addition of $736 million to the Australian Research Grants program, $246 million to upgrade university infrastructure, $176 million to create two centres of excellence—one in information and communications technology, another in biotechnology—major changes to the R&amp;D concessions, including the introduction of a premium rate for additional research and development of 175 per cent, and, very importantly, an increase by no less than 80 per cent in the volume of money from the federal government going to the collaborative research programs. This represents an additional $227 million. We are doubling the very successful COMET program. We are putting in another $100 million for innovation access programs and $151 million for 21,000 equivalent full-time student places with priority in ICT, maths and science. We are also introducing a loans scheme for postgraduate students which, it is calculated, over the years of the program will benefit something like 240,000 postgraduate students within Australia. That initiative in particular has been widely acclaimed, as indeed have all the other measures, by the universities of Australia and by Australia's scientific community. </para><para>I am very pleased to note that, in the lead-up to the making of the statement and in the news reporting that has followed, there has been a very justified and welcome focus on the scientific achievements of Australians. It is worth recording in the wake of this statement that, of the Nobel peace prizes that have been won by Australians, only one—that was the one awarded to Patrick White—was in areas other than research particularly in relation to medical science. This country has a very proud record in generating new ideas. We have always punched above our weight in areas of medical research and medical science. I believe that the Backing Australia's Ability initiative will not only provide more resources—in some areas record levels of resources—but also send a very strong signal to the brightest and best within our community, and also to some formerly within our community now abroad, that this is a country, this is a government and this is a people that very strongly support science and innovation. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Business Activity Statement</title><page.no>23881</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>23881</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Treasurer.

The government has said that it will be considerably simplifying the system once we have got through the transitional period. We have said that. The only way that you can considerably simplify is by keeping the base the same. There is no doubt that the Labor policy of roll-back would be the most exponentially increased complication of the system. Honourable members here will remember that it was 26 June, I think, when we last heard about roll-back.

They are going to roll back the GST and massively complicate the system, and the only thing they cannot do is tell you how. Simplification, as we move through the transitional period, will come from keeping the base the same, knocking out all of the transitional things that were required for the first year and the first year only.

The indexation of excise operates automatically under legislation where excise, which is a flat dollar or cents amount, is indexed to the CPI so that it remains constant in real terms. The last indexation point took place on 1 February under legislation which was introduced in 1983 by the Australian Labor Party and under which the Australian Labor Party automatically moved the excise to the CPI on 23 occasions. The Labor Party passed excise legislation in 1983, and on 23 occasions it moved the excise to the CPI. </para></talk.start><para>I am asked whether I know of any proposed alternatives. The answer is that I do not know of any proposed alternatives, because the Leader of the Opposition, for all of his huffing and bluffing, did a very revealing interview on 3AW yesterday. He was asked this question:</para><quote><para>Mitchell: Is it possible you would look at taking the GST off petrol?</para><para>Beazley: I don't think that we'd give that contemplation.</para><para>Mitchell: But you might look at taking the excise off?</para><para>Beazley: Nor the excise, for that matter.</para><para>Mitchell: Will you consider taking the excise off petrol?</para><para>Beazley: Well, if you took the excise off petrol, what particular schools would you start to shut?</para></quote><para>He has been out there arguing about petrol, and when it actually comes down to it he is in favour of GST and he is in favour of excise. And, what is more, he is in favour of indexation. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is against indexation if it is done now—it actually occurred on 1 February—but if he ever gets into government he will actually be in favour of it then. In other words, his proposition is this: he is against indexation when he does not have any power to do anything about it but when he has power to do something about it he is actually in favour of indexation. He is in favour of indexation if there is a Labor Party government, and he is against indexation if there is a coalition government. This is just another policy-lazy response from an opposition which will not give a straight answer to this question.  </para><para>If you are so against indexation which occurred on 1 February, why won't you reverse it? Why won't you reverse it if you are ever elected? The reason that the Australian Labor Party will not reverse it is that they do not want to stand up and say that $500 million—which we would have to spend in reversing the indexation—as Mr Beazley said, will be saved by closing the following schools. That is what he does not want to do. He wants to go out there and create this idea that he is somehow against indexation, but he will never reverse it. If he is against indexation, let him say that he will reverse it. Let him say which roads will not be built, which schools will be closed. Let him say that he will do something when he absolutely has the capacity or some power. But this idea where he is only in favour of doing something when he has no power to do it is a policy-lazy response. It is just a stunt.

Thirteen separate payment systems have now been reduced onto the one form. So, instead of doing up to 13—some of which were monthly, the wholesale sales tax; some of which were quarterly and some of which were annually—they have now been reduced onto one form. That means that people have to have their quarterly reports in line but they do not have to do 13 payment systems. That has been a great improvement. Other great improvements for small business are: reductions in company tax, the 50 per cent cut in capital gains tax, the opportunity to roll over capital gains tax if you happen to be a retiree and the opportunity to have scrip for scrip capital gains tax free swaps in relation to scrip—all of which took a coalition government to introduce and all of which have been of benefit to small business.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Innovation Statement: Backing Australia's Ability</title><page.no>23883</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23883</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources.

No doubt it will be a disappointment to the shadow minister that 1.1 million businesses have actually lodged their forms. For those that are lodging through tax agents, there is still another two weeks from the weekend to lodge those returns. As I said, 1.1 million with two weeks to run for tax agents—the lodgment rate was better than for the first quarter BAS.</para></talk.start><para>Lodgment information from the Taxation Office shows that 93 per cent of returns were lodged on time, and this represents a better outcome than comparable lodgment rates under the old system, that is, compliance has been better than under the old system. Ninety per cent of businesses indicated that they are confident that their BAS has been completed correctly. Research from the taxpayers themselves shows that, in relation to the first BAS, 63 per cent reported that it took them less than two hours to actually file. Ninety-two per cent of businesses needed to fill out only five boxes in the calculation area. I again recommend to businesses the accounts derived method, which is where you take the actual amount of GST straight from your computer records. There is no requirement to fill in the calculation sheet. I know I have said this in the House before and recommended this method, but I do recommend the method because there are still some businesses that believe you have to do the calculation sheet on the second side, when that is not actually required.</para><para>Notwithstanding that, there are obviously businesses that have found that it has taken more time than the majority have suggested to fill out the BAS. The government believes that it should do everything it can to simplify reporting obligations. Now that we have the experience of the two returns and are halfway through the transitional year, we have the opportunity to very substantially simplify the reporting obligations. I can assure members of the House that it is the government's intention to do that.

Everyone knows that what the Leader of the Opposition is doing is running around the community saying, `Look, they ought to stop the February increase.' But, when somebody says to him, `If you become Prime Minister, will you cancel the February 2001 increase?' he says, `Oh no, you can't ask me to do that—don't ask me to do that.' You know what he wants: he wants to refrain from making the promise so that, if at the time of the next election he does not feel under any pressure to make the promise, he will not make it. That is exactly the thought process of the Leader of the Opposition. All of this posturing does not represent any sincerity on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You can attack our position, but it is a transparent position. We looked at this before Christmas and we had two options: we could have either put $1.6 billion extra into road funding or deferred the February increase. We decided to put it into road funding because we thought that was a better disposition of the money. You cannot do both: you cannot responsibly put $1.6 billion into road funding and defer the increase—at the cost of $500 million annually, which adds up to about $2 billion over a four-year period—and maintain, according to the opposition, an even larger budget surplus than the government are delivering. At the end of the day, when you start running around as a political leader, you have got to produce something that adds up and makes a bit of sense. You can have your pennyworth of fun running around holding up a bit of paper, but in the end you have got to tell the Australian people what you will do if you become Prime Minister. So far you have been given 50 opportunities and you have dingoed it on every occasion.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>23886</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>23886</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, comrades.

The Western Sydney orbital will provide a 39-kilometre route linking the Hume Highway in the south of Sydney to the M4 motorway in the north. It will bypass up to 56 sets of lights, it will save motorists up to an hour each way in travel time and it will, of course, bring very substantial economic development and further jobs to the western areas of Sydney—again, widely welcomed by people on all sides of politics in Western Sydney, despite the noises made in certain quarters in this place. It will, in fact, be the largest single road project under construction in Australia at the time that it is being progressed. At the same time, we announced a detailed study into the northern link to look at how we are going to connect the national highway between the M2 and the F3 in northern Sydney. It will provide a true north-south bypass of Sydney and will bypass the very heavily trafficked Pennant Hills Road. Investigations into options will begin shortly. I should add that they will not reopen the sensitive so-called B2 and B3 corridors.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On January 4, I announced a substantial road package for the Illawarra and South Coast region. It was also very widely welcomed. As part of this package, the New South Wales Labor government have finally recognised Main Road 92 as a road of national importance and they have agreed to match the federal government's commitment to this important link road. At the same time, we announced the $34 million contribution to the North Kiama bypass on the Princes Highway, enabling that project to be fast-tracked.</para><para>In Western Australia we have recognised the importance of the Roe Highway in outer Perth. That, too, will be funded as a road of national importance: we will put $76 million towards it. Higher mass limits are finally under way—an $840 million improvement in GDP annually. Which state held it back the longest? It was New South Wales. But we have had a breakthrough at last. As announced, the federal government will upgrade and strengthen bridges on the Newell Highway as part of $125 million in improvements on that highway.</para><para>Of course, there is then the Roads to Recovery Program, which was widely welcomed by local governments across Australia. We are on track to start paying cheques under the Roads to Recovery Program by the end of this month. The Prime Minister referred a moment ago to the commonsense approach of looking to the future and building this national infrastructure. The fact is that it is a responsible government that builds for tomorrow and does not tamper with the excise system. That is what we are doing.</para><para>The final part of the question went to alternative policies. The only alternative we have in this area is a policy bypass—not even laziness; just a policy bypass. The only announcement we have heard is the recognition that it was good to go ahead with the WSO. Labor never had a RONI program, so there was no Main Road 92, North Kiama bypass or Roe Highway. If they had had their way, there would not be higher mass limits. The New South Wales Labor government has held out for a long time on that vital reform. That is not just policy laziness in this area but a policy bypass.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Petrol Prices</title><page.no>23887</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>23887</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister.

That is all that needs to be said. The second point that must be made is that we are spending a great deal of extra money—as I have just outlined—on a series of very valuable road infrastructure projects across Australia. The reality is quite simple: better roads deliver all sorts of economic benefits, such as lower fuel usage and safety—which is very important in Australia today. They reduce transport costs and make it possible for people to do simple things, such as take their children to school in many remote areas. That cannot be done in many parts of this country when there is wet weather or whatever.</para></talk.start><para>The other point that must be made is that, when it comes to fuel excise, Labor's hypocrisy knows no bounds.

I can inform her that unemployment in Western Australia peaked at 11.4 per cent in 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the member for Fremantle was the state Premier. The good news is that, since February 1993—particularly since March 1996—Western Australia has been the gold medal economic performer amongst the Australian states. Since then, there have been 200,000 new jobs, unemployment has come down from 10 per cent to under six per cent and average weekly earnings have grown from under $600 to over $800—which is significantly above the national average. </para></talk.start><para>This increase is thanks, in part, to the spread of workplace agreements under federal and state legislation. Some 300,000 Western Australian workers—or nearly one-third of the work force—are on workplace agreements. I have been asked about threats to progress in employment. The Western Australian opposition has done a secret deal with the trade union movement to abolish workplace agreements. That secret deal, done by the policy-lazy Western Australian Labor Party, stipulates `the total abolition of individual agreements'. Forcing Western Australian workers back into the award system could mean a pay cut of up to 30 per cent. That means that Western Australian workers could be up to 30 per cent worse off if the Labor Party wins the coming election. The Court government has been a very good friend to the workers of Western Australia and it deserves to be re-elected on Saturday.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee</title><page.no>23888</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>23888</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

I am pleased to be able to inform honourable members that this morning I went with the member for Gippsland down to Bairnsdale in the eastern part of Gippsland to announce the rural clinical schools and university departments of rural health. This is a $117 million commitment by this government to dramatically change the way medical education is delivered in Australia and which will affect it for generations to come. We have had some idea of how this is going to work through what we have already done with the university departments at Geraldton, Whyalla, Shepparton, Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Launceston, and the new clinical school at Wagga Wagga. These have been a staggering success. In Wagga Wagga alone the clinical school has attracted 12 doctors through GPs—specialists who would not be there otherwise. I visited Shepparton with the member for Murray late last year. In Broken Hill there are over 60 people employed at the university department in rural health who would not be there had we not put the initiative in place. I was able to announce today new clinical schools at Coffs Harbour, Dubbo, Rockhampton, Toowoomba, Kalgoorlie, the Riverland—in your own electorate, Mr Speaker—Bairnsdale, Shepparton, Whyalla and Burnie. In addition, we have new university departments at Tamworth and Lismore.  </para></talk.start><para>This will mean that, when these are operating in 12 months time, 25 per cent of all medical students will spend half of their clinical training in rural Australia. A kid who comes from eastern Gippsland will not have to go to the city for six or seven years to study medicine. They will be able to go to the city for three years to do their basic science training and then go back into the country. We will be putting in a substantial medical and health infrastructure. In the cities in which it is already operating, we have shown what a difference this can make. </para><para>In contrast, I was asked about other policies. We have a benchmark for the Labor Party.

Prime Minister, will you confirm that in the government's recent innovation statement the five-year cost of the 175 per cent tax concession was estimated at $460 million and savings from changes to the treatment of plant items used for R&amp;D were estimated at $345 million? Is it the case that, in addition, the government changed the definition of R&amp;D to require companies to meet both innovation and high technical risk rests to qualify for R&amp;D tax concessions, extended the application of the exclusion list to cover supporting activities and introduced a new requirement that R&amp;D activities which receive the tax concession are to be the subject of a plan approved by a controlling entity? Prime Minister, what are the estimated savings to revenue of these changes?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23892</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can confirm that the early part of the question put to me is substantially in accord with my recollection, without having the document in front of me. It is true—and the government made no attempt at all to hide this fact—that we have made changes that introduce a premium rate but at the same time result in some revenue savings, and that was made perfectly clear. As to the cost of those last items you have mentioned, I frankly do not have that with me. I will be very happy to find that out and let the honourable member know. But can I say, in relation to the R&amp;D component of the plan, that it has been very well received by industry. It is not everything that industry wanted. Industry wanted us to go back to 150 per cent and some of them wanted a 200 per cent premium rate and of course they wanted the widest possible eligibility criteria. We all want everything in an ideal world, and we decided that a greater premium ought to be placed on putting resources into things like the CRCs. The CRCs have been successful. One of the pieces of evidence of the success of the CRCs is that they were originally leveraging about $2 for every one government dollar; it is now closer to $3 or $4. That does represent very good value for money. </para></talk.start><para>Overwhelmingly, the advice that we got when we were putting the group of measures together was that we should have a greater emphasis on the research side of the equation. To those ministers who accompanied me to meetings of the Prime Minister's Science Council, particularly the last meeting, when we went through very carefully the options that were open to us, it was very clear that there was unanimous support for a doubling of the Australian Research Council grants, and obviously you had to put in extra university infrastructure to make them viable. There was very strong support for putting extra resources into biotechnology and into information and communications technology—very strong support indeed. </para><para>There was quite a bit of debate about the relative value of the R&amp;D part of it. It is instructive that the tax concessions in the United States, according to my understanding, are less generous in relation to research and development than they are in Australia. Therefore I say to people who simply recite the industry mantra that all you have to do is ramp up the taxation concession to ever higher levels, that that is not necessarily the universal experience of those around the world. But I would be very happy to see if I can get the information for the honourable member, and when it is available I will give it to her.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Banking: Services</title><page.no>23892</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>23892</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</name><name.id>FB6</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation.

There is a very specific reason why this fuel excise increase, above all others, ought to be frozen right now and that is that most of this fuel excise increase comes from the inflationary impact of the goods and services tax. Among his solemn undertakings to the Australian electorate, the Prime Minister undertook that the GST would have no effect upon the price of petrol. If the Prime Minister has any integrity at all, he will accept that this legislation needs to be passed now by this parliament, to offer relief to Australian taxpayers. A week or two ago, the Prime Minister took pleasure in a small reduction in the price of milk, but when it comes to a greater reduction in costs to households through this change to the price of petrol, he turns away from it. In so doing, he compounds the deception of the Australian people which he engaged in when he made the undertaking on the impact of the GST on the price of petrol.</para></talk.start><para>Fuel prices have risen and taxation measures associated with them have been indexed over the years.

Then we have Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen, who has not only vowed to see that the Prime Minister's petrol promise is kept—I cite the <inline font-style="italic">Diamond Valley News</inline>, 1 March 2000—but also told ABC radio last October that she expected her call for a freeze on excise to gain increasing backbench support. So Fran Bailey, come on down! And all those mythical backbenchers who are with you, come on down as well!</para><para>Then we have Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert in Queensland. He has called on the government to freeze the February excise. Well, Peter Lindsay, come on down! You will have your opportunity to freeze the February excise. We could go on through the list: Bob Charles, Kay Hull, Bruce Billson, Dr Sharman Stone. One after another they have indicated to their constituents that they would be very pleased to have the opportunity to support the idea of a petrol freeze. </para><para>The point of this exercise, the reason we are arguing this, beyond simply the fact that there was a Howard government promise, is because we know right now that this is affordable. The government, who argue that they have introduced a charter of budget honesty, are notably dishonest and reluctant about revealing the size of the windfall that they have obtained from the impact of petrol price rises on their tax collections. But they know and we know that the windfall is substantial—and, more to the point, organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and AAA know that the windfall has been substantial. And we were able, in a committee that we had operating on this, to demonstrate that that was so. </para><para>Mr Howard's defence in this place is that he will spend the entirety of that windfall on $1.6 billion worth of road funds over the next four years. That is $400 million a year for the next four years. This windfall started to be reaped months ago. The first spending from it starts in July—that is, there will be 10 months free of any offsets. But we also know from what we have been able to discern that that $400 million a year is a great deal less than what the government reaped from changes in the resource rental tax that they did not anticipate in the last budget; it is less than what they are reaping on this strike price that they originally contemplated for the GST, and less than what they are now reaping from a massively increased price of fuel, particularly in rural and regional Australia. The government have talked about the strike price being 90c. In fact, for every cent a litre over 74c that the price of fuel rises, the government increase their take over that which they compensated for in reductions in fuel excise, and for every cent over, probably, the mid-eighties, but certainly 90c, they reap a greater return than they anticipated in their budget. The budget contained that deception, or the consolidation of that deception, but they are doing even better than their budget allowed for.</para><para>I might say that the calculation by Lauchlan McIntosh of the Australian Automobile Association is that it is $1.34 billion per annum that they are reaping in windfall—that is, $1.34 billion per annum more than they anticipated in the last budget. The Prime Minister asked me today, `What do you mean by the term “windfall”?' I presume he knew there must have been some form of windfall there, otherwise you would have had a different explanation for his $400 million. But what he has not done is challenge these figures that have been forthcoming with anything like a detailed alternative. So if you add together his $400 million and the effect of this freeze, you will see that it in fact comes to something like $900 million out of that $1.34 billion. So let it not be said that this Prime Minister could not afford it from the windfall and still do it within the constraints of fiscal responsibility.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party is saying that we will move this legislation and we will put pressure, from now until the conclusion of this parliament, on those backbenchers who said that they would implement the Prime Minister's electoral promise. We will be doing that. And we will of course be taking a look at the next set of budget papers and at what the government does in fact do with this windfall before we finally make up our minds on what we intend to do about incorporating this within our roll-back of the goods and services tax. We will be doing that. But right now what we will be doing in this parliament is ensuring that this parliament has a regular opportunity to vote in favour of the Prime Minister's taxation promise at the last election. We will ensure that this parliament has a regular opportunity to uphold the Prime Minister's personal integrity as far as this matter is concerned.</para><para>This government has not been shy about increases in fuel taxes. It has now presided over four increases in fuel taxation in just seven months. The first occurred on 1 July with the government's refusal to drop the fuel excise by the full extent of the GST to which I have already referred. The second increase in fuel taxation occurred on 1 August when the fuel excise was automatically adjusted for inflation during the first six months of 2000. The fuel excise adjustment at that time was 0.675c per litre, and the GST added a further 10 per cent to this increase, making it a total of 0.74c. The third increase in fuel taxation occurred as a result of the GST adding 10 per cent to increases in fuel prices caused by other factors such as the rise in world oil prices and a depreciating Australian dollar. And the fourth increase in fuel taxation occurred on 1 February 2001 as a fuel excise indexation adjustment flowed from the inflation outcome for the second six months of 2000. So we have had four increases in seven months in the price of fuel as a result of decisions taken by this government. Those four increases have assisted in producing that result of a substantial windfall to the budget. </para><para>As our petrol price committee went round the country we found, from one witness after another—from owner drivers, from the taxi industry, from farmers, from the fishing industry and from the tourism industry—indications of a slowdown in their business activities which were directly related to the price of fuel. It should be noted, in the public generally and in this parliament, that, despite the optimism that has been around the Australian economy now for eight years, there is now pessimism amongst consumers and amongst businesses. That pessimism is reflected in intentions about business investment, which are lower than just about at any time in living memory. It has nothing to do with the impact of changes in the United States economy, on the Australian economy or on those of our trading partners. If the United States is experiencing a slowdown, there will be some impact of that on us later in this year or early next year. The slowdown which is occurring in this country now comes from economic management incompetence reflected in the way in which the GST has impacted on business activity—a totally home-grown proposition—which has enmeshed business people in paperwork, which has taken their attention off the main game and which is spoiling their efforts to employ Australians. It has come from the considerable impact of the increase in price of petrol on activity in a whole range of businesses where travel is involved, particularly for those who are the consumers.</para><para>There was a plea from the heart of those people, who are no friends of Labor in normal circumstances, that we do something about it. There has been an even bigger plea from country Australia. Last week, I was in the Kimberleys and had an opportunity to look at some of the prices being paid by folk in the Kimberleys in the last week. The monthly high in Broome was 112c a litre. Understand this: the impact of the GST on all goods and the impact of the GST on fuel in particular is a massive additional impost on rural and regional Australia. For the first time, governments have found a way to slug the rural areas with higher levels of tax than they slug folk in the city.</para><para>The consequences have been that in places like Broome it is 112c for a litre of petrol; in Bunbury, 106c; and in Carnarvon, 108c. When I was up there and suggested that the effect of this Labor Party bill would be to lower it by 1½c, I have to tell you that they did not sneer at me. They thought it was a pretty darned good idea and a pretty good start. We are going to keep faith with them, because we are going to move this bill all year. We will be able to demonstrate who are the friends and who are the enemies of ordinary Australian consumers; who keep promises and who do not. We will be demonstrating that clearly throughout the course of this year, and this is the start of the process. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>23897</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Financial Services and Regulation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I noted that the Leader of the Opposition just said—and he repeated it on a number of occasions—that they are going to move this bill all year.

The Labor Party has a good history on excise because the excise increase, even in allowing for the impact of the GST, was less than 2c in February this year. In 1986 the Labor Party increased excise by 5.3c a litre, nearly three times the increase of February this year, and only a few months later the Labor Party increased it again by 2.622c a litre. That was in 1986—it was Labor Party policy—and they did it again as a special budget initiative in 1994. They increased it by 3c a litre. But we have crocodile tears from the Labor Party now. Then only a few months later it went up 1.1c a litre and then again by 1.3c a litre. It is one thing in opposition; another thing in government! The best way to explain it comes from the shadow finance minister. I could not have said it better than the shadow finance minister. In this place, in 1994, the shadow finance minister, the member for Melbourne, said:</para><quote><para>Where do honourable members opposite think the money for the public health system comes from?</para><para>...			...			...</para><para>Stop all this nonsense and bleeding heart rhetoric that it is terrible for some people to pay a few dollars more per week in petrol.</para></quote><para>That was the Labor Party in government.

We had the Leader of the Opposition thumping the table about the people in Broome, protesting how the people in Broome were ropeable about petrol prices. Under the new tax system, people in Broome get a 1c and 2c subsidy per litre from this government. In fact, people right around Australia, in rural and regional Australia, are getting a 1c and 2c subsidy from the government, which was never provided by the Labor Party. In fact, we found last year the member for Hunter expressly saying that the Labor Party were going to remove it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Billson</name></talker><para>—That is quite right: they never liked it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>—He said it in this place during an MPI.

It is just that one and one is not equalling two here. The Leader of the Opposition came in here and said, `Mr Speaker, we are going to fight for the people in Broome. They are worried about every cent of petrol. They are worried about every cent and the impact of this.' Damn right they are worried about every cent! We know that. That is why we gave them a 1c and 2c subsidy on their petrol. That is why we did it—nearly $400 million a year, a subsidy to people in rural and regional Australia as part of the introduction of A New Tax System. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not going to let the Deputy Leader of the Opposition off the hook here. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is a feisty character when it comes to these issues, has so far been mute during this debate, but I am sure he has something to say. One of my colleagues drew my attention to some words from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last year in an ABC radio interview in Queensland. I quote:</para><quote><para>We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ronaldson</name></talker><para>—Would you say that again?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>—These are the words from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime.</para></quote><para>I will go back to the beginning of the quote.

What—what sort of commitment can Labor make regarding fuel excise?</para><para>SIMON CREAN: Well, what we've—basically our position has been that there needs to be this mix between indirect taxes and direct taxes. We always had fuel excise in that mix. We were not proposing to make any changes to the fuel excise regime.</para></quote><para>I commend the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because he is consistent. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said last year is absolutely right. The Labor Party, if they are elected, will do absolutely nothing to change excise on fuel. So how can they come into this place, pretend to move a bill to repeal the introduction of the excise— nearly 2c a litre in the beginning of February—and say in this place that they are going to push in opposition all year to repeal that excise increase when, if they get into government, it will be: `Oh, no, we're not going to do it'? It is a policy vacuum. The only words that can express it appropriately are `policy lazy'. The Labor Party have not done their homework. Even in this place today during question time with the little stunt on the annual returns for BAS, they were caught out. Why were they caught out? Because they cannot deliver on their stunt on annual returns for BAS. Why can't they deliver? Because they have not done the policy hard work that would explain to the small businesses of Australia that you cannot change the tax base and expect to have comparable quarterly figures. You cannot have roll-back and deliver an annual return. You cannot do it, and they have been caught out. They have not been out to lunch; they have just been out over the last five years. The Labor Party have not done their homework.</para><para>If this is just a small taste of the Labor Party's attitude towards policy development, we are going to get a fantastic opportunity over the next few months to point out the stark differences between a policy-lazy opposition and a government, a coalition, that is doing the hard yards. When it comes to petrol prices, we know that people have been hurting. We know that there is great volatility in petrol prices around Australia. Volatility comes about for a number of reasons. No. 1 is competition in the delivery of petrol to consumers; and No. 2, and the most significant reason for that price volatility, is the volatility in the price of oil. Australia imports around 65 per cent of its petrol. The price differential between the Singapore mogas level one day and the Singapore mogas level the next day is reflected at the pump, and every government in the world is facing the same problem. There is consumer concern. We understand that, but we are fair dinkum with the Australian electorate. We say we are not going to pull on a stunt that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars each year. We are not going to do it because we want to be fair dinkum with the Australian electorate about the fact that we want to spend some money on roads.</para><para>A one-off stunt such as dropping the excise on fuel in February has a cost, and it will cost roads. It will cost roads on the Mornington Peninsula. It will cost roads in Geelong. It will cost roads in the electorate of Indi. It will cost roads in Ipswich. It will cost roads in Ballarat. It will cost roads in various electorates right around the country, including the Labor electorates. That is what it will cost. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it is going to make a huge difference to the price of petrol over a year to have a single change such as the excise change that he is proposing, he is sadly wrong, because that volatility will remain whilst the world oil price is the single most significant factor in considering the price of petrol at the pump. </para><para>We are coming into a very challenging year, an interesting political year. In an interesting political year, certain events are obviously going to unfold which start to reveal the true character of the key players. This is the first event. The first event occurred today, when the Leader of the Opposition put forward two proposals which are not credible. Proposal 1, which we talked about, involves the annual BAS statement, which he cannot deliver straightaway if he is going to have roll-back at the same time. The second proposal is that they are going to stop the excise increase on petrol. You have to have integrity to be believed by the electorate. They have to be able to say, `Yes, I believe what that person is saying and I'm going to support them.' The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is this: when it comes to policy there is no integrity because there is no consistency, and Australians can see right through that. They can see that the Leader of the Opposition is talking the talk in opposition but that he will not walk the walk in government.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition is facing a more significant problem when it comes to policy. The Leader of the Opposition has to think about what the real impacts are of these fly-by-night initiatives that are being thought up the morning before in his office. He has to think about what the cost is of his promises at election time. He has to think about how he is going to deliver the larger surpluses of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition while, at the same time, spending more money on health and education. He has to think about how he is going to be able to spend more money on innovation and how he is going to spend more money on roll-back and, at the same time, to deliver for the Australian people. This is the first MPI debate of what is going to be a long year of policy debate. The fundamental problem the Labor Party has is that it lacks policy integrity, and that has come about because the Labor Party is policy lazy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>23900</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who has just spoken, talked about being fair dinkum, he talked about integrity and he talked about the money they have spent on roads. Let me say this about integrity: what more does it take than for a Prime Minister during the election campaign to promise the world that the price of petrol would not go up as a result of the GST but, when he introduced the GST, the price of petrol did go up as a result? Talk about being fair dinkum! Talk about honouring your promise! That is what this debate is about. This was a promise of the Prime Minister's—no ifs, no buts. It was an absolute, ironclad guarantee that the price of petrol would not go up as a result of the GST, but it has.</para></talk.start><para>Today we announced a private member's bill, the petrol tax cut bill, which seeks to get this government to honour that promise. We know it will not honour it because we have been calling for it to do so for some months now, ever since it announced the cut in the excise, so what we are proposing is a bill that does no more and no less than deliver its integrity and deliver on its promise to the Australian electorate. The Australian punters will not forgive a government that says one thing during the election campaign and then ditches it as soon as it gets into office, and that is what you have done in relation to the GST and petrol. </para><para>But this is also a bill that tests the mettle of local coalition MPs who say one thing at home and another in Canberra—the `heroes at home but cowards in Canberra' brigade. There is a nice little list of them: the member for Makin, the member for Kennedy, the member for Hume, the member for Murray and the member for McEwen, who is not here today although I noticed that she was up in the plane with us on Sunday night. Conveniently, she is not here today for this debate. She has been one of the most vocal in calling for the petrol tax excise to be frozen for the February adjustment. There is also the member for Herbert, the member for Dunkley and the member for Riverina. All of those coalition members of parliament have, at one stage or another, called for cuts to petrol prices or for a freeze in the indexation of petrol. They have called for it in their electorates. They have gone out and got the local newspapers and the local radio stations together and said, `I'm representing my constituents. I'm going to go down to Canberra, and I'm going to make merry hell with John Howard and Peter Costello. I'm going to tell them to deliver the promise that we campaigned on.' But get them back into this parliament and they cringe like cowards. These people do not deserve respect. They cannot have it both ways: they cannot promise to do something in their electorate and then rat on it when they get up here in the parliament. The purpose of this bill is to test their mettle, to give them an opportunity to speak here, to act here and to vote here in a way which reflects what they have been telling their constituents back home. </para><para>Let us just go to what caused this problem in the price of petrol. John Howard promised during the election campaign:</para><quote><para>... the price of petrol will not rise as a result of the GST.</para></quote><para>That was his commitment to the Australian public. But it was made by not only John Howard but also Peter Costello, who said in the parliament on 25 November:</para><quote><para>In fact, when you equalise out the tax arrangements, you get the same amount of revenue anyway. The excise comes down and the 10 per cent—</para></quote><para>that is, the GST—</para><quote><para>goes back up. It is the same amount of tax.</para></quote><para>This is the Treasurer of the nation telling this parliament that the government was going to reduce the excise by the amount the GST went up. The trouble is that it reduced the excise by 6.7c a litre and the GST put it up 8.2c a litre—a 1½c a litre difference. That is the first windfall to this government, because that could not have been factored into the budget. Why couldn't it have been factored in? Because this government was going around the country promising it would drop the excise by the same amount the GST went up. That is the first windfall. But it is a problem that is compounded by the GST and indexation, because it is a tax on a tax. Every time the GST goes up the indexation applies to that increased amount. That is the second windfall which we are trying to get the detail of and which the government is not forthcoming on.</para><para>There is another windfall, and that is the widening gap between the tax paid by the city and country, because for the first time in this country regional motorists, rural motorists, outback motorists are paying more tax on their petrol than those in the city. Under Labor's proposal we had a flat excise. It applied the same wherever you lived. But now, because the GST applies to the retail price, it widens when the gap widens. That is another windfall, at the cost of regional Australia. What of the Prime Minister's commitment in terms of the Nyngan declaration that we are not going to widen the city-country divide? There is also the OPEC windfall, whereby every time the petrol rises a cent the government gets another one-eleventh of it. That is not to mention the further windfall, which is the petroleum resource rent tax windfall.</para><para>Labor have put 36 questions on notice to this government trying to identify the extent of the windfall from all of those different interacting parts. No answer yet from the government. That is why we are keeping going the petrol inquiry that the Leader of the Opposition referred to. But the most disgraceful performance today was from the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that those figures on windfall do not stack up; that is all you need to know. What contempt is this—for the government to not only break a promise but then withhold the information by which we can ascertain the extent of windfall and actually pin down the detail of what we could do by way of returning that windfall to Australian motorists? </para><para>I will give this government a challenge: tell us the extent of the windfall, and we will start identifying what we do with it. But until such time as you tell us that information you are contemptible in suggesting that we have got to nominate what we do. Forget about what happens when we become a government 10 months down the track; what people want to know is what is going to happen now. They want petrol tax relief immediately, and that is what this bill that we are proposing does. It argues that we should reverse the decision already taken which imposes the 1 February indexation adjustment. We should reverse that decision because that is the same as washing the GST impact out of the petrol price adjustments. What would be the end impact of that? It would result in motorists getting around 2c a litre off their petrol. That is us delivering the government's hand on heart pledge, the pledge that said the price of petrol would not go up as a result of the GST and the promise that they would reduce the excise by the amount that the GST took it up.</para><para>When it suits him the Prime Minister talks about the Australian motorists not really caring about 2c a litre. Go and tell that to the Australian motorists. It may not matter to you, Prime Minister, who would not have had to have paid for a litre of petrol in decades, but the Australian motorist, who has to pay this day in and day out to get to work, to take the kids to sporting events, et cetera, is the one that needs it. Labor want to test this bill in this House, and for that reason I move:</para><motion><para>That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from introducing forthwith a bill to reverse the 1 February excise rate increase for petroleum and a bill to reverse the related customs rate increase and the bills being passed through all stages without delay.</para></motion><para>I move that and say that the House should debate this immediately and get those cowards to come down here and be counted. We are saying that this is a mob out of control. This is a mob that has not got a policy, and they want to criticise us. This is a government that made a promise and has broken it. We want the suspension of standing and sessional orders. The government do not know what they are doing. Where is Peter Reith? Bring them in.

It is quite interesting to see that the opposition wanted to interrupt its own case in the MPI by pulling two further stunts—that is, moving a motion for the suspension of standing orders and then the consequential division. There was not much logic in trying to galvanise the Australian community to support the Labor Party's policy. The most important thing that has come out of today is the confirmation that the Labor Party does not actually have a policy on this. It has a policy to have many stunts to try to create fear and uncertainty, and also to attract attention, but in doing so it highlights the fact that its strategy in this regard is causing confusion. It is not really getting brownie points as it thinks it is. People should look at today's Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>, under the heading `ALP's mixed message on fuel pricing'. The article said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>A Labor government would not remove the GST from petrol, nor would it cut fuel excise, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said yesterday. </para></quote><para>During the MPI today, the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the legislation that we have just had the stunt on, about the fuel excise. He said, `We will look at the budget papers before we finally make up our mind,' referring to the policy regarding excise and indexation. Then we heard the shadow Treasurer as the second speaker in the MPI, before those opposite pulled a stunt and arranged that his speech did not go on. You can understand a shadow Treasurer not wanting to get too far into the question of whether a Labor government with him as Treasurer would in fact want to vary the excise revenue stream that they so rely on, and I will talk about that in a minute. We heard the shadow Treasurer say, `Forget what's going to happen if Labor gets into government in 10 months time,' or words to that effect. I took notes as the shadow Treasurer spoke, and they may not be the exact words but that is the meaning of what he said. Again, that was confirming that today's MPI is a stunt. ALP shadow ministers and backbenchers have been parading around over the question of the fuel excise and indexation, trying to convince the Australian community that they are going to do something substantial and effective about the excise and indexation. In fact, today we have had confirmation on the record in the MPI that all they can do is pull a stunt, that they have not finally made up their mind, as the Leader of the Opposition said today. The shadow Treasurer says, `Forget about what is going to happen in government.' In other words, he says, `Don't ask us about that; it doesn't matter what we are going to do in government.' We know, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition has said, `We haven't made up our mind anyway.'</para><para>That is quite an interesting situation for Labor to have put itself in. If it wants to win the hearts and minds of Australians, it surely cannot do that. If it does do that, it does not deserve to win. That is particularly so because Labor's record on fuel and excise for 13 years in government is very well recorded and very well understood by the Australian community. I have been pleasantly surprised in talking with ordinary people about their understanding of Labor's dismal performance in relation to fuel excise and indexation. It is now very well known and understood by Australians that Labor governments started off their term of office in 1983, with Mr Hawke as Prime Minister, when excise was 6.1c per litre. By the time they left office 13 years later—sadly, because Australia still bears some of the scars of their 13 years of incompetence—they had increased the petrol excise deliberately as a budget exercise and taken it to 34.2c a litre. </para><para>I have laid out the summary of the historical context of Labor governments for 13 years to try and show that what we have seen today in the MPI and what we see unfolding in Labor's campaign around Australia on fuel excise and indexation is inconsistent with their own performance in government. Today we have had Mr Beazley and Mr Crean actually confirm that in government they will do quite different things from what they are now trying to con the Australian community into thinking they want to achieve. We have corroboration that they will in fact do what? Let me say what they will do. They will go back to the days when they were in government, when they took petrol excise from 6.1c to 34.1c over their 13 years in government, increased taxes in other areas quite substantially and overspent and charged the government's current expenditure to the credit cards and put us into a $10-billion-plus deficit. That is what will unfold. It is quite clear. The reason they cannot come clean on this is that they already have a stack of promises and pledges and pay-offs and debts that they have to pay, as we see unfolding with the Victorian Bracks government, a similar example. </para><para>In my electorate, at Wangaratta today the price of unleaded fuel is, as far as I have been able to ascertain from inquiries I have made, actually less than the price of fuel on 31 January this year prior to the indexation coming in. At 12.30 today the Apco service station, the independent service station in Wangaratta, was charging 88.5c per litre for fuel. My experience is that, if they are doing that, all the other service stations in Wangaratta are doing the same. Can I just mention that the Apco service system is a refreshing new system of retailing fuel in regional Australia, and I commend them for their efforts. Since they opened in Wangaratta, they have consistently brought the gap between city and country prices down, by about eight or nine cents on average. That is my observation. They are consistently marketing fuel in the Wangaratta region, for the first time for decades, at a price which is approximately the highest price you would find in a Melbourne metropolitan situation. So we now have real competition.</para><para>The reason for that, apart from Apco's initiatives and investments and their courage to get into innovative marketing in fuel and to provide an efficient system of fuel distribution—and by the way they are apparently very profitable, too, so they are doing it very well—is that the Howard government when it was elected in 1996 said, `We are going to increase competition in fuel in regional Australia in order that country people can see the gap between city and country prices narrow.' It is very frustrating. It takes a long time to get this competition in; we all know that, but Wangaratta is an example of the Howard government's success in that regard. How can it come about? Apco have their own B-double tanker and driver, and they go and collect the fuel from Shell and Mobil refineries. And that is because the Howard government on election set to to reform industrial relations and to get rid of the sweetheart lock-out deal of the Laidley agreement which prevented people having access. We fought, and we had to fight the Labor opposition then. We had to get through the Senate. It took a long time. We fought to get industrial laws changed so that no longer could people lock out people who were there with their money, with a driver who was trained and a proper fuel tanker that was safe, to embark on commerce in Australia in the way it ought to be—a fair go for everybody. Now we see emerging incidences like Apco, due to the Howard government's reform policies. Might I add that every one of those reforms was opposed by the Labor opposition—every one of them. If we had not been able to get our legislation through, after a lot of delays, today the people in Wangaratta, a city I represent, would not be enjoying 88.5c a litre for unleaded, despite the indexation that occurred on 1 February. That is a significant development. In other cities and towns that I represent we are working hard to try to get new competition in. I know my colleagues in the government are also working in regional Australia to do the same. We call on local governments to help us and some of them are. Some of them are slow. Pull your socks up, local government! Let us get these independents in. Let us get real competition in and we will narrow the gap. The Howard government's policy is that that is what should happen. Let me also mention that the Bracks Labor government used to be— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

shown a great deal of bipartisanship in the management of immigration issues. In particular, the opposition has assisted the government's attempts to stem the rise of people smuggling as a global enterprise and to reduce Australia's attractiveness as a destination for illegal immigrants, especially those without valid claims to refugee status. However, there remain some areas in which the government and Labor cannot agree, where the fundamental differences between our two parties remain. Labor believes that compassion, fairness, flexibility and principles of natural justice should override administrative efficiencies. One such area is the restriction of legal avenues for migration appeals. There are two bills currently in the pipeline that seek to deny the right of review to visa applicants: the judicial review bill, which the minister for immigration has delayed in introducing into the House, and the bill being debated here today, the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>. </para></talk.start><para>This so-called class action bill is, the opposition believes, based on a flawed rationale and is intended to restrict judicial review by preventing class actions in migration matters before the Federal Court and the High Court. If passed by parliament, this bill would introduce absolute time limits for applications to the High Court in migration matters—an action which in itself may be construed as an attempt to impede the High Court's constitutional rights. In the opposition's opinion, the minister is either misinformed or misguided in his belief that the introduction of legislation such as this bill will lower the costs of litigation in migration matters or shorten delays in appeals of decisions. On the contrary, the minister's crusade to eventually completely restrict the right to seek judicial review in all migration matters with bills such as this one and the judicial review bill, which is on even more tenuous constitutional ground, is likely to result in infinitely higher legal costs, both for the immigration department and their clients, and infinitely longer delays, which in some cases I understand may run into years. </para><para>Class actions are an important instrument by which migration decisions can be challenged, as they offer equity and efficiency. Class actions provide a streamlined process for what could otherwise become a quagmire of individual decisions based on test cases, individual actions by a myriad of appellants or huge numbers of appeals lodged directly in Australia's highest court, the High Court. I am not for one moment, and neither is the opposition, condoning the practices of some migration lawyers who seek to recruit class action applicants by means that are less than ethical or are even misleading. However, we must not fall into the trap where we use the parliament and legislation to micromanage issues such as advertising by migration lawyers in local newspapers. Our goal should be the provision of a low-cost, efficient and equitable avenue for people to exercise their rights to a court hearing. In this respect class actions offer equity and efficiency. Equity comes from low cost to individuals, enabling them access to the courts—access that would otherwise be prohibitive. The courts can operate efficiently when considering class actions and they are able to resolve multiple identical claims in one hearing rather than being required to rule on often thousands of individual judgments.</para><para>If the government's concerns are costs and delays, then retaining rather than removing class actions remains a compelling argument. The removal of class actions as a means of stemming rising legal costs and the incidence of litigation does not stand up under any measure of argument. The minister attempts to justify his decision to restrict class actions, group actions and representative proceedings by stating that, of the 14 actions commenced since 1997, none succeeded. In fact, I am sure that by now the minister is aware that in at least one instance a class action has been upheld in the Federal Court. I am referring to the 1998 decision of the Federal Court in Fazal Din versus the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. </para><para>A number of other serious concerns were raised by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and supported by numerous reports submitted by community and welfare organisations. I will refer later to the dissenting report. I thank the members of that committee who dissented for the excellent job they did. One of the most controversial parts of this bill and one which arguably challenges the very nature of the role of the High Court is the imposition of an absolute time limit for lodgment of applications to the High Court. While the minister has tabled amendments extending the time limit from 28 to 35 days—if he has not yet tabled them, I understand he intends to—the principle remains and, being an absolute time limit, the High Court would be unable to amend it. Because the right to apply for review of administrative decisions is conferred on the High Court by the Constitution, it cannot be removed by legislation. Accordingly the government's move to impose a time limit goes beyond being merely a procedural limitation to achieve a policy outcome. Indeed, the imposition of this provision may be considered interference to the judicial process. Section 75 (v) of the Constitution states:</para><quote><para>In all matters—</para><para>...</para><para>(v.) In which a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth:</para><para>the High Court shall have original jurisdiction.</para></quote><para>Categorically then, migration decisions come within the original jurisdiction of the High Court. While the government may not think that the imposition of time limits interferes with the judicial power of the Commonwealth, I can assure you that many constitutional lawyers would have a field day at the first opportunity of challenging this in court. Based on longstanding legal precedents, such as Lyinage versus R (1967), there is a view indicating that this bill's failure to provide the High Court with a discretion to extend the time limits in appropriate circumstances may constitute an attempt to control the High Court, thus interfering with the judicial process itself. The Howard government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs are entering very dangerous, uncharted waters with such provisions. In a way, the minister should be thanking the Labor Party and the Democrats—who I understand will oppose this bill—for opposing this bill, thus saving him the embarrassment of successful constitutional challenges. Of course, I do not expect any thanks to be forthcoming.</para><para>On the basis of policy rather than legal arguments, the introduction of a time limit will almost certainly impose unfair disadvantages on many legitimate applicants for judicial review of migration decisions in a bid to capture those who are said to be intent on abusing the review system. A limit of 28 days or even 35 days is hardly sufficient to allow an individual to learn of an adverse decision, realise their options, find and consult a lawyer and then file in the High Court. In their submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the National Council of Churches stated:</para><quote><para>Asylum seekers should be reasonably expected to have more problems than other administrative law claimants do in meeting strict deadlines. They may need to have the written notification of the decision in their case and their right to review translated and explained. They are often in detention where their freedom of movement, access to communication and legal advice is severely curtailed. If they are in detention—and different issues face people in detention—they have to first realise that they do not have to go to the Federal Court or wait for the minister to turn them down before they can go to the High Court.</para><para>Basically if they are in detention they have to try to access a lawyer and there are a lot of problems with external access for people in detention—phones etc. They have to find a migration agent or a lawyer. It cannot be any lawyer, it has to be a lawyer who is registered as a migration agent ... that again cuts down on the amount of pro bono access you can get. Understanding what the court will be able to do for them once they get there is a big problem.</para><para>They have to have translators, they have to make sure they have understood the actual reason they were turned down in the first place and they have to explain that to their lawyers. They have to be able to get the notice of the decision or they might have to lodge FOI claims if they need to get specific security information that is related to their case— </para></quote><para>and on and on. They have to do all of this and more in 28 or perhaps 35 days. That is hardly possible and certainly, by no stretch of the imagination, fair. The High Court's proper role is as Australia's final appellate court and arbiter of the Constitution. Yet due to changes such as those contained in this bill, increasingly it is being asked to perform the role of lower courts. Justices of the High Court have expressed their objections on many occasions to performing trial work that should be confined to the lower courts. The changes proposed in this are likely to lead to many cases that could be heard by tribunals going to the High Court in the first instance. With insufficient time to make an informed decision or in some circumstances to gain access to information that is usually released only under freedom of information, lawyers will want to avoid risking actions against them for negligence. I talk about this from some experience, not in migration matters, but negligence on the part of lawyers and the medical profession has become more in vogue in recent years. Obviously, this has not been factored in. Any lawyer who is worried about the possibility of being sued for negligence, given the strict time limit available in which to go to the High Court, would, there is no doubt in my mind, file in the High Court, although probably not being properly prepared. Starting in the High Court may seem a safer bet as matters can be remitted back down the system but cannot move up the system if they miss the deadline.</para><para>It is neither appropriate for the High Court to be treated in this manner nor is it efficient use of the court system. With only seven justices on the High Court and almost no capacity to remit matters to the Federal Court, delays will run into years, if not perhaps even decades. It is nonsensical to suggest that these measures will reduce the volume of litigation in migration decisions or that costs to the Commonwealth would be reduced. On the contrary, if these measures lead to channelling an increased workload of migration cases to the High Court, costs that would arise from delays and indefinite extensions for unlawfuls to stay in Australia would also, logically, increase. We can hardly afford that, as we already have over 50,000 undetected overstayers living in the community. There are people being held in detention for long periods of time. Some might be able to get bridging visas and stay out of detention but there might also be additional detention costs. </para><para>Similarly, the measures to prevent class or group actions are equally, if not more, misguided. They are unlikely to stop proceedings that in substance but not form would be considered class actions. The Federal Court of Australia Amendment Act 1991, commenced in 1992, introduced class actions in the Federal Court. Class actions have been possible in the High Court since 1953. It is nonsense to advance an argument against the appropriateness of class actions in migration matters. The migration regulation structure is expressed in the language of classes of visa with common requirements and criteria, which of course apply to classes of persons and would logically therefore warrant class actions. </para><para>A class action is one in which a proceeding is brought on behalf of a group of persons with claims that arise from similar, identical or related circumstances and which raise substantially common questions of fact or law. If class actions were prevented, a lawyer would only need to make relatively small changes to effectively achieve the same results as a class action. With some class actions representing thousands of applicants, under the proposed new arrangements the court would be faced with either hearing thousands of individual but essentially similar cases or running one as the test case and then applying the same decision to the remaining cases. That sounds a reasonable proposition but this amounts to a de facto class action anyway, only more cumbersome and with greater associated red tape, costs and delays.</para><para>The argument that forcing lawyers to file individual cases would act as a deterrent because of the filing fees may have some force but will not deter any serious litigant because the court has the power to waive fees and almost always does, I understand, for impecunious applicants. There is anecdotal evidence to support claims by the minister that a small number of practitioners are running dubious class actions and are placing newspaper advertisements vigorously encouraging applicants to join class actions. Whilst the opposition does not in any shape or form support these people—if they are doing it simply for the purposes of making money— this is, nevertheless, how class actions against pharmaceutical companies and tobacco companies, et cetera get started. So, in many respects, what they are doing is not new. </para><para>Introducing such restrictive legislation seems an extreme measure to combat the alleged unethical conduct by some lawyers. If the conduct is unethical, it should be raised directly with the various disciplinary bodies. The irony is, however, that the same lawyers the minister is attacking are likely to be the first to adapt to these changes and further clog up the courts with the increased administration associated with filing individual cases. Nothing is going to stop these lawyers running the same matters as a slew of individual cases filed in the High Court. The courts already have powers to stay or dismiss vexatious or trivial applications. That applies to all actions including class actions. Further, if a member of the action cannot demonstrate a sufficiently common element to the relevant action, that member can be ruled out.</para><para>Ultimately, class actions are an efficient means of dealing with matters affecting many individuals with common complaints. Indeed, the restrictions may result in a multiplicity of actions that otherwise could have been dealt with in the one matter as a class action. The government claims it is concerned that members, by joining a class action, are immediately issued with a bridging visa for a period extending to 35 days after consideration of the case by the court. It claims that obtaining the bridging visa is, in itself, sufficient incentive for applicants with no relevant claim to join a class action. The changes will make this worse, not better. Even the government's own advice indicates its uncertainty that the proposed measures would have any material effect on the concerns repeatedly expressed by the minister. The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>For instance, if the bar on class, grouped or otherwise class actions does not increase the number of individual applications, the cost to the Commonwealth, including costs arising from members of these actions prolonging their stay in Australia, may be reduced. However, if the number of individual applicants increases, there may be an increase in litigation costs in addition to costs associated with each individual's prolonged stay in Australia.</para></quote><para>So even the explanatory memorandum makes it very clear—it says that in the event we are successful and are able to reduce the number of applications everything will be fine. So straightaway even the minister's own department is saying there is a chance that this might increase the number of applications that go to the High Court and courts. I want to congratulate the department or whoever it is that wrote that explanatory memorandum because they have got it spot on—if you like, they are watching their back. Blind Freddy can see that this is what will happen if you want to do something about stopping these so-called unethical lawyers— and they will argue the case, of course, that they are.</para><para>You will not do it by introducing bills like this, where you throw out the baby with the bath water. You have to do whatever is necessary to get the law societies of each of these states—or give more teeth to the Migration Agents Authority—to look at ways these people can be stopped. I abhor the practice of people advertising and saying to asylum seekers, or whoever, `If you pay $500 you can join this action.' There is an enormous amount of money to be made here. As I said, this is not being condoned at all but sometimes you have to give a reasonable response to the problem. It does not matter whether you are an asylum seeker or whether you are an ordinary citizen of this country, the fact is that under international law all of us are entitled to our day in court, if you want to go to court. Once you are here, you are entitled to your day in court.  </para><para>The fact is that this action would stop many people from having that day in court. Simply because we are trying to make sure that people do not go to these so-called lawyers that advertise is not a reason for us to get rid of class actions altogether. The minister, to his credit, told me yesterday that he had received alternative advice—and I will mention that in a second—from a legal consultant about what else could be done. One of my colleagues who will be speaking later on this bill will probably refer to that. The advice he received from the lawyers was in terms of what he could do to try to fix the problem by trying to regulate these lawyers that are being, in his words, `unethical'. The fact is that that does not change the situation at all.</para><para>The opposition believes that the real purpose of this bill is simply to advance the government's policy of restricting virtually all access to judicial review in migration related matters. The severe restriction or denial of judicial review raises questions regarding the principle of the separation of powers. But whatever their purpose, these provisions will backfire and create more delay, complexity and costs for those who go to clever or sometimes unscrupulous lawyers, while leaving those who do not with no safety net and no effective rights. The minister attempts to sell this to the public on the basis that all these appeals and this bill are doing is stopping judicial review for refugee matters or for those that may not have a proper claim to stay in this country. But the fact is that this would apply also to people who may be refused a visa from a high risk country, or an Australian resident or citizen who is not happy about the way that, for instance, the high risk factor list is being used. This is for all class actions for all migration matters, not just in the area of, say, asylum seekers.</para><para>Labor believes that the perceived life and death nature of the administrative decision making process in migration matters requires that special allowance should be made for unforeseen circumstances in making an application to the High Court, which is the court of last resort. The structure of this proposed legislation is driven solely by the government's ulterior motive of restricting access to judicial review in migration matters. The real issues at hand are the number of abuses of the current system by some unscrupulous migration lawyers, the impact of class actions on the workload of the High Court and the lengthy processing times confronting current applicants.</para><para>The government does not address these problems by attempting to introduce the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No. 2 (2000). Whether by design or unintentionally, this proposed legislation panders to those fringe sectors of society who maintain that immigrants and refugees are not entitled to the natural justice that is afforded to Australian citizens.</para><para>I believe that we should rise above that, and that the legislation that is presently before the House, debated and passed in this House, should be fair—all legislation in this House should be fair—and benefit all people who have a right to have their case heard in a court of law.</para><para>I refer to the dissenting report of the opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, signed by my colleagues Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, Julia Irwin, the member for Fowler, Senator Jim McKiernan, Senator for Western Australia and my friend Bernie Ripoll, member for Oxley. In their conclusion they say:</para><quote><para>Opposition Members of the Committee maintain that access to class actions should be retained because they are an equitable, economic and efficient avenue through which migration decisions can be challenged. Access to class actions should therefore not be restricted without good and convincing reasons.</para><para>Opposition Members have examined the arguments and evidence advanced for restricting access to class actions and have not found them convincing. We are prepared to examine any evidence of abuse and we will always act to curb or stop abuse when it is proven to be happening. The evidence was not presented on this occasion.</para><para>We are also very concerned that alternatives to the restriction of access to class actions have apparently not been canvassed. </para><para>We are concerned that the likely effects on the courts and on Commonwealth expenditure were not fully examined before the Bill was introduced.</para></quote><para>I did mention that the minister has advised me that he did seek legal advice on other alternatives, specifically for the purpose of trying to curb advertising by certain lawyers. That report says—according to the way he reads it—that that would be very difficult. My colleague the member for Denison will be speaking later in this debate and will be talking about that. I could not agree more with what appears in the conclusion of the dissenting report. It has been said very succinctly: the fact is that there is no evidence to substantiate the restriction of rights in this way.</para><para>The government might think that there is some political mileage in it. If you have got to go for political mileage by doing these sorts of things—well, it is a shame; it is an absolute shame. The fact is that this will not do what the minister wants it to do. He has obviously asked his advisers to come up with ways and means of trying to curb the problems that he sees coming from advertising from these migration agents and from migration lawyers. This is not the answer, Minister. I have said to the minister before that if he can come up with something which is reasonable he will get the support of the opposition. The minister's response, of course, is, `Well, what's your solution?' Well, I am not the minister. The opposition is not in government. You are the minister. You come up with the solutions and we will have a look at them—you have got the whole of the department plus advisers ad infinitum. All I have got is one person.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CU4</name.id><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gallus</name></talker><para>—Oh, tough.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name></talker><para>—Well, who are you?

That clearly shows that, once again, the opposition are not listening to the people of Australia and that they are not listening to what the community thinks and feels about the issue that this bill addresses. The shadow minister claims that there is no evidence to substantiate the problem. Late last year I took the trouble to visit a detention centre in Curtin in Western Australia. I wanted to see for myself what the detention centre was like, how the people in the centre were being treated and what the issues were. I came away with a very clear understanding that people were well looked after but that there was a number of people within the centre who were using every avenue possible to delay their stay in Australia for as long as possible and were encouraging others to become involved in what were no more than really artificial schemes. Of course, those delaying tactics cost the Commonwealth of Australia a lot of money. They are also clearly used by people who have come to Australia illegally, people who have jumped the queue, people who have used their own resources to get ahead of the genuine refugees whom we in Australia welcome in relation to our international obligations. So my first-hand experience, having seen the situation for myself, is that the parliament of Australia should be supporting this bill very much; but there is also the feeling of the majority of Australians that people should not be unreasonably able to use all sorts of legal devices to just extend their stay in Australia when they are here illegally in the first place. I reject out of hand the shadow minister's claims that in some way this is an attack on the rights of these people. I can confirm to the parliament that the rights of any individual remain unchanged. If an individual wants to take his or her case to the Federal Court or the High Court of Australia in whatever circumstances, he or she will be able to. In that sense the bill is therefore fair and does not deny natural justice, as was suggested by the shadow minister. </para></talk.start><para>This bill seeks to implement a number of government policy initiatives within the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio which will further ensure the `integrity' of Australia's immigration laws, and I think that is the mark of the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. If you looked for an adjective to describe the current minister, you would use the word `integrity'. The coalition's immigration policies have sought to achieve a proper balance between our social, economic, environmental and humanitarian objectives in a non-discriminatory way. That is very important. I think the Australian community understand that, and certainly it is very important to the government that it be non-discriminatory.</para><para>The initiatives in the bill stem from the government's policy to restrict access to judicial review in visa related matters in all but exceptional circumstances. The government's policy commitment to restrict access in these matters was given in light of the extensive merits review rights enshrined in the migration legislation. One major point of concern which I have picked up on is the ever increasing cost and incidence of migration litigation, with its associated delays in the removal of non-citizens from Australia. In 1999 it cost the taxpayers of this country more than $11 million and it is expected in the 2001-02 financial year to cost Commonwealth taxpayers more than $20 million, not including court costs. I ask the parliament, the opposition and the people of Australia this: surely there are better ways to utilise these massive amounts of money? Surely we could particularly spend this money on genuine refugees, not people who have jumped the queue, not people who are using artificial legal devices to remain in Australia at taxpayers' expense for as long as possible. Surely that is commonsense. Surely that is reasonable. But the opposition opposes something that seems to every other Australian to be commonsense, and that is sad.</para><para>There is a theory in the community that the class actions are being used to encourage large numbers of people to litigate with the aim of obtaining a visa. I have certainly seen that first-hand. I have seen the evidence, I know it happens and it is simply unacceptable. The changes in this bill are necessary to combat the recent increase in the use of class actions for people with no lawful authority to remain in Australia to prolong their stay and frustrate removal action. Most of those who participate in litigation would have no other option to obtain authority to remain in Australia and would hence be removed. I would like to inform the House of some statistics in relation to litigation. Those in the gallery who are listening this afternoon might also be interested in these figures. Currently there are 3½ thousand people in four class actions before the courts in Australia. Since October 1997, 14 class actions have been initiated. From these 14 class actions significant numbers of people have been able to obtain bridging visas to remain in Australia until the courts determine the matter. Ten class actions were decided by late last year, involving some 4,000 people, and were dismissed by the courts.</para><para>The bottom line of all of that is a lot of legal argy-bargy, delay and cost—with taxpayers footing the bill—all coming to a conclusion that everyone knew would happen before it actually started. Going through these long processes is becoming more and more a feature of our society these days. You see it in environmental investigations, you see it in the legal situation—you know what is going to happen before the process starts, and it costs an awful lot of money and the world does not move any further forward. In this instance, what is happening is that people are just using this as a device to remain in Australia when they should not be here. </para><para>I find this a disturbing trend, especially since the government's policy is to restrict access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances. We as a government do not rule out class actions altogether, as there may be some sound public policy objective for the availability of class actions in some matters. The problem, though, is that there is a substantial number of people who litigate for the sole purpose of getting a bridging visa so that they can stay longer in Australia. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, bridging visas have no work conditions attached to them. </para><para>The provisions in this bill ban class actions in visa related matters before both the Federal Court and the High Court. Furthermore, to deny those wishing to rush to the courts before the introduction of this legislation, provisions have sensibly been put in place that will subsequently be applied to all court applications made from when this bill was introduced by the minister. This bill also restricts those wishing to commence or to continue visa related proceedings in the Federal Court to cases where there is a person who is actually the subject of a decision or action. It is important to note, too, that this bill does not impose similar limits in relation to the High Court's original jurisdiction under section 75 of the Constitution. The bill does, however, stop the High Court from remitting such cases to the Federal Court, to prevent persons circumventing the restriction directly imposed on the Federal Court. While I understand the relationship between the court system and the parliament of Australia, there needs to be a time when the parliament, representing the people, makes very clear what the people of Australia feel and want. This bill addresses that feeling on this particular issue.</para><para>Recently, I was discussing this bill with some of my constituents who were concerned about immigration. Their major concern was that they believed the government wanted to abolish bridging visas. But denying litigants access to bridging visas is not the government's preferred option. Many people, though, would still take legal action if their bridging visas were denied, and these people, as a direct result, become unlawful non-citizens who are required to be taken into immigration detention. This move would put more strain on the current facilities and would increase detention costs, which are very difficult to recover—another impost on the Australian taxpayer. I certainly wanted to speak on this bill today: I wanted to support it, I wanted to make clear to the people in Townsville and Thuringowa that I am backing their view on this matter. I would ask the Labor Party to reconsider their opposition to addressing the problem of the misuse of the judicial process by non-citizens who are simply refusing to leave Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>23917</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My friend and colleague the shadow minister for immigration has spoken eloquently of our concerns about the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> insofar as it restricts access on the part of migrants to the court system in this country. Naturally, I share those concerns and fully endorse them. On this first parliamentary sitting day of the new millennium and of the Centenary of Federation year, I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the role of migrants in building this nation. I wish to speak of the importance of equality of opportunity, as it affects particularly the children of both migrant families and people from non-migrant backgrounds, to the formation of a decent, fair and harmonious society. To that end, I wish to move a second reading amendment in these terms: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House, at the beginning of the new millennium and during the Centenary of Federation:</para><para>(1)	acknowledges the invaluable role of migrants in building a fairer and more prosperous Australian nation; and</para><para>(2)	urges the government, in its pursuit of cost reductions in migration administration, to look at migration issues in a comprehensive manner and not to lose sight of the need to provide migrant families with equality of opportunity, especially educational opportunity, so that they have the best chance of contributing to the achievement of a fair, cohesive society”. </para></motion><para>Australia has been the beneficiary of a great postwar migration program. I should point out that this is not a program that was especially a skilled migration program. Some of the greatest contributors to the building of this nation arrived here as penniless refugees from war-torn Europe. We know the contribution of migrants from Europe, for example, in building the Snowy Mountains scheme, one of the greatest projects in this country and one of our greatest nation-building efforts. People like Sir Arvi Parbo and Peter Abeles arrived in this country penniless and with not much going for them in terms of their knowledge of the English language but they, too, made a great contribution to this country, as have countless thousands of migrants since that time—as I said, many of them unskilled migrants.</para><para>We cannot rely exclusively on a skilled migration program to continue building a great nation. It is a very competitive world out there, and it is all very easy for people to say, `We want only skilled migrants; we don't want unskilled migrants.' Many countries around the world are seeking skilled migrants, and they are not as easy to come by as people might suggest. I want to put to the parliament today that there is real value in a migration program that includes unskilled migrants, that includes, obviously on compassionate grounds, refugees and that, of course, includes family reunions.</para><para>Over the holiday break I was involved in a debate about our national anthem. On that I have very open views. I did want to—and I did at that time—point to the chorus of a song which I think is in every way terrific in paying tribute to the nation building efforts of migrants in this country, because the chorus of the song entitled <inline font-style="italic">I Am Australian</inline> goes:</para><quote><para>We are one, but we are many;</para><para>And from all the lands on earth we come.</para><para>We share a dream, and sing with one voice,</para><para>I am, you are, we are Australian.</para></quote><para>I think that captures the spirit of Australia very well. </para><para>Having said that, there is an issue of citizenship in this country. I note that the proportion of Australian citizens aged 18 and over in the population of my electorate of Rankin is just 57.6 per cent. That is a reflection of two things: (1) that the population of Rankin is very young and (2) that there are a lot of migrants who have not yet taken out Australian citizenship. I certainly will be launching a citizenship drive in Rankin. It is something that migrants who arrive here and spend some time in the country should contemplate—that is, making a commitment to the country by becoming Australian citizens.</para><para>The second part of the second reading amendment deals with equality of opportunity for both migrants and non-migrant children in this country, and I want to tell a story in that regard. Amy falls pregnant at 17. Ten years later she will have had three children to different fathers. At 27 Amy is a single parent, longing for a stable relationship, yearning for male companionship. But she is wary—she was beaten unconscious by her last de facto partner. Amy would love a career. But, you see, Amy left school at 15 and her hands are full with three children. The eldest boy is on medication for attention deficit disorder. Amy smokes, drinks and buys scratchies and lotto tickets. It helps relieve stress and break the tedium. And maybe one day she will have a big win, buy a nice house and take the kids on a holiday.</para><para>Jason lives under a bridge. He ran away from home at 14 after one too many bashings from his alcoholic father. Jason steals to finance his heroin habit. He wants to be a rock musician, but his dignity and confidence are shattered. Amy and Jason's fathers left school early after clashing with their teachers and principals. They could not read. They felt they just were not cut out for school. Amy's 10-year-old son hates school. He feels he is not cut out for it, like the grandfather he never knew. He is barely literate, so he is bored in the classroom and prefers to wag. </para><para>Amy and Jason live in Werribee and Woodridge, Mount Druitt and Sunshine, Elizabeth and Inala, along with the children of poor migrants who speak little English at home. They, and the Aboriginal children of Walgett and Woolloomooloo, Arukun and Doomadgee, are the lives behind the statistics, and the statistics reveal the truth: Australia is in the grip of an education recession. </para><para>Education is to the information age what coal was to the Industrial Revolution. Yet more than a million disadvantaged children like Amy and Jason are being locked out of the information age by government policies and the neglect that have created the education recession. Through its policies and rhetoric the conservative national government is widening and deepening the social divide. The education recession is not a recession we had to have. It was not inevitable that one-third of young Australians attending government schools should be dropping out of high school. It was not inevitable that young people from disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods, country towns and remote communities should be so heavily overrepresented in the early exodus from government schools. And it was not inevitable that government investment in education should be falling as a share of national income.</para><para>The conservative national government cannot clutch at claims that the slackening public investment effort is being taken up by rising private investment in education. National investment in education as a share of the economy is lower now than it was a decade ago. Like a general economic recession, the education recession is leaving a legacy of broken lives and wasted opportunities. As the economically advanced and emerging countries compete in the race towards excellence in the information age, Australia is stalled at the starting blocks, the sound of the starter's gun a remote thud in the ears of the conservative national government.</para><para>The nation is splitting into two sets of communities: those reaping rich rewards from adapting to the information age and those being locked out of it. In the 21st century affluent Australians will not ask how the other half live, because they will never have known them. Their children will never sit together in school or compete against them for the very best jobs the nation can offer. Angry and resentful at their exclusion from affluent Australia, the children of the excluded communities will take what they can get, carving out their own subcultures, turning to violence, using illicit drugs and stealing from affluent neighbourhoods to finance their addictions.</para><para>Affluent Australia responds, calling for more jails and longer sentences, building higher walls in their enclaves and installing louder burglar alarms. Is this the sort of society we want—divided, intolerant and spiteful? The conservative message to the affluent aspiring middle class is that they are being held back by the indolent, the lazy, the drinkers, the smokers and the bludgers. Another bottle of fine red mellows the conscience of affluent Australia, muffling the cries of Amy and Jason, the children of poor migrants and all of the suffering and disheartened children of abandoned Australia.</para><para>The conservative national government has taken wedge politics to an art form. Just last year the member for Batman in a speech entitled `Skills, location, population: bringing them together' on 6 March made this remark:</para><quote><para>I also want to stress today that we are prepared to look at flexibility in family reunion arrangements to attract skilled migrants and businesses to our region.</para></quote><para>On that the immigration minister arranged a dorothy dixer from the member for Petrie, Ms Teresa Gambaro—who should know better. In response to that dorothy dixer he said:</para><quote><para>If you are out there arguing that the brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and parents can come to Australia as part of a family reunion scheme to get skilled migrants here without testing them against the labour market, make it very clear because, brother, you will all be in trouble in your electorates if that is what you are advocating.</para></quote><para>That is the art of wedge politics, and the nation is suffering as a result of it. Only a Labor government steeped in the traditions of fairness, equality of opportunity and nondiscrimination can lead an education recovery and repair our fractured society. Those Labor traditions are deeply rooted in the tree of knowledge in outback Barcaldine. Striking shearers, their wages cut without negotiation, gathered in solidarity under the tree of knowledge to determine how best to restore their working conditions. They sought to muster industrial strength through solidarity but were repressed by a conservative state government invoking an 1825 English conspiracy law—since repealed in England but still on the statute books in Queensland. Many shearers were dragged around in chains. A judge abused police for failing to open fire; badgered the jury for three days, ignoring their pleas for clemency; and sentenced 12 shearers to three years gaol for conspiracy. Determined to pursue social justice through parliamentary means following the defeat of the shearers' strike, the organised labour movement inserted into its earliest manifestos the funding of education for the children of working families. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CU4</name.id><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gallus</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

If the member for Rankin wants to enter migration debates and try to talk about seeds pollinating all around the country—perhaps the seeds of a socialist rose—I think it is also right for the member for Rankin to give a true and accurate reflection of the Australian Labor Party's growth in the area of migration and their late embracing of a far more universal concept than the White Australia Policy that they held dear to their hearts for about 40 years.</para></talk.start><para>This government has proved by its own actions that it has no such thing as an exclusion based on race. It is in fact a government that has encouraged the very best people from all around the world.

The preconditions are well known to those of us who enter these discussions and those of us who represent in this place people who have migrated to this country.</para><para>Those simple conditions are: do they have something to offer to Australia? Do they bring with them some skills, some abilities, something that we could make good use of in our ongoing journey to build a great country—an even greater one than we currently have? Do they perhaps bring some of the fabric of a family that is missing from those who are currently here? That in itself is a major contribution to the cause. But of course the two strict conditions that are applied to all who apply to come to Australia, either as visitors or, for that matter, as permanent residents or ongoing migrants to live and become citizens here, are whether or not they are dealing—<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed) </inline></para><para>That quorum called by the member for Dickson is a disgrace.

As I was trying to say, the member for Rankin was trying to selectively quote history with regard to the Labor Party's credentials in this particular area. He was the one who introduced the debate and the particular subject matter that seems to have upset the member for Dickson so much. As I said, this is all about a nation-building exercise; it is all about ensuring that those who were born here in Australia are satisfied that those who choose to come here to live, or those who seek refuge here, are here on fair and equal terms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I attempted to say before the honourable member for Dickson churlishly called a quorum, the two basic credentials demanded of all those who travel to Australia and who seek to live in this country is that they be of good character and in good health—in other words, that there is no downside to their travelling to and residing in Australia. That sends an important signal to those in our community who are encouraged by the politically correct debate that the Australian Labor Party continues to generate. During his contribution, the honourable member for Rankin spoke of those who do not want anyone to migrate to this country. Some in our community say that those who arrive on our shores as refugees should meet with one of three responses: their boat should be shot out of the water, they should be shot on sight or they should be detained and sent back to their point of origin on the very next plane. They are the sorts of nonsense arguments that we hear in the community and, as those opposite attempt to promulgate splittist politics, we may hear them from many more people.</para><para>Fortunately, this government does not practise such politics. This government believes people are entitled to an opportunity to put their case for staying in Australia. The only trouble is—the honourable member for Bowman outlined the defence case for the legal profession and migration agents in Australia—that there are those who seek to exploit both the basic rule of law in this country and our generosity, particularly regarding refugees. Such people advertise in the ethnic press inviting others to add their names to class actions, promising that, by so doing, they will be granted permission to stay in Australia for ever and a day. At the same time—the honourable member for Bowman mentioned this point—the High Court faces a backlog in considering such class actions. It is backlogged to billyo and back by people making cases to stay in Australia even though they arrived without papers or any proof of who or what they are. How can we determine whether such people are genuine refugees? It is a major problem that this government must contend with. </para><para>Migration agents, lawyers and, it seems from the debate so far, some of those opposite are perhaps unwittingly offering succour to those who trade in human misery. Such people are running around underprivileged parts of the world where people get not a day in court but a moment in front of a brick wall before they are shot, saying, `Pay me money and I will get you to Australia. By the way, when you get there, a bunch of people will try to ensure that you never have to leave. Don't worry about the rules because the Australian Labor Party will do all it can to dissemble the facts,' creating expectations that can never be realised.</para><para>What is the reaction in the broader community? It is one of great frustration as Australians witness an attack on the integrity of their migration system, which aims to attract to this country and give a home to people with something to offer and people of high integrity and in good health. This nation has grown from a few million people to 20 million in the past 40 or 50 years. We have trusted people to come to Australia and do the right thing. It is poor politics for those opposite to come to this place and attempt to create the false impression that this government is being cruel, hard or unnecessarily difficult in responding to those who come to our shores by means other than through the official system and seek refuge in this country. It is cruel and unfair to my constituents who sat in the refugee camps in Kakuma outside Nairobi waiting for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and that system to work and give them a ticket to freedom and opportunity in Australia. It is unfair to those who come to our shores via the system and who are tarred with the same brush of mistrust and disbelief and made to feel unwelcome by many in our community. </para><para>Integrity of the immigration system is the key to all legislation that this government has brought before parliament over the years. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has maintained the integrity of that system in everything he has done. He has maintained a sense of balance so that those who were born here and who proudly call themselves Australian can be satisfied that everyone who comes through our doors to claim Australian citizenship does so for all the right reasons. It is important that those who come to this country know that they have jumped through all the hoops, climbed all the barricades and survived the hassles, bureaucratic nonsense and obfuscation and the perils of the process. They can hold their heads high as there is absolutely no doubt that they are here for the right reasons. </para><para>Perhaps people come to Australia with particular skills or in order to mend the fabric of families that have been without caring parents or grandparents. Perhaps they come to this country as refugees with little or no possessions and find welfare, housing, health and a helping hand from their local community. I am privileged to represent in this place many of those who have come to Australia from diverse parts of the world. Some have come from Russia and eastern European countries in recent years. Some have survived all sorts of human tragedies—which I cannot even bear to imagine—in the Horn of Africa, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Sudan and Kenya. Such people, who are very proud of their noble cultural traditions, have found that they can, slowly but surely, build a life in Australia. </para><para>The people in the suburbs of Annerley, Moorooka, Fairfield and Yeronga come in contact with them more often than do people from other suburbs in my area. Did I mention Tarragindi? I should have. People in those suburbs, those areas close to the city, are finding a sea of people from the Horn of Africa now living amongst them and have been very generous in the welcome they have afforded—so much so that, when the combined churches of Moorooka held their annual Christmas carol service late last year, appropriately, they took up a collection and made the proceeds available to help African refugees, particularly African refugee women. It was only a few hundred dollars, but on that night the point was made that at a Christian event assistance may be given to those who are of a different faith—of Islamic faith. Just as Jesus Christ's parents found a place in an inn for his birth on the first Christmas, so too have many refugees found a place in parts of my electorate—and in other parts of Australia. </para><para>This legislation points out that there are those who are willing to prey on in the worst possible way and offer false hope to some who are in the system, which is very slowly and tediously dealing with their claim to stay here. When I find out that some people are trying to turn a dollar by this and advertise in newsletters and in various parts of the ethnic press, it turns my stomach in the extreme. The member for Bowman says that nothing in these measures will stop that from occurring. He claims it will make matters worse. But one of the things that will come out of these measures is a very simple message to the countries of origin of those who seek to go around the well-established system for refugees that is administered by the United Nations. The message is very clear: you cannot expect to stay in Australia for years and years and then get your day in court or to come here without a set of papers in your hand. A lot of dreadful people undertake nefarious activities, human misery activities, by importing people illegally into this country, telling them to dispose of their papers. Why? Because it makes it harder for the system to deal with them—to make an assessment and process them—and decide one way or the other, whether they are in or out of Australia. </para><para>This legislation will send a very strong signal that Australia is very fair dinkum about giving a fair go to those who are prepared to do the right thing but is equally fair dinkum about ensuring that those who are doing the wrong thing will not be rewarded with something that should be very precious to each and every one of us: citizenship and the right to stay in Australia.</para><para>There have been suggestions of bringing in some sort of limit to the amount of time for appeals after the process has been gone through, the tribunals have made their assessment and people have been given their chance to appeal. This never-ending appeal process now has an end. There is a 35-day period in which you must appeal to the High Court. This is a very fair measure indeed. At the heart of it is the integrity of the system. This is not just about keeping certain people in certain groups in our community feeling as though they are well serviced. I am talking about the migration agents and the lawyers who are making a dollar or 20 out of this whole process of human misery. It is very much about saying to the broad community that every person who is here as a migrant, every person who is here as a refugee, is here for the right reasons, is here on the same footing as somebody who was born here. Let me paraphrase the words of a great fellow in my electorate, Tom Chow of Sunnybank. When he received a community service award on Australia Day, he thanked the 400 or so people at D.M. Henderson Park at MacGregor and said words to this effect: `As an adopted Australian brother, I want to say to you how proud I am to live in this country, how pleased I am to have enjoyed a great sense of fair go, how optimistic I am about the future of this country and how much I want to continue to contribute to it.'</para><para>That is what this whole debate about migration should be about. We should not allow people who came to this place in the last parliament to get up and quote Labor's lousy old White Australia aficionado Arthur Calwell in maiden speeches. That is what Pauline Hanson did. She got up and quoted Arthur Calwell. That is why I walked out on her maiden speech. If my memory serves me correctly, she spoke between the member for North Sydney and the then member for Dickson, Tony Smith. I stayed for the first six minutes, heard the outrageous quotes of Arthur Calwell reworked in 1996 and walked out. I was the first member on either side to do so. </para><para>Those opposite want to start revisiting history, as the member for Rankin did in his very poor performance today. I thought his preselection was over and done with. It sounded like something to keep the Labor Party hacks in Brisbane happy, not something that should be said in a national parliament. If those opposite want to revisit that, let us revisit the White Australia Policy and condemn Labor for its silly old policy in the past. This bill is about something a lot more positive than that. I am pleased to speak to it and I commend it to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>23925</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the shadow minister for immigration in opposing <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000.</inline> This bill is the latest in a series of changes that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has made to the migration regulations since coming to office four years ago. In essence, this bill seeks to deny justice to visa applicants who believe they have a legitimate case to put before the courts. The bill is so controversial that I am sure it raised the hackles of more than a few government MPs with legal training—so much so that I believe they were probably quite relieved to see it whisked off to a committee last year. Many of them probably wish it would stay there permanently. </para></talk.start><para>This bill needs to be viewed in the wider context of the human rights meltdown that is taking place on the government front bench. The Australian government's actions and inaction in the field of human rights over the last 12 months in particular give we Australians cause to hang our heads in shame. This is a government that refuses to put a stop to the mandatory sentencing of young, mainly indigenous people in the Northern Territory over trivial offences. How can any fair-minded person accept that theft of a crayon or a bottle of cordial is anything more than a misdemeanour; yet the Northern Territory deems all property offences to be criminal acts.</para><para>When this issue came before the House last year, the crocodile tears coming from the moderates on the other side of the House were laughable.

As Australians, we are proud of our role in setting up treaty committees. The government, however, seems to think that these treaties were not designed to criticise us—just all the other countries that violate human rights. But close scrutiny of the government's treatment of indigenous Australians and onshore asylum seekers is not something it welcomes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government is also in the business of legitimising the rule of indicted war criminals, much to the chagrin of western European countries and the US. For example, when the rest of the world was condemning Slobodan Milosevic as a war criminal, the government sent Charles Stuart, our new ambassador to Yugoslavia, to meet him within days of him taking up his new post. In September last year the people of Yugoslavia spoke loud and clear when they handed the presidency to Vojislav Kostunica. But wait; there's more. As a final insult to indigenous Australians, the government has tried to deny the stolen generations.</para><para>The fact is that this bill is yet another example of the government's attempts to restrict the rights of its citizens and of people who believe they have a case for permanent residence. You only have to look at the appalling conditions in immigration detention centres all over Australia to see that this government is doing all it can to act tough over the issue of asylum seekers. In places like Woomera and Port Hedland we had cases of young children being put in conditions about which they said they would rather go back to their country of origin and face potential death than put up with.</para><para>There are two sections of this bill that I wish to speak on. Schedule 1, part 1, of the bill seeks to introduce a new part to the Migration Act. Under part 8A, section 486A will set a 28-day absolute time limit on applications to the High Court for judicial review. Setting such a time limit is a contentious act. Section 75(v) of the Constitution states that, in all matters in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth, the High Court shall have original jurisdiction. The 28-day time limit constricts a person's ability to seek leave of the High Court, and as such this bill is contentious and it can be argued that it interferes with the exercise of judicial power. There is something that we Australians hold sacred in our Constitution and that is the separation of powers. The basic premise is that the legislature should not interfere with the judiciary. It is hardly surprising, however, that the government seeks to interfere in this case, given that its inaction has given tacit support to the Northern Territory legislature's interference in its judiciary with the imposition of mandatory sentencing. So, while there is no question that this bill is just another example of a mean-spirited government, there is a big question over the legality of these proposed changes. While the government may have received advice that this provision is valid, the comments of Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice McHugh in the case of Abebe would suggest otherwise. The justices said: </para><quote><para>But once a question arises as to whether a Commonwealth officer has acted lawfully or within or outside the jurisdiction conferred upon him or her, no law of the Parliament can curtail the jurisdiction of this Court to decide the issue, ...</para></quote><para>This is why I am pleased to support the shadow minister's amendment. The rationale behind this bill is to discourage a person from taking his or her case to the High Court, thus reducing the workload of the High Court. However, the bill is just as likely to produce the opposite effect. Solicitors may decide to start their cases in the High Court in order to get in before the 28-day cut-off. Matters can always be remitted back down the system, and this may well become the most pragmatic option. So the bill may actually be responsible for clogging up the courts even more.</para><para>I accept that in the majority of cases the department and the tribunals make accurate and fair decisions. However, it is a fact that officers of the Commonwealth occasionally get things wrong, and this was a point that was not lost on the people who drafted our Constitution. I might add that it is not a point lost on this minister, who has intervened more than any of his predecessors to grant ministerial discretion, and in many of those cases I welcome the minister's decision to do that. But you cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, `I have a right as a minister to intervene because the system gets it wrong,' and then at the same time try to restrict people's legal options. The court system allows people with a genuine case to seek justice. Therefore setting a 28-day limit on accessing the High Court interferes with the pursuit of natural justice.</para><para>I believe there is another agenda at play here in this bill. This bill is part of the minister's mission to limit the access that non-citizens have to judicial review. It is the minister's belief that all court action is taken purely to stretch out a non-citizen's illegitimate attempt to remain in Australia. Whilst in some cases that might be true, it is certainly not true in all cases, and these are the people who deserve their day in court.</para><para>Schedule 1, part 2, of the bill is also of great concern to me. Here the minister seeks to prevent representative, grouped or class actions relating to visas and decisions to deport and remove unlawful non-citizens from being heard in the Federal Court and High Court. The rationale behind class actions is to prevent drawn-out legal processes by allowing people in the same circumstances to present one case instead of multiple cases. The minister is very dismissive of such actions. In keeping with his belief that all applications are vexatious, the minister wants to close this right of appeal as well. I concede that some class actions have been frivolous, but many others have not. When introducing this bill to the House last year, the minister stated that of the 14 class actions that have been commenced since October 1997, the 10 that have been decided were dismissed. What the minister conveniently failed to mention was the success of Fazal Din v. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in the Federal Court. Clearly not all class actions are vexatious. Even when class actions are unsuccessful, it does not mean they are without merit. In the case of Macabenta v. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the justices of the High Court were not unanimous in their ruling, ruling in favour of the minister by two to one. In other words, one justice of the High Court was prepared to grant leave to appeal. David Bennett QC, who represented the applicants, had this to say: </para><quote><para>The issues raised are novel and important issues arising in the law of racial discrimination and in my view the applicants were well justified in bringing the proceedings.</para></quote><para>David Bennett is now the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, so I would have thought that even the minister must have some respect for his opinions. There were approximately 3,500 people involved in this particular class action. Clearly there was merit in their case and, as a result, these people would have been justified in pursuing their individual cases—3,500 people clogging up the courts to litigate a common question when only one decision needed to be made. This bill does nothing to rationalise the cost of court action. In reality it may well have the opposite effect. Even the explanatory memorandum concedes this point. The minister is dismissive of the use of the courts by appellants seeking to have their migration cases heard. However, he is not averse to using the judicial process when it suits him. To quote from the department's annual report of 1998-99, the minister sought judicial review of 34 portfolio tribunal decisions, appealed to the full Federal Court in 26 matters, and sought special leave to appeal to the High Court in eight matters. This bill would seem to be a case of `Do as I say, not as I do.' I have no doubt there are many members of the government backbench who are privately very uncomfortable with the changes contained in this bill, just like they are uncomfortable with a government that says it is legitimate to inject people in detention centres, like something out of some bad rerun of World War II.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>23927</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>23927</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>La Trobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para> (<inline font-weight="bold">Hon.

Let us have a look at some of the things which have been wound back. First of all we had the three-year waiting period, a measure which has seen a number of migrants to this country left in poverty, left homeless and left relying on charity to provide the basic essentials of life. With regard to refugees, we have seen them vilified. We have seen a linking of the onshore applications with offshore applications so that the minister has been able to go around and say, `These people who are applying onshore are illegal,' which is not true and he knows it is not true under the United Nations definition of refugees. We have seen a minister who has said that people should wait in an orderly way in the queue overseas, when he knows that is simply not possible for people from countries such as Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime is abhorrent to any decent democratic person who supports human rights. To suggest that it is possible to wait in orderly queues in some of those countries is simply not feasible. We have seen, with that linking, the minister arguing that these people are taking the places of those people who are applying offshore. That is only the case because the minister has linked those two numbers which previously were not linked. That is consistent with the vilification that has occurred. These people have been branded as illegal. They have been branded as criminals and drug peddlers, when there is no evidence that the refugees themselves are in that situation. </para><para>The fact is that the Labor Party, and anyone who supports the plight of refugees, does not support the people smugglers, who are prepared to make profit out of people's misery. That is not in question, and action against people smugglers is something that I support. However, the vilification of the refugees themselves that has occurred is entirely inappropriate, and the treatment of these detainees is entirely inappropriate. My colleague the member for Chifley, Roger Price, has pointed out in articles published this week that a three-year-old boy and his father have been held in isolation in a dark, dank hellhole at Port Hedland detention centre. This man was being punished for a hunger strike, and he and his three-year-old son were held for 14 days in Third World conditions in a locked cell in the isolation block. What sort of nation are we that in the year 2001 tolerates that in order to appeal to some rednecks in our society? What sort of society are we when we have a minister who advocates giving people injections and drugging them—a minister of the crown who once stood up for human rights and has the hide to wear an Amnesty International badge on his lapel? </para><para>Many of these detention centres are run by private enterprise, but the only growth in building and construction announced by this government in three budgets has been the building of detention centres. Other countries do not do that. There are more people going to countries such as Italy in a week than come into Australia and make onshore applications in a year. Yet this minister pretended that there were whole villages packing up and coming to Australia. What happened to them? They did not arrive. We hear very little from this minister about the hundreds of people who have been so desperate that they have drowned, people who have died on their way to Australia. That shows the desperation of these people. It also shows the callousness of the people smugglers who are involved, but let us not blame the victims of oppression in reactionary regimes such as Afghanistan for wanting a better life. </para><para>The Vietnamese boat people who came in the 1970s have made an outstanding contribution to Australian society. Just as some people objected to that occurring on narrow, bigoted grounds, so this minister is prepared to appeal to the bigots, to the point where he goes overseas and says, `If you come here, you will be the subject of racist attacks. You are not welcome. This is an intolerant society.' That is what the minister said when he toured these countries. But it is not uniform because the minister has also made a decision to grant 200 special applications to members of the SLA, the South Lebanon Army—people who were engaged in militant conduct and violence against the people of south Lebanon on behalf of the Israeli occupation. That occupation had been roundly condemned and, under UN resolution 425, finally Israel has withdrawn. These people can be settled either where they are in Israel or in other parts of Lebanon, but no, we have a special category introduced.</para><para>Those 200 special applications will result in many more than 200 people coming here. What do they have in common? What they have in common is an extreme right-wing view. They are people who have been involved with the Falangists in Lebanon and have been responsible for violence against the Lebanese people. Yet that is okay, according to the government: `We will open up immigration for them because they may settle in marginal seats and will tend to support the conservative side of politics.' Many of them are right-wing reactionaries, but that is okay, according to the government. This minister has compassion for those people but not for women escaping places where they have enforced clitoridectomies and such barbaric behaviour. It is time that the minister stopped the vilification of refugees. It is time that we Australians reasserted ourselves as a compassionate nation, in recognition of the fact that we are the country we are because, whether people be Irish Catholics or Vietnamese refugees or any other race, wherever they have come from, people have come to Australia and made it the great country that it is today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>23929</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>. The member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, said earlier that many on the coalition side are uncomfortable. Let me assure him: I am not uncomfortable at all. This bill meets the expectations of my constituents perfectly. I will deal with the comments from the member for Grayndler later.</para></talk.start><para>To given an overview of the aims of the bill and the work that the minister is doing, non-citizens or illegal immigrants who may have been unsuccessful asylum seekers have been using the extensive merits review rights enshrined in the migration legislation to allow them to appeal to the Federal Court and the High Court on visa related matters. The view in my electorate is very much: send them home. Labor being soft on illegal immigrants and non-citizens will not get them elected to any seat in North Queensland. There are two matters of concern at present. One is the cost of and the increase in migration litigation. Last year, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs spent $11 million. They are projected to spend $20 million in 2001-02 in litigious actions, and that does not include the operating cost of the court. To remedy this situation, the minister has introduced the <inline ref="S193">Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2000]</inline>. It has a privative clause which reduces non-citizens' and illegal immigrants' recourse to the Federal Court and the High Court on visa related matters. Of course, this prolongs the proceedings. At the same time, they are eligible for Medicare and other benefits. Sixty per cent of the Federal Court's work is involved in court actions brought by non-citizens. </para><para>Unfortunately, this bill has been languishing in the Senate, thanks to the ALP and the Democrats, since 1998. I have let this fact be known widely to people in my electorate. Everybody knows that the ALP is soft on illegal immigrants. The second matter is that not only is there a great deal of litigious action but there is an alarming trend now to mount court challenges in migration matters through class or group actions. The aim is for large numbers of people to take action obtaining a visa and, again, to prolong their stay in Australia. I want to make it clear that the actions are by people who have no lawful right to stay in Australia. They are not refugees. They are non-citizens. They are illegal immigrants. They are queue jumpers, jumping ahead of those who have adopted a lawful approach to seeking visas or residency in Australia. If it were not for these class actions, these people would be removed.</para><para>Let me share with the House a history of class actions. Since October 1997, there have been 14 class actions—the aim being of course to get bridging visas to remain in Australia. Although these bridging visas do not allow non-citizens to work, many of them in fact may work illegally. So what number of these class actions have been successful? None. Ten actions, involving 4,000 participants, have been dismissed by the courts.</para><para>The member for Grayndler mentioned the Fazal Din case in 1997. This was a technical case that allowed litigants to take, again, an English speaking test, which some passed and some did not. He also mentioned the Macabenta outcome. It was only decided two to one, so obviously some of the judges did not agree. The reality is that it was still the outcome. It was an unsuccessful outcome. Another major concern is that these class actions have developed a pattern of people moving from one class action to another in order again to prolong their stay. I would like to share with the House the opening statement made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. They mentioned this pattern of litigants moving from one class action to another and that in the Macabenta class action `40 per cent or more of its members were identified as moving between class actions'. In other words, if you cannot succeed in one, move to another and prolong your stay. Maria Macabenta is a case in point as she is now a member of the Ly class action. Ms Macabenta originally challenged her protection visa refusal in July 1996 in the Federal Court. The matter was finalised on 11 July 1997. The class action known as Macabenta commenced on 24 October 1997 and was finalised on 18 June 1999.</para><para>We are now four years down the track for the date of Ms Macabenta's original application for a protection visa and its refusal, and Ms Macabenta is still in Australia on a bridging visa granted to her as a member of the Ly action. The Ly class action commenced on 10 June 1999 and is yet to be finalised. As a member of that class action, Ms Macabenta can remain in Australia until that action is concluded. This is an appalling example of how these class actions are being exploited and abused.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Nehl, Garry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Nehl</name></talker><para>—The goldmines for greedy lawyers. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name></talker><para>—Exactly.

What sum of taxpayers' money is involved? I am pleased that the member for Batman, as the only responsible member of the opposition, has raised these concerns. What sum of taxpayers' money has been spent? How many class actions have been mounted? How many clients are involved and at what stage are the class actions? It is obvious that the member for Batman is as concerned as we are that these class actions will enable non-citizens to stay in Australia and in many cases take work away from Australians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DG4</name.id><name role="metadata">Fischer, Tim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tim Fischer</name></talker><para>—Queuejumpers.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name></talker><para>—Exactly—queuejumpers.

I wish to address both these proposed legislative amendments, for the jurisprudence in both these decisions are related but separate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important that this House focuses on the moral reasoning behind the proposed amendments tonight. Moral reasoning requires an examination of goods, reflection on empathy and application of right reason. I turn first to the bill's constriction of judicial review appeals to the High Court. What `goods' are in issue here? In his second reading speech of 14 March 2000 on this bill, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, explains that the government's stated policy is to restrict access to judicial review in visa related matters in `all but exceptional circumstances'. What is striking about the minister's comment is that it is unclear what `exceptional circumstances' is supposed to mean. In pragmatic terms, we need go no further than read the commentary in <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 140 in order to understand the rationale latent in this bill. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> notes the good the government seeks, as the moral end of this bill, to ameliorate against increasing costs and incidence of migration litigation. </para><para>But what other goods are in issue here? There are many goods that are potentially trammelled or in direct competition to the stated good of amelioration of court costs to the Commonwealth. These competing goods include loss of rights to procedural fairness as embedded in the executive's power under its judicial review jurisdiction; loss of rights of appeal absolute in the hands of the visa applicant, either alone or as a class; and loss of the executive's power absolute, as it is further restricted or eliminated altogether by prohibitive legislative instrument. These three goods are fundamental to our democratic heritage. Tonight I would like to address each of these three competing goods specifically before drawing an analogy to the economic, utilitarian good of cost cutting as expressed by the minister for immigration. </para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> is heavy with discussion on the possible constitutional impacts of this bill, especially with respect to section 75(v) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> notes that, by virtue of this provision, judicial review of migration decisions comes within the original jurisdiction of the High Court. The question put by the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> is therefore most prudent:</para><quote><para>Does the imposition of absolute time limits on applications to the High Court for judicial review impermissibly interfere with the exercise of federal judicial power?</para></quote><para>I would clarify this question slightly, in that there is a slight error in the question. That is, the power in question is not judicial but executive in nature. For the exercise of judicial review, jurisdiction is akin to the judiciary as agent for the executive in the exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction. What is the relevance of this point to the question at hand about which good must prevail? The answer is that it is the executive power that is the good in competition with this government's so-called policy of costs and court access minimisation. It is the application of the government's so-called policy of jurisdictional denial and cost cutting that trammels the executive's right to review the administrative processes that are a creature of the legislature.</para><para>This raises one fundamental question: what perspective does the government have in respect of the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and its courts? When one reads section 75(v) again, one realises that we are expressly talking about two powers of law that the executive may wield. They are the prerogative writs of mandamus and prohibition, and the inherent right of the Crown to order interlocutory relief through injunction. The question of perspective of original power used to be a question of that very thing called `prerogative'. `Prerogative' in the specific constitutional context is defined in the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline> as:</para><quote><para>The right of the Sovereign, theoretically subject to no restriction, exercised in Australia by the Governor-General and governors.</para></quote><para>The word `prerogative' comes from the Latin, prerogativa, meaning to be `asked first'. This is an important definition because this reminds us that the sovereign's prerogative is theoretically subject to no restriction at all. This is as true today as it was before the enactment of the Constitution. Therefore, it is submitted that, even if a law may attempt to restrict the prerogative of the executive, it may be constitutionally precluded from doing so. In my view, this is why the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> correctly notes:</para><quote><para>While the Government clearly does not consider that the Bill interferes with the judicial power of the Commonwealth, this question is perhaps one over which constitutional lawyers may be divided.</para></quote><para>What is `original jurisdiction' anyway? There is section 75, but original jurisdiction transcends mere statutory interpretation. To understand our constitutional law, it is necessary to go to the doctrine of positive law in order to gain a fuller understanding of the powers that are being spoken of here tonight. It is like the Olympic torch: it never goes out. You can move the torch, you can pass it on from one to another, you can increase or decrease the intensity of the torch, but you can never extinguish the torch. So it is with constitutional law and the Governor-General's prerogative. The government—and, I must confess, the amendments of 1992—make the fatal mistake of believing that they can legislate out the positive law that is inherent in the original jurisdiction of the executive. That is, notwithstanding the existence of section 75 and the existence of this bill, there will always remain the residual, theoretically limitless powers of the executive, the Governor-General, by his agent, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, in holding all powers bestowed, contracted or expanded, modified or retained by the legislature. </para><para>However, whatever the legislature may pass by bill in this parliament, we are still left with the executive's prerogative, which resides as a residual power. It is an indestructible, immutable thing. It would take an entirely different jurisprudence to eliminate it, and, quite frankly, that just will not happen because reason demands that it cannot ever happen. For the prerogative jurisdiction of the High Court acting as the executive's agent in the application of its judicial review jurisdiction remains just that—an agent which administers a very small part of the executive's total and theoretically limitless power. It is for this reason that it is entirely incorrect for any person, whether they be a member of this House or a member of the public generally, to form the opinion that original jurisdiction flows directly from the statute as if the legislature alone were the ultimate source of the authority of positive law.</para><para>For what is the authority under which the Governor-General holds his prerogative power? He represents the Crown; he does not represent the people. We do. That does not mean that the legislature should immediately hold that same power even though the Governor--General acts on the advice of the Executive Council, which is in turn composed of the Governor-General as Chairman of the Executive Council along with his ministers. Even if the Executive Council were to cease to exist and the Constitution and all its enabling provisions of Australian and Imperial law were repealed, the Crown's prerogative would remain. Like an elastic band that was stretched, the elastic band would simply snap back to its original length. So it is with prerogative power.</para><para>I say this tonight in the context of this bill. The bill intends to further delimit the powers of the executive by further limiting the ability of a person to have access to that power. With great respect, the polarity or direction of this entire line of reasoning is wrong. It is wrong because this reasoning seeks to focus on delimiting the natural rights of a person to justice, rather than on addressing the justice that is latent in the hands of the person. Put clearly, the string of legislative amendments to the Migration Act has consistently sought to delimit and ultimately deny a visa applicant, sponsor or other designated person their natural rights to appeal to, first, the Federal Court in 1992 and, now, the High Court in the year 2001. This progressive delimiting of access to judicial review is, as we have noted, simply a cost-cutting exercise designed to delimit a perceived string of actions known as `abuse' cases. The word `abuse' is not my word but the word used in inverted commas in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. It connotes a system whereby vexatious litigants, or litigants seeking to stretch their visas to the limit, seek to remain in Australia as long as they possibly can. Unfortunately, the legitimate cases are thrown out with the illegitimate ones. Is it not the better solution to look at legislative means which address the natural rights and natural obligations of would-be litigants rather than attempt to statutorily prohibit appeals to either the Federal or the High Court?</para><para>In terms of goods, then, there are conspicuous winners and losers in this bill. The winner is the government and the judiciary: the government saves money and the judiciary can limit a growing courts list of immigration cases. The losers are the individual applicants, sponsors, et cetera. So, too, the executive loses more power at the hands of the judiciary and the legislature. Australia's three-tiered separation of powers of legislature, judicature and executive relies on finely balancing these powers. To limit one of these tiers in favour of another or others is to seriously imbalance these powers.</para><para>We are empathetic to the cries of the courts; they are overburdened. Civil society is not as a whole very empathetic to the amount of work that is undertaken in our courts. I have a great deal of respect for the pressures and workloads of our judiciary. A prudent and functional judiciary should not be overtaxed with work and should have a workload that is appropriate to the needs of dispensing justice. However, this bill is not the way to go about reducing litigation. The bill seeks to reduce litigation in the High Court by simply locking the gates of justice and throwing away the key. It is a statutory lock-out of potential litigants by creating prohibitive changes to the Migration Act.  </para><para>In particular, the bill seeks to amend a number of elements of the said act. It proposes amendments in line with Justice Weinberg's interpretation of subsection 485(3) of the Migration Act in the case A v. Pelekanakis, 1999, FCA 236. The proposed part 8A of the Migration Act restricts court proceedings in time to lodge with the insertion of a new section 486A, which limits days to appeal to 28 days for a writ of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari—another prerogative writ—or equitable reliefs of declaration or injunction. A new subsection 486A(2) denies the High Court from extending the new 28-day deadline. New section 486C introduces locus standi provisions by defining which people have authority to commence proceedings. Finally, new subsection 486C(2)(c) also introduces locus standi provisions for judicial review of migration decisions not falling within part 8 of the act, including decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and matters commenced pursuant to section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903.</para><para>The government action of further restricting judicial review appeals to the High Court follows an earlier restriction of judicial review applications to the Federal Court. The Migration Reform Act 1992 dealt with restrictions on judicial review proceedings in the Federal Court. All this achieved was that prospective litigants took their matters to the High Court instead. As a result, the High Court was subjected to an increase in appeals once the Federal Court doors were closed on them.</para><para>We are witnessing in this House the devolution of executive power to the legislature. It is this legislature which is claiming for itself a power that it does not have, a power to determine the limits of prerogative power and the original jurisdiction of the executive itself. This is nothing new. The legislature has a long history of telling the Crown what to think and what to do. It is the traditional power play between money and votes. However, the result is the same. Those goods which constitute the basis for individual democracy are one and the same powers that rest with the executive—that is, the very purpose of executive power is to oversee the antics of the legislature and the powers bestowed through the legislature to the judicature. That is why this jurisdiction is called judicial review.</para><para>What is judicial review? Judicial review means literally to review the administrative powers itself. It is the executive taking a bird's-eye view of the operation of law and asking the fundamental questions that distinguish democracy from tyranny: is natural justice being served by the logical consequence of the law as it operates in this case; is procedural fairness maintained by the probative and predictable application of law as it presently stands—that is, with indifference to the outcome and hence without bias; is the rule of law being administered in the manner intended by the legislative draftspeople; is the law being applied in a way that has not resulted in an error of law—that is, the administrator has not misconstrued his or her powers when making a decision such as making a choice whether to grant a visa or not to grant a visa; is the decision manifestly unreasonable under the circumstances—that is, would the reasonable decision maker, in the position of the actual decision maker, have made the same decision as that actually made on the facts before him or her?</para><para>It is upon these criteria and many others that the foundations of natural justice are based. This is the law of natural justice, procedural fairness and concepts such as legitimate expectations. It is a fundamental law because it is based upon right reason and not upon the edicts of a statute. Statutes come and go, rights are trammelled by misapplication of utilitarian principles, but the rule of law based on the natural law is paramount because the natural law is based upon right reason. It is this authority that surpasses lower authority such as statutory reason or mere precedent of superior courts. I say this because it is inconsistent with right reason to simply shut the doors on applicants to their redress to natural justice through the prerogative writs. </para><para>Mandamus is an ancient writ which compels a public servant to perform a duty. It asks the question: why did you not perform that duty which you were duty-bound to perform? The mandamus writ therefore compels a lower court or person to perform a task that he or she was duty-bound to perform. Certiorari is a writ from a higher court requesting that records of a case tried in a lower court be referred to a higher court. By comparison, the writ of prohibition from a superior court forbids that a thing be done. These writs are of right. They transcend the immediate interests as espoused by this government. To deny access to these writs is to deny the free flow of natural justice and the system that exists from our cultural legacy. This bill means that a vacuum is created. </para><para>If these writs are not available as of right, then how is natural justice served? The answer is that natural justice is not served. This is a devastating precedent for both immigration law and the broader body of Commonwealth law. It means that capricious, arbitrary and unjust decision making may be permitted by Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs officers who know that ultimately their decisions may never be subject to judicial review except under the vague notion of `exceptional circumstances,' a term with no legal definition and a term to be tried laboriously through the courts in the future. It will be very interesting to see how the courts interpret this law and how the legal profession responds to this new law.</para><para>The alternative is a system based on the natural rights of the applicant and rights in the public interest. This is a trend that is not seen in this bill before us tonight. The opposition opposes schedule 1 of this bill for precisely these reasons. This bill is an affront to the public interest. This bill is an insult to private rights. It is no solution to deny the operation of the public on the one hand because of expedient financial and utilitarian interests of attempting a quick fix of court waiting lists simply because the government will not make the necessary funding to the courts to facilitate an administrative system of its own making. This is an attempt to bury the victims and deny responsibility. If Australia is to remain being known as a country of true justice and freedom it must resist the temptation of being drawn to draft legislation such as this legislation before the House tonight which denies the good operation of natural justice in this way.</para><para>I would now in conclusion like to address the issue of class actions. This is much the same issue but the theme is slightly different. My only concern with class action is that if they are capricious then remedies ought to be found to make the parties accountable if they are indeed found to be acting in some process of `abuse,' as the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> so aptly notes. This may involve expansion of the law of malicious prosecution or some other civil remedy against such persons seeking to extend their stay beyond their reasonable time limit. I conclude with the position consistent with the opposition that, for the reasons I have mentioned, I oppose schedule 1 of this bill. We are establishing a most dangerous precedent which transcends the immediacy of immigration law, a precedent that seeks to consume all law making in Australia.</para><para>It is imperative that we do the following when drafting laws: maintain the position of the executive; restore balance in the balance of powers; maintain the rule of law; maintain the principles of procedural fairness that must be made available to all persons within the jurisdiction of Australia; punish those who would seek to profit from vexatious litigation through punitive measures, rather than seeking to undermine the laws of natural justice; preserve the judicial review jurisdiction of the courts acting as agents for the executive; deny restrictive statutory amendments such as those proposed in the new part 8A of the Migration Act contained in this bill, which seeks to fundamentally undermine the autonomy of the executive by legal fiction that executive power is exclusively the domain of legislative instruments such as acts of parliament, which it is not; and ensure that the Constitution itself is not fundamentally compromised by the application of such powers as those proposed in this bill. For these reasons I have outlined here in the House this evening I oppose schedule 1 and call on this House to review schedule 1 and particularly for the government to come to its senses before this legislation leaves the House and goes to the other chamber. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>23938</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to support the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> and I commend the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for bringing forward this legislation. It adds considerably in improving the way in which we process illegal migrants and asylum seekers in this country. I am on two parliamentary committees that have been looking actively at this whole question of asylum seekers and illegal migrants in this country: the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, headed up by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Chris Gallus—who has provided excellent leadership in this area—and the Joint Standing Committee on Human Rights, which has been looking at detention centres in Port Hedland, Perth, Woomera and Villawood. Having interchange with a lot of the recent arrivals to Australia who are in these detention centres—having seen them first-hand—gives you an appreciation of the problems that have been addressed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and of the difficulties in this area. There is no simple solution. The minister is not trying to claim that there are no problems—there are obviously difficulties associated with this area—but this particular bill is addressing one aspect of this area.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to recognise how quickly most of the migrants and asylum seekers who come to this country are processed. There is a view that it is an interminable process. I commend the minister for the speed with which people are now processed. It is not an easy task, especially when people arrive in the country with no papers. Doing assessments on an individual—what country they come from, their medical condition, their security risk to the country, whether they have had any criminal conviction at all—obviously takes some time. In fact I notice that the minister's press release issued on the 4 February says that since mid-1999 the number of trained staff allocated to process asylum claims has more than doubled. Further, while 80 per cent of protection claims made by boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within 7½ months, this has been reduced to less than 15 weeks for applications made in late 2000. So 80 per cent of all those who arrive illegally in this country are processed within 15 weeks. The human rights committee had discussions with detainees and determined that a whole lot of people had been in these detention centres for 1½ years and others for two and, in some cases, three years. Obviously that is not something we would necessarily support. But, as checks are made and as these people have failed to meet certain criteria, they are kept in longer, especially if there are difficulties in returning them to their country of origin.</para><para>The minister is addressing a significant problem in this country. Firstly, I think it is important to recognise that we in Australia believe in a fair go. A fair go constitutes looking at the migrants coming into this country, and most people do so in terms of the legal process. Migrants accumulate a certain number of points and then they qualify because of the points that are registered. But of course there are those who come as refugees and asylum seekers to this country. I think members of this House would certainly support the whole process of recognition of refugees, given our signature to human rights conventions and the UN charter on these provisions. Each year an allocation of 10,000 people come in under this category. We are showing consideration and concern for people who say they are escaping from oppression in their own country or who believe that in the future they would be oppressed if they stayed in that country and who want to start a new life in Australia. We support and applaud that desire for freedom in a new country. </para><para>If these people are unsuccessful in the first process—in the primary decision—as was said in the minister's press release, 80 per cent are processed in less than 15 weeks in places like Port Hedland and Woomera. A lot of those people are out of there by way of a bridging visa in 10 to 12 weeks. If they fail that primary decision, they go forward to the Refugee Review Tribunal. That can take a varying amount of time. The minister has indicated that, where a case has gone to the RRP, processing time has consistently averaged less than 70 days. I think that is a considerable improvement as well—that is, where you have a group that is independent from the immigration department and from any other source assessing the claim of an individual to be classified as a refugee. So they are reviewed. If they fail that test, quite often moves are made to have them repatriated to their country of origin. </para><para>There are some difficulties in repatriating such people to countries where we do not have formal agreements—where countries do not want to take people who are being involuntarily repatriated—but for the most part the process begins at that point. Of course these people can take action in the High Court on legal aspects of their case or they can simply agree to be repatriated. So what we are dealing with is that category of people who have failed to be classified as refugees—they have failed to convince the independent Refugee Review Tribunal that they are genuine refugees. They have decided to look at other alternatives, and so then look at this question of class action. It is this area of class action which is of concern in this legislation.</para><para>It is not that we do not recognise the claims of genuine refugees in this country. This is directed at those who want to stay on beyond the period of time where they have been given a fair chance to prove their credentials, and who are now looking at various avenues to try to get a claim up. I know that there are various members who are sympathetic to the situation of claimants who find themselves in detention centres. Class action sounds good to people: a group joining together in a claim against the minister. But it is basically just another way of staying longer in the country. As one who was on a recent human rights committee, I see no great benefit in people trying to prolong their stay in the country. But, if they do want to avoid the legal process, class action is one of their ways of doing that. </para><para>To date, 10 migrant class actions have been taken out, involving 9,000 non-residents seeking the right to remain in Australia, despite a determination by DIMA, the MRT, the RRT and, in some cases, the minister as well, that they should leave. So they are looking at this further review process as a means of staying in the country. The track record of these class action cases, however, shows that they have all failed. These people have seen that they have something in common—they have all been refused on the basis of our established criteria for genuine refugees—and they have sued the minister. </para><para>The question here is whether this is the appropriate way to go. I can see other members in this House who would have genuine sympathy for the case of refugees coming to this country. But, if there are problems, let us try to address them in other ways. If there are problems in terms of the length of time or delays, let us put more resources into it. If there are questions of definition of the people coming here and how they can be reviewed, let us look at that. If there are questions about accommodation, let us also review some aspects of the detention program. If we do not support this legislation, what we are saying to illegal migrants or those who have failed the refugee test is that anything is possible, anything goes, as a way of staying in this country. If people had had genuine claims, I believe they would have been found in the first place. Bear in mind—as was stated by the minister in his press release of 4 February—that in 80 per cent of claims the decision is made within 7½ months. After a decision has been made, they then have the opportunity for the RRT. So this is simply another way of prolonging the process. It is enormously costly and it is causing unexpected delays in the whole process. If they are unsuccessful with one class action, some of them—20 per cent of them—simply move to another class action.  </para><para>Some people might say, `You are lacking compassion. You don't understand the problems of these particular cases.' I have got to say that in a lot of the cases there is a genuine need for compassion and understanding of people who are genuinely leaving difficult situations in their own country and are wanting to start a new life. Of course, Australia is made up of many such people—people who have left their own countries and have come here to make this country great. We support that. People can miss out for various reasons. They may be found not to be genuine refugees; they may have made out that they were oppressed in a country where oppression has occurred simply to come in, or they may have actually been involved in some criminal activity in their country. For whatever reason, they have been denied access to this country and this is another way of entry. That is my concern. By all means let us have a genuine debate in this House about the way we address this significant problem of refugees. There is no doubt that this is something confronting us which our parents' generation did not have to confront, which those 20 years ago did not have to confront but which is now a significant issue with boat arrivals being almost a weekly, if not almost a daily, occurrence—where the number of illegal migrants arriving by air continues to increase.</para><para>So how do we address this? If we just simply say, `Look, this is fine. Let's go on. Let's allow class action because this is the natural right of individuals,' we are not coming to grips with the basic problem that we have, which is to establish a program where people have got the right to claim asylum in this country—and that is fair and right. We have established an independent body—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Z</name.id><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Irwin</name></talker><para>—But not to put them into jail—behind barbed wire!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—Well, there are varying views about the way they should be detained, and it might be appropriate to debate that whole question in this House: whether we follow the Swedish model or follow other models. I am sure that this is going to be on the agenda and I have noticed that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline> has taken up the issue as well. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Having been on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I have got to say that the minister has significantly improved the processing of the applications and the way that people are moved through, so the problems the member for Fowler raises may not be as significant as they would otherwise have been. Of course, if people are detained for some years, it is an issue that is worth addressing. But to allow people to go into these class actions, simply using lawyers in this way as another ruse to avoid the legitimate rights of Australians to protect their borders and to decide on what basis they want to let people into the country, is a different matter. We have those who go through the normal process and we have those who have decided for whatever reason to avoid the normal process—and we accept many of them into this country. But this is simply saying that, beyond all that, beyond the normal process—the Refugee Review Tribunal made up of independent people—we do not want to allow this sort of class action.</para><para>Class actions for those people are clearly in conflict with other laws of this country. While class actions can be used in various ways, in this case they are contrary to the Migration Act. Each individual is different and must be assessed in terms of his or her application—including background and professional expertise—and any claim to be a genuine refugee. What is a person's history in terms of oppression in his or her country of origin and what is the likelihood of that person being oppressed in the future? To say that 9,000 people in a class action are all equal is nonsensical in the context of a migration application. There is also the question of where test cases can be run. The department has considered that matter but the lawyers have opposed it because it is simply a way of maximising employers' revenue in this context.</para><para>The abuse of class actions continues under this system and this bill is attempting to end that abuse and the misuse of our legal system. Our laws are exploited and our conventions flouted in order to extend stays in this country. Many unscrupulous practitioners are operating in this area and exploiting people. If people are not to be allowed to remain in this country, they should know why. Their hopes should not be raised falsely. People often think, `Well, there's a chance; all of the lawyers are telling me that this is the way to go.' However, all these actions have been unsuccessful. Is this approach fair and humane? That is another point that we must consider. </para><para>Successive governments—Labor and coalition—have addressed this significant issue, and I know that this minister has considered it seriously. The increasing workload in the Federal Court in migration litigation cost DIMA approximately $11 million in 1998-99 and an estimated cost of more than $20 million in 2001-02. I would like to see that money spent on upgrading facilities in some detention centres. More resources should be devoted to speeding up the review process rather than wasting our funds on the joint action program, which has a low success rate.</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Migration—I see other members of that committee in the chamber—has a harmonious view of life on most occasions. Committee members work together very well and are genuinely interested in and concerned about the welfare and wellbeing of those who wish to come to this country. I think this House should send a message that this is not the appropriate way to proceed. By all means, let us look at aspects of the detention program, but it will not solve our perceived problems. I think the minister is right to bring forward this legislation. It is a significant step forward to eliminate this ruse used by lawyers that does not provide a sensible solution for those seeking genuine refuge in this country. This country stands for freedom and for the welfare of those from overseas who are genuinely oppressed, and we want that to continue. However, those who illegitimately exploit the legal system through joint or class action programs should not be encouraged. That is what this legislation is about. I commend it to the House and I commend the minister for his actions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>23941</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When this government sets about reducing the rights of people, when it sets itself apart from those nations that pride themselves on their human rights and when it attacks the few rights that some people have, we must question this government's motives. We must ask why it is so determined to restrict people's rights. In this case, the government is seeking to restrict access to class actions in the migration jurisdiction in the High Court and the Federal Court. If we ask why the government is seeking to make these changes, it is hard to find a reasonable answer. In this debate, and throughout the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, coalition members have failed to explain why this legislation is needed—or at least why it is in the best interests of Australia. But it is not about the national interest; it is about self-interest: the narrow self-interest of coalition members. </para></talk.start><para>You see, a certain redhead is back in town and all the boys on the coalition benches are trying to catch her eye. They have put on the Old Spice and the Californian Poppy, they have polished the old FJ Holden, they are flexing their anti-migration muscles and now they are trying to outdo each other to show how much like One Nation they can be. We can smell the political hormones—or perhaps it is the Old Spice—in the air. When we speak of the coalition, we can now refer to the grand coalition: the coalition between the Liberal Party and the National Party and, as we can now see in Queensland and in Western Australia, the coalition between the National Party and Pauline Hanson's One Nation. It is a cosy little triangle and this legislation is a result of the policy direction that the coalition, with Pauline Hanson's One Nation, has brought about. Talk about the tail wagging the dog!</para><para>We can imagine just how much further the Liberal and National parties will go to keep their new coalition partner happy. Where are the small `l' Liberals who championed the cause of human rights? Where are those who worked to establish Australia's reputation as a leader in human rights? They are at home studying the opinion polls: they have one eye on the poll data and the other on their wafer-thin margins. They think One Nation preferences will save them, but they will not. </para><para>This legislation is a result of the sort of polling that looks at narrow interests concentrated in individual  seats, legislation which aims to please the most narrow-minded and prejudiced in the electorate, which is not in the best interests of our nation as a whole, and which throws out of the window our hard-earned reputation as a leader in human rights. But this legislation ignores the opinions of the great majority of Australians. We should never lose sight of the fact that we are a nation of immigrants. Many of those arrivals would have experienced immigration officers like the one described in Harry Martin's book <inline font-style="italic">Angels and Arrogant Gods</inline>. He quotes a former immigration officer's view of his colleagues:</para><quote><para>Some of our officers in the early days felt like God and behaved that way.</para></quote><para>It seems that spirit is alive and well in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs today. When you look at DIMA's approach to this bill, it becomes clear that DIMA regards class actions as a nuisance. Court action extends the time taken to determine a case, and it uses up departmental resources. It costs money; it is not efficient. If DIMA looks at its performance in terms of the quantity of its output rather than its quality, it creates an even greater need for judicial review. And a department that is keen to make the cost savings contained in this legislation may also cut corners at other levels. </para><para>In short, the more DIMA looks at its efficiency the greater the need for judicial review. When individuals challenge the might of DIMA, that is a fair fight. But if individuals band together to take on DIMA, that is unfair and an abuse of the system. Never mind the fact that those who have taken part in class actions have little in the way of financial resources. Never mind the fact that they are among the most disadvantaged people to come before the courts. They are just a nuisance. They cost money. They make the bottom line look bad. `Well,' says the minister, `we'll fix them. Let's take away their right to join a class action. We know they cannot fight alone because they do not have the money to take us on. They do not have that sort of money.' The department will save money and will earn some brownie points with the One Nation crowd at the same time. As DIMA stated in its submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration:</para><quote><para>These changes might bring substantial savings to the Commonwealth ... Litigation in class actions was lengthy, complex and therefore expensive ... There would be a reduction in costs currently incurred to establish the migration status details of those who were parties to class actions.</para></quote><para>DIMA added:</para><quote><para>Cost was not a significant motivating factor. </para></quote><para>Despite its protest, what it comes down to is the bottom line. But this view forgets one important thing: we are, after all, dealing with people's lives. The issues involved in this legislation were, as I have mentioned, examined in detail by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, of which I am a member. The legislation was referred to the committee in April of last year and the report was tabled last October. The conclusions and recommendations of the report regarding access to class actions were not approved by all members of the committee and a dissenting report was issued by Labor and Democrat members. The committee received a total of 31 submissions, from organisations and individuals. The great majority of submissions expressed concern about restricting access to class actions. Many submissions raised the issue of human rights and Australia's international obligations, making a strong case for opposing the restrictions. The committee therefore spent considerable time on this part of its inquiry. The points made in the submission stress Australia's international obligations; as these are summarised in the report, I will briefly run through them. The International Commission of Jurists referred to article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides: </para><quote><para>Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ...</para></quote><para>The commission further referred to paragraph 27 of the Vienna declaration as a recent statement of the principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which says:</para><quote><para>Every state should provide an effective framework of remedies to redress human rights grievances or violations. </para></quote><para>The Law Council of Australia argued that Australia, to avoid breaching its international obligations, must have an effective procedure to determine the validity of an asylum seeker's claim. Whether these requirements were met by the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Immigration Review Tribunal was questioned by a number of submissions which drew the committee's attention to article 14 of the ICCPR. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission claimed the tribunals did not satisfy the requirements of article 14, which, it said, requires `a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent, impartial tribunal'. The Law Council of Australia and Amnesty International also referred to article 14, saying that it provides that `all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals'. This point was also taken up by the National Council of Churches in Australia, whose view was that the bill would seek `to treat asylum seekers in a manner different to all other persons, in contravention of article 14'.</para><para>In its examination of the bill, the Refugee Council of Australia implied that the bill went against the obligation set out in the ICCPR, articles 2, 14 and 26, `to give non-citizens access to the courts on the same terms as nationals'. The question of whether the bill contravenes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights turns on how you see Australia's obligations under the ICCPR. The government seems to think it is sufficient to have `full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal'. But is the obligation a broader one which extends to giving non-citizens access to the courts on the same terms as nationals? </para><para>The difference here is not just a matter of splitting legal hairs. It is not a matter for legal interpretation at all. It is a question for this parliament to decide—whether we should interpret our international obligations in a narrow sense or in a broader fashion. In preparing a dissenting report, Labor and Democrat members have taken the broader definition of our international obligations. This is the real point of difference between the coalition and Labor, between a coalition government seeking to shirk our international obligations and Labor, which sees Australia as a leading advocate of human rights. If the cost of that leadership is to inconvenience DIMA, it is a very, very small price to pay.</para><para>What was the DIMA response? They accepted that article 14 indicates that judicial review should be available but advised that according to the Attorney-General's Department the bill's provisions relating to class actions did not break any conventions. Here again is the point of difference. Do we want to set an example as a responsible nation, a leader in human rights, or merely do the minimum required of us? Do we look for legal loopholes to avoid our obligations? The difference between Labor and the government on this is very clear. One would expect that the changes contained in this bill were warranted so as to prevent serious abuse of the system. Yet DIMA were not able to convince the Labor and Democrat members of the committee that this was the case. As the dissenting report states, while there was a potential for exploitation, DIMA did not prove that there was such widespread abuse as to require the legislative action proposed in the bill. This is a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The alternative proposed by DIMA to replace access to class actions included the increased use of test cases. As these would be in a sense sponsored by DIMA, they would hardly be seen as independent and impartial as required under article 14 of the ICCPR.</para><para>But the issues here go beyond the question of the cost and inconvenience to the department and in a way they go beyond the principles of human rights obligations. In the end, each case that is considered is a real person. Always remember that: each case is a real person. When preparing this speech, I looked through the immigration files in my electorate office to see the circumstances of people involved in class action cases. I will not mention their names, but these are the sorts of issues that come before the courts in these cases. I think some of these stories have got to be told. These do come before the courts. These are real people. We have always got to remember that: these are real people. They deserve the same rights as all Australian citizens. The first case involves an applicant for permanent resident status who claims that his application was not properly processed when it was lodged with the department. While the department has denied that it received the application, independent sources have suggested that there were problems—and there were problems—at the office where the application was lodged at the time that the claimed lodgment was made. What would an Australian citizen do in such circumstances? Surely they would expect to be able to take the matter as far as possible. But, under this bill that we are debating in the House tonight, we would deny similar rights to a non-citizen. The second case is one which concerns me greatly, and this is indeed a genuine case; a woman I have the privilege to know. A woman who has been an outspoken campaigner against female genital mutilation in her homeland was denied a protection visa. She holds grave fears for the safety of her daughter and herself if she is forced to return. Faced with such prospects, would not any Australian citizen use all legal avenues available to protect their daughter? I have a beautiful daughter and I would protect her in any way possible. But, contrary to article 14 of the ICCPR, she would be denied that right. </para><para>These are real people. How our system deals with them should be the same as it would apply to us. We should not have one rule for us and another for the rest. You can take the Hansonite approach, which the Liberal and National parties seem to be taking in Queensland and Western Australia, and deny access to class actions. You may even attempt to justify this by narrowly defining Australia's international obligations. But, in the end, we as a nation will be judged not just by how we treat our own citizens but by how we treat others as well. Those parts of the bill dealing with section 486B of the Migration Act must be opposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>23944</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to speak on this <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>, as I welcome the opportunity to highlight the very real concerns that some members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration have with the proposals being put forward by the government today. Like so much of the migration related legislation that is discussed and debated in this chamber, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 reinforces the tireless attitude of this government of punishing immigrants by disenfranchising them from the Australian justice system.</para></talk.start><para>I have spoken numerous times on the hardship and humiliation people undergo throughout the Australian migration process. It does not matter what category of entry to Australia a person may choose to apply under, he or she will be subjected to a migration process of relentless suspicion and speculation. Their personal relationships will be questioned, their morality will be examined and their integrity will be undermined. Migration to Australia is pretty much considered a criminal offence by this government, and the amendment bill we are debating tonight further entrenches in our justice system the notion that migrants and refugees are not entitled to Australia's fundamental judicial practice of innocent until proven guilty.</para><para>There are two elements of this bill that I find quite alarming. The first relates to the methodology used by the government to examine the utility of class and/or representative actions being used in the system of judicial review. The second concern I have is the implication that the changes to the review jurisdiction of the Federal and Supreme Courts are unconstitutional. Many other things have been said about this bill, but I might just focus on these two particular points. The opposition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration tabled a dissenting report on the inquiry into the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>. The dissenting report primarily discussed the inquiry's considerations to restrict access of class actions for judicial review of migration decisions by the Federal Court and the High Court. As is indicated in our report, the inquiry failed to conclude that the use of class and/or representative actions was being abused and being used to simply delay a person's departure from Australia. The inquiry simply did not receive compelling arguments that the abuse of class actions exists at all. The government members of the committee were also forced to accept that the evidence provided to the inquiry was not sufficient to pinpoint class actions as a particular problem.  </para><para>The government members concluded that class actions were not an abuse of the system, that the process could be abused and that the level of abuse was not quantified. Yet the government did not provided a sufficient alternative to allay their fears of class action abuse. The key rationale for the class action provisions of this bill could not be and is not sustained. There was no firm evidence of any kind of the claimed abuse of this process, which is the rationale for restricting the access in the first place. But there was no indication that alternatives to the proposed legislative solution had even been considered by the government at all. So the government has a perception that class actions can be abused, and the only solution offered is the removal of the judicial review process. Like so many of the migration decisions made by this government, the outcome is to punish the many in order to catch the few.</para><para>The inquiry also considered submissions and testimony from numerous interest groups which indicated that the courts already have mechanisms for filtering and dismissing frivolous or illegitimate applications. Contrary to the government's reasoning, the National Council of Churches of Australia, the NCCA, argued that the failure of a class action case could not be taken as proof of abuse. The Law Council of Australia commented further that the courts have not described any of the unsuccessful class actions as abusive action or behaviour. </para><para>The inquiry heard further evidence that the success rate of class action reviews in the High Court could be remedied if the government showed a commitment to real solutions to migration problems. The government proposal to restrict access to class actions is aimed squarely at the applicants, that is, the ones most likely to be seeking redress through the courts. I do not consider the restriction of class action as an appropriate solution to the alleged abuses. The NCCA pointed out that the lack of merit in some actions may reflect an abuse of legal advice rather than a decision to exploit the review process itself. Alternative remedies to this were discussed at the public hearings conducted by the committee, with an understanding that better access to lawyers and ethical migration agents would enable applicants for judicial review to obtain professional advice to clients on the avenues of appeal and the prospects of their particular case. It was evident to the committee that individual migration agents were well placed to use the class action appeal process to their professional advantage. The Migration Agents Registration Authority, MARA, had failed to address DIMA concerns of this practice being undertaken. The dissenting report concluded:</para><quote><para>The performance of MARA, the body that is responsible for monitoring the conduct of registered agents, should be of grave concern to the Government and the migration advice industry in general.</para></quote><para>It was clear to the opposition members, and I am sure also to the government members, of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration that alternative action was a viable solution to the government's claims of class action abuse. It was also evident to the opposition members of the committee that the government had not intended to remedy the real problems with the judicial review process in the first instance. Rather, the government has clung to a notion of class action abuse, regardless of an overwhelming lack of evidence, and intends to punish the innocent based on this false premise. </para><para>I have already touched on the notion that migration applicants are subject to an assessment and judicial process unknown to others in Australia. It would appear that the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> will now institutionalise the inequity of Australian migration regardless of the impact on the Federal and High Courts and potential illegality of judicial review process. An element of the government's explanation for the restriction of class action on migration review decisions has focused on the cost and time class actions take in the court system itself. Despite the government's desire to eliminate review applications in the courts by making the process financially harder on an individual, there is significant potential that restriction of access to class actions would have a negative impact on the court system. Individuals will now be required to commence separate proceedings, which will increase the workload of the courts. Some of those proceedings may also serve as test cases. The success of one proceeding may encourage others of a similar nature. Again, this would mean a greater volume of litigation for the court system, and the justices of the High Court have made very clear their opposition to this prospect.</para><para>So what is the government's solution to the potential of litigation increasing? Restrict the rights of the applicant even further. Yes, deny the applicant the opportunity of full and equal judicial review. What an innovative idea from a government against immigration! So, rather than allowing an individual the opportunity to access the full judicial review process of Australia, this bill will introduce a time limit on the making of applications to the High Court for review of migration decisions. The time limits, 28 days from decision, are to be absolute and not able to be varied by the court.</para><para>There seems to be a problem with this restriction. There appears to be a debate on whether an absolute time limit for appeal to the High Court is constitutional. This brings me to the second point which I feel has a great impact on this bill. The question which arises is whether the imposition of absolute time limits on applications to the High Court for judicial review impermissibly interfere with the exercise of federal judicial power. As suggested in the research on this specific threat to the separation of powers in Australia's political executive, I am going to leave that debate to the constitutional lawyers. I want specifically to touch on the point that what we have today is a government which is prepared to introduce legislation that could—I stress `could'—undermine the Australian Constitution and tie up the High Court and the Federal Court in further litigation, all because approximately 3,500 people have sought class action judicial review. You might think that 3,500 is a lot of people; it is, but over 10 years it is a reasonable figure.</para><para>The astounding part of this debate is that the government has failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of these amendments, it has not considered any viable alternatives to allay its fears of class action abuse and, finally, it has refused to address substantial problems in its own migration process and how these problems are monitored. In light of any evidence of practical gain from these legislative changes, I would recommend that the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for further consideration. I would reserve my right to move, amend or oppose relevant parts of the bill following the committee's report.</para><para>Finally, I touch on a couple of issues which are relevant to this debate and poignant. This government is spending disproportionate amounts of taxpayers' money in what it is beating up to be a bigger problem than actually exists. It is spending millions of dollars in places like Woomera, out in the middle of nowhere. If you stand on a building at Woomera and turn 360 degrees, you will not see a tree. If you turn 360 degrees again, you will not see another building. If you keep looking on the horizon for any landmark, you will see that there really are not any. If someone were to leave this detention centre, there would be nowhere to go, as has been seen. That is the reality. Yet to ensure that people are not going to escape from these centres, we build more security, higher walls and bigger fences when they are not needed. It reinforces the mentality and attitude in these centres that these people are not going through a traditional process of migration to Australia and are more than just detainees. They are being made out to be criminals. In effect, after very lengthy periods of waiting—up to two years and I have heard of some which are longer—detainees lose patience with what would be reasonable attitudes towards the government and not knowing. It is more the fact that they are there sometimes for up to 12 or 24 months and do not know what is happening to them. Either they do not have language skills or they do not have any support. They are kept in what are inhospitable conditions. Being on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I have visited these places. Our report was entitled `Not the Hilton'. I assure you that Woomera is not the Hilton. </para><para>We are seeing disproportionate amounts of money being spent on a problem which does not exist in the first place. But if you repeat the lie enough and seem to be doing something about something which is not happening in the first place, then people say, `Look, they're doing something about a problem.' But, of course, the problem never existed to start with. The problem manifested itself out of nothing. That concerns me. Regardless of how you classify people, whether they are immigrants through the traditional process of migration, refugees, asylum seekers or others, then sometimes there are no other choices but to come to this country to seek asylum through other than normal channels. The government must be understanding of that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Z</name.id><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Irwin</name></talker><para>—They don't have the heart.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name></talker><para>—That is right; they do not have the heart. Government members in this debate have used emotional tactics. Why would these people come to this country and destroy their papers, their identification? They say that it is to prolong the process here of trying to identify who they are. Why would you do that? Sooner or later you are identified and, if your claims are not bona fide, then you are deported. What would be the bonus of sitting for 12 months or two years in a detention centre, for example in Woomera in the middle of the desert, when eventually you have to go back? The conditions there are probably harsher than where they have come from.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I have said in previous debates, I think the hardship which some people go through to leave the persecution and potential death which they face in their own country is sometimes exacerbated by the conditions and the criminality which we impose on these people when they come to our shores. The government has made it very clear from the outset with pamphlets and brochures trying to scare off people. You do not scare off people with lies and with, `If you land on our shore, you are going to be eaten by a crocodile or a shark or you are going to be killed by someone.' These are lies. This is a fraudulent reflection on the Australian nation. This is not what our country is about. This is not who we are as Australians. This is not the identity we built up. We do not do that. Yet it was attempted. It was only through great pressure brought by ordinary Australians here in Australia that we saw the government and the minister take a second look and say, `Hang on, we might be on the wrong track here. We've missed the boat on this politically.'</para><para>This is a political issue. This is not really about the migrants, the refugees, the asylum seekers. This is a difficult subject for all governments of any persuasion. It is always difficult to manage migration, but you can do it effectively and responsibly. We are seeing this government not being responsible. It is saying, `If you come here, you will be eaten by a crocodile.' That is not responsible. `If you come here, we will stick you in a detention centre indefinitely and we will not tell you what is happening to you. We will break all of the laws of natural justice. We will break all of the laws of what happens in this country to every other person, regardless of whether or not they are a citizen. We will do that and we will do it irresponsibly.' That is what they are doing. Immigration should not be a political topic. It should be about dealing with these issues. If people come here who are not bona fide, then they will have to leave. On both sides, I think we agree with that. I am talking about the process here, the process which this government says will make things better. </para><para>When DIMA was before us at the public hearings, we asked the supposed experts, the heads of department, some very simple questions—you can check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for this. I asked, `Will this save the government money?' `Óh, yes, Minister, of course it will, lots of money.' `How much money?' `Just lots.' I said, `Really. That is funny; that is not what the minister says. The minister says that this could cost the Commonwealth money.' They say, “Oh, well, then it might cost money.' So I am saying, `Which one is it? Will it save a lot of money—buckets, big loads—or will it cost us potentially some money?' `We'll get back to you on that.' That was one premise: we have to have this because we have to save money. So that is that one out the door. `Is it constitutional?' `We have advice which says it is.' `Can we have a look at this advice?' `Sure, eventually.' So we get the advice. I can read legalese just a bit. I clearly read that it says you could deduce that it might be constitutional if it were not unconstitutional, if you know what I mean.</para><para>The advice basically says, `Look, call it whatever you like, but don't come back to us and blame us and say that we told you it was constitutional because what we are saying is that we are not giving you an opinion.' So it was very good legal advice. When I looked at all of the reasons the government demanded to have these changes, I could not find one bona fide reason based in fact. I could find plenty of reasons based on innuendo and speculation—a whole range of irresponsible reasons—but not one real reason based in fact. If the committee charged with reviewing these bits of legislation had been shown any skerrick of evidence or fact we would have accepted it. We did not accept it because the evidence pointed the other way. It said, `There is no abuse that we can point to in fact.' What we saw was the government saying, `Those facts are not the facts; these are the facts on which we will be basing our decision.' </para><para>The opposition members were left to ponder what we were to do so we wrote a dissenting report. It was the only option we, and the Democrats, had. We do not want to frustrate the process; we simply want the facts to come forward. Who would not want the facts to come forward? But when you have a committee that absolutely refuses to accept the hard cold facts from everyone who comes before it in evidence, what are you to do? You have to write a dissenting report—not to frustrate the system, as I said, but merely to present the facts as they stand, unaltered. </para><para>This bill will not make any changes that will benefit the public, the government, the taxpayer or, more importantly, anyone who is currently sitting in a detention centre. It will not make any difference. If the government were serious about addressing this problem—because there is a problem out of there—it would tackle the problems where they exist. Let us look at migration agents, at their ethics and at how they operate. Let us look at how advertising takes place in the industry. It does not just encourage people to take class-actions, it almost guarantees them a win. Let us look at a whole range of things but let us not point all of the blame to those people who take part in a class action, which they are so entitled to choose, because they are seeking redress. They are seeking the full availability of the law as any other person in their right mind would do. Why wouldn't you? If you have come here and you are bona fide, and you believe you are bona fide, why wouldn't you take any option available to you? Why shouldn't Australia and the government allow that to take place, unless there are other motives, and I am yet to find out what those other motives are? </para><para>Finally, I think this bill is absolutely wrong. It is incorrect, it is misguided, it is irresponsible and it will cost the taxpayer more money rather than less and, in the end, it will make no difference. It will increase the workload of the courts. It will make the work of the courts harder and it will threaten the Constitution. I think these are serious issues, serious concerns, and the government should just take another look. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>23949</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the useful point to start is to join with the member for Oxley in conceding at the start that the area of immigration, and particularly that relating to refugees, is not unproblematic. It is certainly true that amongst those many deserving people who come to this country there are some who misuse and abuse the system. That said, it is no different from any other walk of life, from any other circumstance, from any other citizen or any other noncitizen. But there is no other area of our legal administration where we assume the infallibility of bureaucrats. </para></talk.start><para>There is no reason why we should as a nation, which is not beset with evidence that these systems are being abused to a degree which would warrant this legislation, pursue a course which really is only being pursued in this instance, I believe, because of political considerations. The member for Fowler, who made a very strong and useful contribution regarding the work that has been done by the parliamentary committee, and the very incisive minority report which went through the evidence that was presented made that point very clearly.</para><para>I think it is useful firstly, though, to avoid some of the pejorative language that has been used in this House. It is not right to find ourselves gathering in the parliament of Australia and describing people who come to this country and seek refuge here as all—and I use the words that have been used—criminal aliens. This is not language appropriate to such people. Some, of course, will be seeking to abuse the system, some will be lying, some will be creating false stories and fictions in order that they can make their claims but others will be deserving; others will require protection. </para><para>It is certainly not the case that those who assess matters relating to these claims always get it right. If it were the case that they always got it right, we would not have a review process in place. This parliament would not have established it. We would have simply left it to the first decision of an assessing official of the department of immigration. To be fair to those officers, I believe they do their best. But they are under great pressure and I suspect that, in many instances, they err towards scepticism, knowing that there are other review options available. Then, a person who is refused has the opportunity of having their matter assessed by the Immigration Review Tribunal processes. Again, those involved in those processes do their best, and I have many good friends and associations with people who are doing a very good job in Australia's interests to sift out those who are deserving applicants, not only in the refugee stream but in the general stream, and to make correct and proper decisions. But nor do they always get it right.</para><para>The suggestion that we should exclude from our minds the possibility that errors at that stage cannot be reached is wrong. There are a number of instances where the Federal Court and other courts—the High Court of Australia—have upheld appeals. It is important first to nail the perception that no successful cases have been brought against those determinations. The report of the parliament assessing these matters drew our attention to two successful matters where class actions were undertaken which resulted in an overturning of the prior decision—the decisions in Fazal Din and Lay Kon Tji.</para><para>But whether or not we have a perfect system—and no-one would ever assess that we are capable of creating a perfect system—and whether or not it is wrong for anyone in this House to pursue a course which demonises all those people who come here seeking our protection or seeking to reside in this country, this country has been built on diversity. It has been built on the willingness of millions of people from all walks of life and from many different countries to put aside their first commitments to other countries to make a new life in this one. I find the idea of `baby criminal aliens', `infant criminal aliens' and `nursing mother criminal aliens' quite offensive. It reminds me of the kind of narrow, dog-whistling populist politics that sometimes comes up in the lead-up to elections, where we are hearing the kinds of appeals that the member for Fowler so correctly identified as associated more with trying to ingratiate oneself with those who support the odious views of Pauline Hanson. I do not believe the minister is seeking to associate himself with the odious views of Pauline Hanson, but, unfortunately, the wraithlike spirits from some of the back benches, who came down to support his legislation, did use language which I think could properly be characterised in that way. </para><para>Grammar is a very important thing. I believe that we need a system which is just, quick and cheap. But if you leave the comma out, you have a very different outcome. What we will get with the minister is a system which is just quick and cheap. It will not be just, quick and cheap; it will be just quick and cheap. We will be the losers. Certainly there will be many people who would otherwise have had the opportunity to have their cases heard and determined according to law who will find themselves disadvantaged. But, ultimately, if we withdraw the opportunity for judicial review from those who would seek it, it falls back on us. Once you admit these large exceptions to the general rule—that no bureaucrat is infallible—where do you stop? Why not exclude the possibility of judicial review in a whole range of other areas which might be awkward, embarrassing or difficult to a government.</para><para>Most of the debate so far in this House has focussed on the issue of grouped actions or class actions. I do not really wish to repeat all of the ground, because I think it is covered very compendiously and very well in the minority report which sets out reasons why the department failed to establish even a prima facie case for this legislation. Those matters have also been well canvassed in this House by the member for Fowler and the member for Oxley. So, I will cast aside much of my compendious preparation for this debate. Instead, I will talk about the other aspect of this legislation, which is the attempt to narrow the time frame, whereby decisions can be appealed to the High Court of Australia, to 28 days. It has not had much focus but it is a very serious matter, because what is being attempted is to place a bar between the original jurisdiction of the High Court and the opportunity of those who may have a legal right to seek access to that court and who seek to do so.</para><para>Why does this matter so much? Why are we concerned about the High Court? The reason we are concerned about access to the High Court is that the minister, through a number of other pieces of legislation, is also seeking to curtail all rights of legal review through the Federal Court, not just through grouped actions or class actions, as in this instance, but more generally. The minister is aware, through his legal advice, that he cannot remove appeal to the High Court of Australia for constitutional reasons. The Constitution provides an original jurisdiction in the High Court of Australia which cannot be removed by legislation. So the minister is seeking to say, `You must exercise that right within 28 days.' The problem with that is that it does not distinguish between the meritorious and the unmeritorious. In fact, it is most likely to be the unmeritorious who go to the so-called shonky legal advisers—the people who are fast and loose—who get through that gate. Then where do they go once they get past the gate? We have heard much about this automatic issue of visas—that you get it automatically. That is not the court's fault; it is the minister's decision. The minister need not follow that course. I understand there are perfectly good reasons why the minister may, as a general procedure, grant a visa to cover those periods, because, were he not to do so, in some instances the court would so order. But not always, and certainly not in unmeritorious matters. But the minister has pursued a policy of granting blanket visas. It is not this parliament. Nothing is being addressed by this legislation. It is the minister.</para><para>What will happen when a matter gets before the High Court in its original jurisdiction? The truth is that the High Court is composed of seven justices. It is already massively overburdened in terms of its workload by matters that arise under its original jurisdiction. It cannot now remit most of those matters back to the Federal Court, because it has been told that it is not allowed to do so. </para><para>So we find the absurd situation where justices of the High Court are sitting determining primary facts, wasting their time and ours, undertaking a task which should not ever be undertaken at that level. The truth is that the High Court will sometimes have to undertake those tasks in priority over other responsibilities it has as our first and highest constitutional court. But, in the main, it will simply allow those matters to backlog. So, in practice, this will create an unreviewable, open entry visa, indefinite in its nature because the High Court simply does not have the means, capacity or resources to hear and determine, according to law, those issues that come before it. We are building up a huge long-term deluge of problems far greater than those which are sought to be addressed. Add to it the fact now that, were this legislation about grouped actions to pass, we would not be able to have the case of a number of people joining together to have an issue which concerns a number of different people—under a similar visa class or arising from the same issue—heard and determined at the same time. No, those lawyers who presently advertise and tout for work will do the same but they will have to initiate original proceedings individually before the High Court of Australia, and they will have to do it at a very early stage without the opportunity of proper advice or proper assessment. They will know they will have plenty of time to do that afterwards, because the court will not possibly hear and determine the matters for years. So you get your matter in and guarantee—as I think the language was—your `illegal criminal alien' an indefinite free pass to Australia. This is an absurd outcome. It is where the remedy is worse than the evil.</para><para>We are positioning ourselves as a parliament of absurdity, and the minister, I am afraid, is fully aware of the conundrum in which he is placing us. There is no excuse in this instance to say that these consequences have been unforeseen. The High Court of Australia itself has drawn the minister's attention to them in very forceful terms. Mr Justice McHugh, in a case Re the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ex parte Durairajasingham, decided by the High Court last year, said that:</para><quote><para>... the effect of restricting the jurisdiction of the Federal Court to hear applications by persons claiming refugee status will often be to produce two hearings instead of one ... to lengthen the time taken to dispose of those applications and to use the time of the Federal judiciary inefficiently.</para></quote><para>He makes much more savage criticisms than that. Other judges have made similar remarks. Were these restrictions on grouped actions to take place, I think the circumstance would be tenfold enhanced in terms of its consequence. What it will certainly mean is that anyone who is a smarty will move straight to that queue and get the free pass for years. It will mean that some people will lose their place. There will be more people deported without the opportunity of judicial review. That will certainly happen, but those who get in the queue will get the free pass and there will be no distinction between those who go there because of merit and those who go there because they are seeking to abuse the system. We actually need responses that go to the merits.</para><para>There are a couple of other things that the minister could have done which he did not do. This is because of a mindset that is going towards closing down every opportunity for independent, external, impartial judicial review. But what about the areas in the minister's own control? What about, for example, the area of the control of the licensing and regulation of migration agents? We have heard a number of instances where it is asserted that unethical and unprofessional conduct has been taking place on the part of those who are licensed in that regard. What steps have been taken against them? The evidence before the committee suggests that the licensing authority was not even made aware by the minister of those concerns; it did not know of those matters. So the answer is the minister was asleep at his wheel. </para><para>Certainly, nobody made a complaint to the licensing board; no action was attempted in relation to unethical practice. What complaints have been made to law societies? The minister may respond—and I have seen a legal opinion which has been prepared at his instance and signed by a former high official of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Dale Boucher, now a partner of Minter Ellison—that there may be some limits in terms of the federal parliament's capacity to license and administer the conduct of lawyers as practitioners in this field. That avoids two points. Firstly, it avoids the point that, in order to practise in the migration area, one must be a licensed migration agent, and there is no doubt of the reach of this parliament's power to license, control and regulate migration agents. The second point it ignores is the paragraph in Minter Ellison's advice that the reach of this parliament's power could go further than the minister would have us believe. As paragraph 17 of the advice says:</para><quote><para>This is not to say that some further form of regulation of barristers, solicitors or migration agents may not be advised or contemplated: but it is to say that any proposal needs to be most carefully framed and, we believe, continuously and carefully considered.</para></quote><para>So it should be. But, instead of those carefully considered and carefully framed proposals that actually go to the evil that has been described by the minister, we have this blunderbuss scattergun approach which does not go to any solution that will actually have an impact on the problem that the minister is seeking to eradicate. In fact, it will consolidate that problem. If I were a lawyer who was unscrupulous, I would be advertising like mad. I would be advertising free passes—long-term passes—because you would know that the queue before the High Court was going to be so slow that you could essentially guarantee a person permanent residence in this country.</para><para>I do not believe that that is a consequence the minister would wish, but I believe that it is a consequence that will follow quite logically from the way in which this legislation has been constructed and from the fact that the Constitution prohibits the High Court of Australia from refusing its jurisdiction in these areas. But, through the acts of this minister and this parliament, the opportunity for the court to refer the matters to other courts which could deal with the matters—the Federal Court of Australia and the new Magistrates Court—has been excluded. So we have essentially created a Gordian knot, and it needs to be cut. This legislation is not a solution; this is simply adding one more knot to an already knotty problem. It does not cut the Gordian knot. It simply gives those who want to abuse the system a further opportunity whilst encouraging those wraiths of Hanson, the pale ghosts that we sometimes see in this House. I do not accuse the minister, in any regard, of this; I think that the minister is simply wrong in the measures that he proposes. I think he may be somewhat hopeful that if he is seen to be doing something that in itself is its own reward. But he has not pursued avenues which are more directly open to him. The measures that he is seeking to persuade us to undertake are ones which will be counter-productive. I regret very much the tone of some of the contributions in this debate. The tone of these contributions goes far beyond that which is appropriate or warranted in their description of fellow human beings who are seeking the courtesy of residence in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>23952</page.no><name role="metadata">Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr THEOPHANOUS</name><name.id>QJ4</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have before us a very serious bill, the <inline ref="R1026">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>, which raises a very large number of issues: humanitarian, legal and constitutional. I think the debate on this bill that we have had so far, especially in regard to the contributions of the opposition members, has been a very good one. It has raised a number of issues, and I am surprised that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is still persisting with his proposals despite the fact that it is clear that the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents are all going to oppose this legislation in the Senate and that it is not going to proceed. It also raises questions about what the intention is of putting this legislation forward under those circumstances.  </para></talk.start><para>The contributions of the government members seemed to me to be lacking in arguments because they appeared to fail to understand the complexities of the immigration system. For example, the member for Dawson spent nearly half of her contribution talking about the individual case of a criminal alien which had nothing to do with the legislation before us. It had nothing to do with it, but it was pretty good emotional stuff to try to arouse people about the need for such legislation. I think we need to be very careful in immigration matters to differentiate between those cases that are relevant and those cases that are not relevant when we are dealing with an issue. The member for Moreton also talked to a great extent about the recent arrivals of `boat people' and the `queue jumpers' and used other similar terms. I agree with the shadow minister about the need for us to be careful with our language. Leaving that aside, under the new regulations these people are only entitled to a TPV visa—the three-year temporary protection visa. Of course, one of the facts that the government keeps from the community when it goes out abusing these people is that more than 90 per cent of them pass through Australia's very tough determination system when the determination is finally made—more than 90 per cent. But, after that, they are not granted permanent residence; they are granted this three-year temporary visa, and, I might say, the minister has not indicated what is going to happen to these people after three years. </para><para>Having said that, let us go to the relevant issues before us in relation to this bill. Let us go directly to a quote from the minister himself as to whether the problems that he identifies are going to be solved by these particular provisions. I read from his second reading speech:</para><quote><para>As I indicated earlier, while access to bridging visas acts as a pull factor, encouraging persons to take part in court actions merely to prolong their stay in Australia, denying access to bridging visas to litigants is not the Commonwealth's preferred option. Many such persons would, I believe, still take court action even if access to bridging visas were denied. </para></quote><para>That is a very important point. The minister made this point in his own statement, and yet he failed to take into account the evidence before the parliamentary committee on this issue. I will come back to this. Let us look at the minister's own reasoning on this. One consequence of the minister's reasoning is that there is going to be a dramatic increase in individual cases. The minister said that about 4,000 people have gone through in these combined cases. Let us imagine that one quarter of the people who went in for these class actions decided to go for an individual action before the High Court. Instead of having 10 cases before the High Court, we would have a thousand cases. Imagine! Justice McHugh has spoken on this issue. If we restrict access to the Federal Court and if we take other actions of this kind, what is going to happen? Let me read a quote from him:</para><quote><para>The effect of restricting the jurisdiction of the Federal Court must inevitably impose on the Justices of this Court—</para></quote><para>he is referring to the High Court—</para><quote><para>the dilemma of choosing between two unpalatable alternatives. The first alternative is to give preference to the applications of persons held in custody and claiming refugee status to the detriment of the Court's general constitutional and appellate jurisdiction. The second alternative is to continue to give preference to the constitutional and appellate jurisdiction of the Court with the result that claimants for refugee status are detained in custody for longer periods than is likely to have been the case if the Federal Court had retained all of its jurisdiction to deal with refugee cases.</para></quote><para>I think that Justice McHugh's view would be shared by most justices of the High Court, and indeed even of the Federal Court. But that does not seem to have affected the government. What we have got to do now is ask ourselves what really is the net loss from continuing to allow the Australian tradition of natural justice to apply in relation to class actions. After all, class actions were brought in with the unanimous endorsement of this parliament in recognition of the fact that most people who go in for class actions cannot afford individually to go to the High Court. Many of these people are very poor. Many of the people we are talking about are held in detention centres. </para><para>Let me just go to another furphy here. It is very interesting. The minister says that they use this as a way of prolonging their stay in Australia. But who are we talking about when we talk about `they'? We are talking about two groups of people. We are talking about people who are held in detention centres and will continue to be held in detention centres while this High Court determination processes takes place. I ask you: if it is going to take two years before your class action comes up and you are going to have the generosity of two more years in the detention centre, is this the reason why you are making an application? What is the answer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to that? And the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, as was mentioned many times, found no evidence that these people were trying to abuse the system. Why would a person who is facing two more years in a detention centre be trying to abuse the system? What is the net benefit for that person and his family?</para><para>You might say, `Okay, that is one group; what about the other group, the people who are already in the community but who have been rejected for refugee status and want to stay in Australia for an extra period of time, according to the minister, by making such an application?' First of all, if these people are not in detention that means the minister does not consider them to be a threat, because everyone who he considers to be a threat or who he considers to have the potentiality of absconding or of committing criminal offences is already in detention. Therefore, these people are considered relatively safe for the community. We are saying that we are going to take away these people's rights to natural justice simply to prevent them from staying another year or two in Australia—without any rights, I might say—when there are no reasons to believe that they are going to commit any criminal offence or abscond.</para><para>But, you see, when analysis takes place in immigration matters, when we really get to the nitty-gritty of the issues, different outcomes come out, as the member for Denison has shown very strongly, in relation to the legal questions. It is very interesting. We have had the government today continuously accuse the opposition of being lazy on policy issues. I can tell you this: this is a lazy policy, because it does not work, it does not deal with the issues, it does not deal with the problems.</para><para>Let us look at the three reasons the minister gives in his speech. Firstly, it appears that the government is primarily worried about the increased cost, projected at $20 million in 2001-02, of the increased litigation. This is rich coming from a minister who is prepared to spend $150 million on detention centres and the detention of people. His solution to the crisis, as he sees it, of a few extra people coming to Australia on boats, et cetera, is to build more detention centres, when we have a situation where, as I have already mentioned, more than 90 per cent are being approved by the tribunal as genuine refugees.</para><para>If the minister is interested in really saving money in this area why doesn't he look at the alternatives to detention? We are told that he is going to look at the Swedish model. I do not think he is looking at the Swedish model, because he went to Sweden and made all sorts of comments that appeared to be prejudging the issue. Anyway, I will be interested to see whether the minister is going to look at the Swedish model, for humanitarian reasons. So let us put that furphy aside about the cost issue. And remember this about the cost issue: as the member for Denison and others have said, if even a proportion of these people are forced to go in individual cases the cost will blow out enormously. If the minister thinks $20 million in these sorts of cases is a lot, what is it going to be if there are 500 or 1,000 people in individual cases? What is going to be the cost then? What an absurdity!</para><para>I have already addressed the issue about the so-called abuses in the class actions. I will come back to this issue, because there may be certain instances where there are abuses. But the minister's proposals do not deal with the abuses. The minister's proposals are like putting everybody in detention because there might be five per cent of people who we consider might abscond or who might not be genuine refugees—as if that is a sensible or just solution to a problem—or, as in this case, punishing everybody because some people may be guilty of abuses, instead of trying to target ways and means of overcoming the abuses. The minority report of the parliamentary committee from the Democrats and the Labor Party dealt with this issue and said: let us have a look at possible positive ways of dealing with abuses, if they exist, rather than trying to make a huge mountain of this matter when there is insufficient evidence and then trying to deal with it by taking away natural rights from people. </para><para>The other argument presented by the minister is an interesting one. He says that the government believes judicial review is less necessary `in light of the extensive merits review rights enshrined in the migration legislation'. In other words, the system of review, which is only one tier now—that is, the tribunal; somebody makes a determination and then they can go to the tribunal—is supposed to be so much better. But consistency is a good thing when you are getting articles written about you in the newspapers. Here is an article with the headline `Merciful Ruddock gives more rejected migrants a lifeline'. It talks about how the minister has made more determinations in favour of cases than his predecessors. I applaud that. But, if there is a need for 605 visas to be granted in one year by the minister, overriding the tribunal, does that mean that the extensive merits review is really positive in doing its job and that there is no need for further consideration? How can you have it both ways, Minister? How can you say, `I have determined so many cases where the tribunal has got it wrong, I should be complimented,' and at the same time say that the review system is adequate and that you will not allow people access to the court? You cannot have it both ways. The minister should know that that argument does not stand up.</para><para>But, even if the merits review system were a positive one and even if the number of cases that were actually unjust were small, you would still need to be able to access the courts. That is part of the Australian system. However, the fact is that the system is unjust to thousands of people. That is why the minister has had such a massive increase in representations. People do not put representations to the minister for flippant reasons. They make representations to him because they feel that, despite compassionate reasons, they have not been given a hearing. If these cases exist, why shouldn't there be the possibility of review through the courts and through class actions? I do not know, but I think the minister seems to think that, if you get tough and show that you are tough about something and have a comprehensive single-minded approach to a problem rather than a focused approach to a problem, you might be able to get away with it—and anyway you give the impression to the community that you are doing something about what seems to be an issue. But that is not good enough. When we are dealing with these sorts of issues we need complex ways of approaching the problem.</para><para>The shadow minister said something which, respectfully, I disagree with. He said that it was not up to him to put forward the solutions; he said that the minister has all these people—the department, et cetera—and these are the people who can give him answers. The problem is that, if the department is the body that we are going to rely on for giving him answers, the answers and the advice that they have been giving the minister recently in relation to the issue which many members have spoken about—I refer to the detention issue—are totally unacceptable and mistaken. All I have to do here is read from an editorial. This is not my view; this is the view of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. Their editorial reads `Ruddock must see beyond his own rhetoric'. Many members have raised this issue, but let me just read a bit of this editorial. It says:</para><quote><para>What about the thousands of illegal immigrants languishing in our detention centres? What sort of Australia Day have they had? It's a question worth asking given that after being treated like criminals, most of them will become Australians—something our Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock would prefer we forget. </para><para>We do not condone people-smuggling, but there is something very wrong with our immigration detention policy. After two riots at Woomera and last week's unrest at Port Hedland, it is time to look at community-based alternatives, not increasing capacities, arming guards with sedative-filled syringes and putting up more barbed wire. But you won't hear much about alternatives from Mr Ruddock. Rather, it seems that every time there is a riot or a boatload of Iraqis reaches Ashmore Reef, Mr Ruddock's basest instincts come to the fore. To use the actions of a disruptive minority to clamp down on an innocent majority is cheap political point scoring. Will threatening rioters with deportation quell their anger and frustration? We doubt it. Will pamphlets warning would-be asylum seekers they will be racially vilified by us stop the problem of people-smuggling? You're kidding. Yet Mr Ruddock's rhetoric is limited to such knee-jerk responses.</para></quote><para>The editorial goes on, but the central point is this: why isn't the department of immigration working out alternativeswhy isn't the minister being presented with alternatives in this matter of detention? Other cases have been referred to by a number of honourable members here with respect to the minister's actions and determinations. So I am afraid that the shadow minister is wrong when he says, `It is up to the minister and the department to determine the alternatives.' The minister and the department have not been capable of putting forward alternatives in these matters; otherwise they would not have put forward this rubbish legislation. Can there be solutions to these matters? The parliamentary committee suggested a number of solutions. It talked, for example, about trying to get rid of abuses by tightening up on immigration agents, trying to explain to people what their legal rights are and providing more access to legal aid, and it put forward many other solutions to this matter that the department and the minister have not considered. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Danby</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>23956</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, Mr</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

It is very infrequent that a major foreign investment proposal carries with it adverse economic implications that are particular to it being foreign owned. Is it in Australia's interest to entrust the development of the North West Shelf to the national oil company of another country? This world-scale project produced exports of $3.6 billion in 1999, generating government revenue—excise, royalties and company tax—of $1.6 billion. It accounts for 1.1 per cent of Australia's GDP and directly and indirectly employs 80,000 people. The development of the fourth LNG train—including a second trunkline and offshore facilities—will have a capital cost of $3 billion and will employ 2,000 people during development. Where is the precedent for a country allowing strategic control of the development of its resources to be subordinated to the other commercial interests of a foreign company?</para></talk.start><para>Shell has a substantial stake in similar projects in Malaysia, Brunei and Oman, and a new one in Russia—Sakhalin Island, north of Japan—that are competitors with Australia for its Asia-Pacific liquid natural gas market. These countries will not hesitate to intervene to protect their own national interests at the expense of Australia. To maintain shareholder value, Shell must apply high hurdle rates of return across the company when considering new investments. Among world-scale LNG projects, the North West Shelf is probably one of the higher cost operations. If Shell controls alternative resources and has any reluctance to develop the North West Shelf, then we can assume that it will be much less enthusiastic about committing capital to Australian exploration than would an independent Woodside. </para><para>Australia's level of self-sufficiency in the production of petroleum is declining, so any reduction in exploration effort over our most prospective acreage is going to impact heavily on the balance of trade in a few years. Shell may argue that taking over Woodside would only give it a 33.4 per cent share of the North West Shelf and other participants could still outvote it on questions of investment. However, the position of operator it would acquire would put Shell in the driver's seat controlling the process with double its current weight in negotiations. The primary responsibility of the directors of Woodside is to advise the shareholders if the price on offer represents full value or better for the asset; it is not to determine the national interest. They could seek a white knight—Australian or foreign—who does not have the conflicting interests that Shell has and who is prepared to give the shareholders full value. At the end of the day, the Foreign Investment Review Board is there to advise the government of the day. It does not determine the national interest. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, it is the Treasurer who ultimately has the responsibility for determining the national interest.</para><para>In the case of this application, the national interest is that exploration and development of the North West Shelf not be impeded by the conflicting interests of Shell. The Treasurer must first consider whether the non-Shell joint venture partners have both the information base and the influence over joint venture processes to ensure the optimum development of the resource when that is at the expense of Shell's other interests.</para><para>Recent newspaper reports indicate that at least one of the non-Shell joint venture partners has serious concerns that they would not have that control if Shell were the operator. If the Treasurer cannot satisfy himself and publicly demonstrate that this national interest test is met by the current application, he can consider whether there are enforceable conditions that he could impose that would protect the national interest. If the Treasurer is unable to develop an effective set of conditions that are acceptable to Shell or if the company is unable or unwilling to amend its application to satisfy the national interest test, then it should withdraw its application to avoid rejection. If the Treasurer fails to ensure that the development of the North West Shelf cannot be impeded by Shell, he must admit that Australia no longer has foreign investment controls based on an effective national interest test.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kalgoorlie Electorate: Rural Clinical School</title><page.no>23957</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>23957</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I bring to the attention of the House the great benefits and injection of confidence that this morning's announcement of funding for a rural clinical school will have in my electorate of Kalgoorlie. As you will be aware, my electorate is primarily rural and many of the areas are remote beyond normal comprehension and the region often finds it difficult to attract and retain medical staff. We also have the age old problem of our youth having to move to the cities to obtain the high level of training necessary for careers in such fields as health and medicine. Unfortunately, often they do not return and we lose this talent permanently to other metropolitan areas. This is about to change. My colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, has today announced that Kalgoorlie will receive a new rural clinical school as part of this government's `More doctors, better services' package. This is a major and exciting boost for my electorate which will reap tremendous benefits from new employment, infrastructure and health care services resulting directly and indirectly from this $3 million per annum commitment from the federal government.</para></talk.start><para>This school will provide practical and clinical experience for medical students in the latter part of their degree. This alone is likely to result in immense long-term benefits, with evidence being that health professionals who have a rural background and those educated in rural areas are much more likely to work in a rural environment after graduation. We want to be able to keep our country doctors in the country. This initiative will encourage more rural students to study medicine and will increase the opportunities for nursing and related health workers to gain experience working in rural communities. There is, of course, the benefits that will flow on from the recruitment of high level academics and the provision of much needed clinical services to the local communities. The sustained advantages to our rural communities will also be enhanced with the provision of additional resources, benefits by way of increased clinical support, research capacity and increased educational opportunities to existing health professionals. </para><para>This is a commitment to establish a high quality rural network of educational and academic facilities that will not only enable but encourage medical and health science students to undertake significant periods of their training in the country. I congratulate the government for making this commitment to the future of health services in country Australia generally but, most specifically, I congratulate the minister for including Kalgoorlie in that funding and for recognising the extremely hard work that enabled this to be the case with the contribution from the University of Western Australia.</para><para>This contribution will see, in stage one, a base central facility created in Kalgoorlie and later in Geraldton. The second stage will include campuses in Albany, Bunbury and Busselton. This will, for the first time, create a network of health professionals in the Kalgoorlie area and will address the problem of lack of peer group interaction that is currently suffered by medical staff in that region. We hope that it will ease the plight of so many rural towns throughout my electorate that suffer from a shortage of nursing staff and doctors. Great agony ensues from not having doctors in those communities. I have said it before and I will say it again: if we do not train medical students in the country hospitals, when they are qualified there is almost no chance of their practising in the country. I congratulate the minister once again on honouring Kalgoorlie in such a way and providing an opportunity to expand rural medical facilities in my electorate.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Stirling Electorate: Aged Care Facilities</title><page.no>23958</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>23958</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JANN McFARLANE</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to bring to the House concerns raised by my constituents about aged care facilities in Stirling—particularly the need for more nursing home beds.

I support the statement of  the shadow minister for family services and the aged, Senator Chris Evans, who, in response to the report, said:</para><quote><para>Western Australia now has a shortage of 699 residential aged care beds against the Government's target of 90 beds per 1000 persons aged 70 and over. In 1996, when the Howard Government came to office, Western Australia was 124 beds above the target.</para><para>The Productivity Commission confirms that across Western Australia people are waiting longer to get into nursing homes. Currently, 17% of people assessed as needing a nursing home bed wait more than 3 months to find one, compared to just 3% three years ago.</para></quote><para>I agree with Senator Evans's view that the Howard government's failure to manage the aged care system means that the frail aged and their families in Western Australia are being forced to wait months and months to access the beds and the care they need. Senator Evans also points out:</para><quote><para>... the Report to be released tomorrow confirms what people in Western Australia already know. The Howard Government is failing to treat the frail aged and their families with the care and respect they deserve.</para></quote><para>In my electorate of Stirling families still come to my office seeking help in getting an elderly family member—usually a parent—off a waiting list and into a bed. I feel frustrated that my efforts have rarely been successful because there are not enough nursing home or aged care beds available.  </para><para>I will give an example of a recent crisis. After Christmas, a deplorable situation occurred in Stirling with ward 5 in Osborne Park Hospital. The situation upset the patients, their families, the hospital staff and the local community. Patients were cleared out of ward 5—a medical ward—so that it could be used as a respite care facility for elderly people. Why was a hospital ward used for this purpose? It is because of a gap in aged care facilities. What were the concerns of the people involved? The families of the elderly people would have preferred that their family members received respite care in an aged care facility rather than in a medical facility. The nurses and other staff were afraid that their jobs would go and that the hospital would be turned into an aged care facility. The local community were concerned that they would lose their medical facility. These concerns have not been laid to rest as the Court state government and the Howard federal government have not been able to assure the community that funding will be given to meet the immediate need for more aged care beds.</para><para>I would like to point out to the House the basic principles of Labor's aged care policy as a path to follow. Labor recognises the vital contribution of older Australians to our community and will encourage and support them to live full, active and independent lives. Labor believes a secure, adequate income and access to good quality, appropriate health and aged care services when they are needed are essential to older Australians' peace of mind. Labor believes Australians' access to aged care services should be on the basis of their need for that care and not on their ability to pay or where they live. Labor will continue to honour Australia's debt to veterans through programs of compensation, commemoration, income support, health care, aged care and housing assistance. In line with our principles of opportunity for older Australians, Labor recognises that most Australians remain healthy and continue to lead full, active and independent lives well into their 70s and 80s. Older Australians make a crucial contribution to the Australian community. I have brought this issue before the House in the hope that some of the budget windfall will be used to meet this critical need across Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Local Networks</title><page.no>23959</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>23959</page.no><name role="metadata">St Clair, Stuart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr St CLAIR</name><name.id>84B</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity, early in the new millennium, to raise an issue that is close to my heart.

Of course he would say that: he was a member of the Labor government that made deep cuts to funding for local roads in the early 1980s. Roads can survive for many years with minimal maintenance, but they will slowly degrade. That is what has happened to the local road networks: they have hit a wall because of Labor funding cuts 15 years ago.</para><para>Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition was also the Minister for Finance when the Keating Labor government blew out the biggest budget deficit in the nation's history and left a legacy of almost $100 billion in federal government debt.

Five days later, on 13 December 2000, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister proudly announced what everyone affected by aircraft noise in Sydney was dreading—the expansion of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Bankstown airport and the consignment of Badgerys Creek as a second airport for Sydney to the backburner. Five days after the parliament rose for the Christmas recess, the Howard government visited the most cynical and monumentally dishonest decision on the residents of Sydney, in particular my constituents in Lowe, from Drummoyne to Homebush West. The government did not have the guts to tell the parliament what it was proposing. That decision means the Howard government intends to promote the expansion of air traffic over Sydney and, at the same time, dishonour all its previous pledges to give people relief from aircraft noise and to ensure an equal and fair distribution of noise. </para></talk.start><para>During question time on the last sitting day before Christmas, I asked the Prime Minister a question about Kurnell as a possible site for a second airport for Sydney. He restated his government's commitment to the fair sharing of the noise burden among the people who live in Sydney. There was not a word from his lips about what he must surely have known at that time when he answered my question—that his government was going to put the boot into Sydney residents living close to the airport. What this government has shown is that all it has been interested in over the past five years is the need to fatten the calf—Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport—for the kill. The government's only agenda has been to make Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport a more valuable asset to flog to the private sector. The dishonesty of the government over Sydney's aircraft noise problems is breathtaking! </para><para>The government's shocking decision means only one thing: more aircraft over homes and schools in my electorate of Lowe when the planes should be flying over water and cow paddocks. At the end of question time today, I asked you, Mr Speaker, to follow up my question on notice No. 2046 to the Prime Minister, which I asked on 11 October 2000 and which has still not been answered by the Prime Minister. The question was as to whether he believes Sydney needs a second airport. Quite obviously, while he is Prime Minister, he does not think we need another airport in Sydney. However, he is quite happy to get into bed with the airline companies, the tourism industry, the shopkeepers at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the operators of the airport car park and the rail and road consortium who service the airport—all at the expense of those who suffer the horrendous effects of aircraft noise from Sydney airport. As I have said before in this House, as an airport Sydney operates very well as a shopping centre and a car park. </para><para>Today I put a stack of questions on notice to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Finance and Administration. The questions were associated with the government's Christmas present of more aircraft noise for the people of Sydney. They expose the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the government on this issue. The first question on notice I asked of the Prime Minister was whether he said that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport would not be sold until the noise problems at the airport had been sold. Obviously, I have asked a rhetorical question. The agenda of the government is clear. Obviously, it now proposes to flog off Sydney airport, with no commitment to a second airport and with a scandalous abandonment of its promises to provide Sydney residents with relief from aircraft noise. The government is interested only in rewarding its mates who have a vested interest in the prosperity of the airport. </para><para>The government's record on Sydney airport is appalling. The long-term operating plan is still to be fully implemented. My constituents in Lowe are still receiving 50 per cent more noise than the Howard government promised. With the latest decision to expand Sydney (Kingsford Smith) and Bankstown airports, all that the people of Sydney can look forward to under the Howard-Anderson government is greater environmental health and safety risks associated with even more large planes flying over a densely populated city. The government's record is just a litany of broken promises. The residents of Sydney who live close to the airport have been betrayed. The government are only interested in collecting another $4 billion of revenue for the sale of the airport and they are only interested in saving the hides of the members for Macquarie, Lindsay and Parramatta who would be affected by Badgerys Creek. We need a second airport. We need a second airport as soon as possible. We need a second major airport to service the needs of Sydney, and while ever this government proposes to expand Sydney airport it is only promoting the disaster waiting to happen.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Services: Rural and Regional Australia</title><page.no>23961</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>23961</page.no><name role="metadata">Forrest, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FORREST</name><name.id>NV5</name.id><electorate>Mallee</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Thank you, Mr Speaker, for an opportunity to talk about the training of rural doctors, which is an issue that has confronted members of parliament representing rural Australia in this place for some time. Today I would like to put on the record appreciation to the government, particularly the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, for an initiative today which is the second stage of rolling out a national rural health education and training network right across Australia. This initiative came in a welcome announcement in last year's budget in May, when the coalition government committed $562 million to improving rural and regional health, through a package called More Doctors, Better Services. Mr Speaker, you would understand even in Wakefield that the issue of attracting doctors to rural areas is much enhanced if the doctors concerned have an affinity with rural areas. What better way to develop that affinity than to ensure they do elements of their training out there amongst those wonderful communities that we represent and get a feel for the lifestyle and the people? From that comes a commitment to want to stay. </para></talk.start><para>Today the minister announced the location of nine new rural clinical schools and two new university departments of rural health extending across much of rural and remote Australia. I am very grateful that included in these initiatives is a training facility that extends right along the River Murray, through the member for Murray's constituency, extending all the way from north-western Victoria where my constituents live to the east of Gippsland, and initiatives throughout Wakefield, south-west Victoria, extending right up through remote New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. This is welcome news to the constituents of Mallee. There are many young people out there who would like to do medicine, quite happy to go to the big metropolis for the initial few years of their training but quite anxious to get back home and train amongst the people to whom they will be required to deliver services. This program has the flexibility to be able to deliver that. Funding of $117.6 million over the next four years has been committed today to deliver specifically this form of training. Dr Wooldridge today announced the hosting of new rural clinical school facilities for Coffs Harbour, Dubbo, Rockhampton and Toowoomba in Queensland, Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Bairnsdale, Mildura and Shepparton in Victoria, Burnie in Tasmania, Whyalla in South Australia, and your heartland, Mr Speaker, the Riverland in South Australia—all welcome news. The doctors in the Mildura district today were applauding the minister for hearing this very needy concern. I am looking forward to the day when there will be no more letters requesting my support in attracting foreign doctors, because we will have well-trained, specifically rural trained, Aussie doctors willing and wanting to practise in rural Australia. Many rural doctors in fact earn quite generous incomes. A sole practitioner in a small country community can do quite well, but he just needs a little bit of support to have some time of respite for himself rather than work seven days a week. Many of those rural doctors have an enormous commitment but are burning out from trying to deliver a service. They do not want to see the rural communities that they have come to respect enough to want to live there short-changed of the quality of services provided.</para><para>I am looking forward to the rolling out of this program. I am extremely grateful to Dr Wooldridge, who has responded magnificently to the representations that have been made to him in the last five years since the coalition have been in government. He is to be commended for making these responses. I am sure he will be very pleased at the very constructive and positive way in which rural Australia will pick up these initiatives. I am grateful for the support provided by the universities, who have leapt to the challenge the government has provided. As I say, this provides an opportunity to focus on other important issues and to have our rural doctor access and quality problems resolved.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>23962</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 10.59 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>23962</page.no><id.no>R1128</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Erratum</title><page.no>23962</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>On 7 December 2000, at page 23642, the incorrect Senate amendments were inserted into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000.

if so, (a) why will the General Orders of the NT police be used as the means to make these changes rather than legislation passed after proper parliamentary scrutiny and (b) on what grounds is the Federal Government satisfied that internal police orders are a sufficiently open mechanism by which to make the proposed changes.</para><para>	(3) With regard to the agreement to require police to divert at the pre-charge stage in the case of minor offences, but at the same time to maintain the mandatory sentencing provisions, is there a risk that people accused of an offence will be forced to admit guilt to avoid going to court and being sentenced mandatorily;

However, an offence involving unlawful entry would not be a minor offence.</para><para>	(2) (a) (b) Legislative amendments to the Police Administration Act to enable the pre-charge diversion of juveniles by police have been passed in the Northern Territory Parliament, and as at 23 November 2000 was awaiting assent.  An interim policy on pre-court diversion was gazetted on 24 August 2000 by the Northern Territory Police Commissioner.  The policy will be superseded by General Orders, once the legislative amendments come into effect. </para><para>	(3) Under the agreement admission to the offence is not a prerequisite for a juvenile to undergo diversion but may be taken into account in the diversion process.  When apprehended by police, juveniles will have diversion explained to them.  If a juvenile consents to being diverted, the juvenile will avoid going to court. If the juvenile does opt to go to court, the court will determine guilt or innocence. If the juvenile is found guilty, the court can refer the juvenile to a diversionary programme for a second conviction for a specified offence. While detention can occur when the court does not choose to divert for a second conviction, detention is only mandatory for a third conviction of a specified offence. </para><para>	With pre-charge diversion, it is open to a juvenile to follow the normal judicial procedure and attend court.  Participation in a pre-charge diversionary programme is not tantamount to conviction and is intended to be a beneficial option for a young person.</para><para>	(4) Under the agreement, “divert for minor offences” means that police are required to offer diversion to juveniles apprehended for minor offences (as defined by the agreement) by way of warnings, cautions, or referral to conference or a community-based programme, except in circumstances where the juvenile is considered unsuitable because the juvenile continues to commit many minor offences within a short period of time.</para><para>	(5) A juvenile does not have to admit guilt prior to being offered diversion under the pre-charge diversion scheme.  There is no set limit on how many times a juvenile can be diverted but juveniles who continue to commit minor offences (for example offences on five different occasions within six months for which they have been diverted) may not be suitable for further diversion.  Taking into account all the circumstances, the police may continue to provide diversion to such juveniles.</para><para>	(6) (a) (b) Under the agreement, cautions can be used where juveniles are apprehended for minor offences (as defined under the agreement) and for other offences.  The interim diversion policy issued by the Northern Territory Police Commissioner indicates that very serious offences such as rape and murder will not be subject to diversion.  Such `excluded offences' will be defined in the General Orders.</para><para>	(7) The Government is not aware of such allegations.  Failure to comply with General Orders is a breach of discipline under s.79 of the Police Administration Act and renders the officer liable to penalty including possible dismissal.  The Northern Territory Ombudsman is also empowered to investigate any action taken, or refusal or failure to take action, by a member of the Northern Territory Police where the action is related to the performance of the member's powers, duties or functions as a member of the Northern Territory Police.</para><para>	(8) (a) To enable on-going monitoring and to assist with reviews,  the Northern Territory Government will be providing to the Commonwealth performance information in relation to the operation of the juvenile diversion scheme and the Aboriginal Interpreter Service at six monthly intervals for the duration of the agreement.  Further performance information will be provided specifically for the twelve month review and the Commonwealth will be consulting stakeholders as part of that review.</para><para>		(b) Monitoring and review will be by officers of relevant Commonwealth departments and the federal Attorney-General's office.  It has not yet been determined how a further full review in the fourth year is to be conducted.</para><para>		(c) The agreement is not about the mandatory detention laws themselves.  The Commonwealth recognises that the Northern Territory Government has considered it appropriate to introduce mandatory detention laws. However, the Commonwealth is concerned about the potential impact of mandatory detention laws on young people under the age of 18, which is why the agreement is designed to divert juveniles away from the criminal justice system. </para><para>		(d) A review by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Commonwealth's review may be an unnecessary duplication of effort. </para><para>	(9) The agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, which has been made public, is the package for the juvenile pre-charge diversion scheme.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Murrumbateman</title><page.no>23974</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1758)</subtitle><id.no>1758</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23974</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) What is the design capacity of the declared road reservation for land on the eastern side of the Murrumbateman by-pass, NSW, including the (a) size of the reserve, (b) vehicle speed and (c) number of carriageway of the road used as the basis of determining that reserve.</para><para>	(2) When was this reservation made, and by whom was it made.</para></quote><para>	(3) Are other reserves declared in the vicinity of Murrumbateman.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23974</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows.</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) (a), (b) &amp; (c)</para><para>I presume this question relates to a letter, copies of which appear to have been circulated in the Murrumbateman community, in which there was a reference to a reservation for a bypass on the eastern side of Murrumbateman intended for a two lane 60km/h road.

No such request has been received. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget: Contribution to National Savings</title><page.no>23991</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2057)</subtitle><id.no>2057</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23991</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Latham</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Further to his answer to questions No. 578 (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 18 November 1996, page 7035) and No. 3058 (<inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 15 July 1998, page 6263), does the Government plan to produce budget estimates on an expenditure tax basis.</para><para>(2) Would this allow the Government to publish figures regarding the net budget contribution to national savings.</para><para>(3) Does the Government's Charter of Budget Honesty or other budget guidelines currently require the publication of figures showing the net budget contribution to national savings.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23991</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	No.</para><para>(2)	The net budget contribution to national savings is determined by both the level of public savings directly contributed towards national savings, and the effect that budgetary policies have on private savings' contribution towards national savings.  </para><para>The fiscal budget balance represents the Commonwealth's direct contribution to the national savings and investment imbalance, which in turn approximates the nation's current account deficit.  </para><para>From a national perspective, movements in government savings may be partially offset by changes in private saving.

Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honorable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, Essendon Airport is to remain a general aviation airport to be regulated under the Airports Act 1996 with the development of the land to be in accordance with the lease provisions and that Act. Under the Act, the airport lessee is prevented from carrying on substantial trading or financial activities other than those relating to the operation and /or development of the Airport or that are incidental to the operation and /or development of the Airport. In the assessment of bids, attention will be paid to ensuring the proponent has an appropriate mix of financial strength and managerial capability to ensure that these requirements are likely to be met.</para><para>(2)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, the Airports Act 1996 precludes foreign ownership in the Airport in excess of 49%.</para><para>(3)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, Essendon Airport, like any other licensed aerodrome, is required to meet regulations and standards set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) for the safe operation of an airport.  In addition, CASA carries out compliance checks on the Airport's application of its standards.  The Commonwealth proposes to sell its shares in Essendon Airport Limited, which currently leases the land occupied by the Airport, and there are no changes envisaged to the Airport's existing boundaries.</para><para>(4)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, I understand that Essendon Airport Limited management have had previous discussions with the Victorian Government in relation to possible changes in the alignment of the Tullamarine/Calder interchange.  I am not aware of any current discussions between these parties.</para><para>(5)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, as is the case with all General Aviation Airports, Essendon Airport has no dedicated aviation rescue or fire fighting service.  The Airport has well rehearsed Aerodrome emergency procedures developed in accordance with Civil Aviation Regulations and in consultation with Victoria Police, the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board, the Ambulance Service of Victoria and other agencies.  Those procedures have local emergency services notified by Airservices Australia air traffic controllers when local fire, ambulance and police units are required at the Airport.   They also provide for airport administrative arrangements to assist emergency services personnel attending, and operating on, the Airport.  An Aerodrome Emergency exercise is held annually and the procedures are reviewed at least semi annually as well as after any live emergency or training exercises. These arrangements would continue under any new operator.</para><para>(6)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, the Government has considered what impact a developed Essendon Airport will have on Tullamarine.  Essendon Airport will continue to cater principally for general aviation activities and emergency services such as Air Ambulance Victoria and the Victorian Police Air Wing.  Current curfew and noise limitations will be formalised in Regulations.  Essendon's operations will therefore continue to complement those at Tullamarine. </para><para>(7)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, the Airports Act 1996 and the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations 1997 set out a comprehensive environment regulatory regime for the airport site.  That regime includes the development and implementation of an approved airport environment strategy that sets out how the airport owner will operate the Airport to safeguard and improve the environment.  Potential purchasers of shares in Essendon Airport Limited will need to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements of the environment protection regime and demonstrate a commitment to the implementation of the approved environment strategy for Essendon Airport.</para><para>(8)	The Commonwealth does not set a reserve price for such sales.  The Commonwealth will receive from its advisers as part of the sale process, valuation advice relating to Essendon Airport Limited which the Commonwealth will use as part of its assessment of bids against the sale objectives. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Essendon Airport Sale</title><page.no>23998</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2146)</subtitle><id.no>2146</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>23998</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 8 November 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	On what date was the decision to keep Essendon Airport open made.</para><para>(2)	Who was informed of the decision prior to its announcement in Parliament on 31 October 2000.</para><para>(3)	Was the Victorian Government informed of the decision prior to its announcement in Parliament on 31 October 2000; if so, (a) on what date and at what time was the Victorian Government informed, (b) who made the contact with the Victorian Government and (c) who was contacted.</para><para>(4)	Was the Victorian Opposition informed of the decision prior to its announcement in Parliament on 31 October 2000; if so, (a) on what date and at what time was the Victorian Opposition informed, (b) who made the contact with the Victorian Opposition and (c) who was contacted.</para><para>(5)	Prior to making the decision to keep Essendon Airport open, was a study undertaken of Victoria's aviation needs; if so, (a) what was the nature of the study, (b) by whom was the study conducted, (c) what consultation process was used and (d) what were the results of the study.</para><para>(6)	Was he aware of any similar study being undertaken by the Victorian Government; if so, (a) on what date was he advised such a study was to be undertaken, (b) was the study completed prior to making the decision to keep Essendon Airport open and (c) what were the results of the study.</para><para>(7)	When and by what process will the Commonwealth shares in Essendon Airport Limited be sold.</para><para>(8)	What mechanism will be used to ensure the purchaser of the shares continues to operate Essendon Airport as an airport.</para><para>(9)	In the event that Essendon Airport Ltd is liquidated, placed in receivership, placed under administration or otherwise faces financial difficulties, how will the Commonwealth ensure that Essendon Airport continues to function as an airport.</para><para>(10)	What control will the Commonwealth Government have on the level of aeronautical charges after the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in Essendon Airport Ltd.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>23998</page.no><name role="metadata">Fahey, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fahey</name><name.id>HQ5</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honorable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	30 October 2000.</para><para>(2)	Commonwealth Departments and agencies.</para><para>(3)	The Victorian Premier was written to on 31 October 2000 advising him of the Commonwealth's decision.</para><para>(4)	Not so far as I or my office are aware.</para><para>(5)	As advised by my department, in consultation with DOTRS, a study was undertaken to provide the Commonwealth with advice on options to divest its shareholding in Essendon Airport Limited.

discussion with veterans groups concerning the construction of an Australian national memorial to service in Malaya and Borneo.</para><para>	(2) The Government acknowledges that national memorials of this nature play an important part in recording the service and sacrifice of Australians at war.  The existing memorials in Anzac Parade in Canberra form an impressive commemorative axis from the Australian War Memorial to Lake Burley Griffin and Parliament House.  This axis is a key feature of Walter Burley Griffin's original 1912 plan for Canberra.</para><para>	It is not the role of the Government to construct these national memorials.  My role, in conjunction with the National Capital Authority and other arms of government, is to examine proposals to ensure that the standards comply with those envisaged in Burley Griffin's plan.  The completed work would need to be of notable design and of lasting quality to minimise maintenance and add value to the existing memorials of Anzac Parade.</para><para>	Proposals for new memorials need an active organisation able to attract sufficient public support to raise the necessary funds for the construction.  Recent examples of new memorials include the Australian Service Nurses National Memorial and the Australian National Korean War Memorial.  In each case very active committees were formed and State Government and veteran organisations provided strong financial support.  While considerable Federal Government financial assistance was still necessary when public fund-raising failed to meet the target in each case, this form of support cannot be relied upon for future memorials.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Office of Small Business: Report</title><page.no>24021</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2241)</subtitle><id.no>2241</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24021</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 7 December 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Is he aware of a report prepared in 2000 by the Office of Small Business (OSB) on the impact of the Cabinet decision about the importation of second hand motor vehicles; if so, (a) why was the report commissioned, (b) who authorised the commissioning of the report and (c) when was the report provided to the Government.</para><para>(2)	Did the low volume industry assist in the preparation of this report; if so, has OSB provided a copy to the low volume industry; if not, why not.</para><para>(3)	Will he table the report in Parliament.</para><para>(4)	Was the report required because the Regulatory Impact Statement on the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 identified a threat of significant small businesses closures in this industry.</para><para>(5)	Does the report recognise the low volume industry as a major provider of jobs for small businesses throughout Australia.</para><para>(6)	Will the Government revoke existing licences in May 2002 that were issued for the life of a model for vehicles no longer eligible under the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme (SEVS); if so, (a) why and (b) what compensation will be offered to the low volume industry.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24021</page.no><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Reith</name><name.id>WI4</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) (a) to (c)	After discussions with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, it was agreed that the Office of Small Business (OSB) (in consultation with the Ministers' Departments) should report on the impact on small business of the Government decision to replace the Low Volume Scheme (LVS) with the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme (SEVS).

This advises that limited information of the visa applicant may be disclosed to the nominator / sponsor in accordance with Information Privacy Principle 11.1.a:</para><para> “10.1 Where a sponsor, or a Member of Parliament (including a Member's staff) acting on behalf of a sponsor, seeks access to personal information of an applicant, only as much information may be disclosed as the applicant would be reasonably likely to expect would be disclosed to the sponsor (that is, IPP 11(1)(a) applies).

Assessments based on occupational considerations, for example, would not normally give rise to privacy concerns.  Assessments based on health or character, however, would normally be regarded as sensitive and details would not normally be released without the consent of the applicant.</para><quote><para>10.2 Certain general information is non-personal in nature and can be disclosed. Such information includes:</para></quote><para>·	advice on processing times;</para><para>·	advice on requirements which apply to a particular visa class;</para><para>·	passmark, pooling provisions, etc.”</para><quote><para>To make additional disclosures, the visa applicant's consent must be obtained (Information Privacy Principle 11.1.b), or the sponsor may ask the visa applicant directly for the information.  There is no intention to amend the Migration Act to authorise such disclosures of a visa applicant's personal information to a sponsor on the grounds of public interest.</para><para>	(3) A breakdown of the specific reasons for refusal of a permanent (second stage) Spouse visa is not available, however, anecdotally most spouse applications are refused because applicants no longer meet the spouse definition of the Migration Regulations due to the breakdown of the relationship.</para><para>Data on the total number of persons who are refused the grant of permanent (second stage) Spouse visa is an indicator of the number of relationships that cease due to separation or divorce.  Spouse visa applicants at the permanent stage may be refused for a number of reasons including failure to meet the health and character requirements; and no longer being in a continuing and genuine spouse relationship. </para><para>For the Program Year 1999-2000, of the 9,500 decisions made on applications for a permanent Spouse visa where the spouse was granted a provisional (first stage) visa at an overseas post, less than 4 percent were refused the permanent (second stage) visa.  A further 3 percent of holders of the provisional visa elected to withdraw their application for the permanent Spouse visa before a decision was made. </para><para>	(4) The overall Spouse visa (first stage) refusal rate of 14 per cent for offshore and 9 per cent for onshore lodged cases for the 1999-2000 Program year would mostly reflect refusals on the grounds that a delegated decision-maker did not consider the relationship to be genuine and ongoing.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
