                        <para>-  As the right honorable gentleman will have gathered from the reports, the situation in Algeria is extremely serious. The essential facts are that Algeria at present is a department of France. It is regarded constitutionally as a part of metropolitan France, and returns deputies to the French chamber. There are about 1,000,000 Frenchmen in a total population of about 8,000,000 in Algeria. The rebellion - I think it can be called that - has been going on since 1954. The French put forward a proposal, called the Loi cadre, about two years ago, under which Algeria would be divided into five regions, under a federal system which would provide for its own  president  and its own elected house, the only reserve subjects being defence and foreign affairs; but that has not been accepted by the rebels, who will accept nothing, apparently, other than complete independence. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The matter, as can be imagined, has been before the United Nations on more than one occasion - I think on two or three occasions. The last one that remains in my mind was at the last Assembly in 1957, when a simple resolution was passed by the necessary two-thirds majority merely to the effect that the situation should be resolved by peaceful means. It is an extremely serious situation having, as could be imagined, an intense impact on politics in metropolitan France. I should not like to make any prediction as to the outcome -of it. It is said that there are no fewer than 400,000 French troops in Algeria. They have been there for some time, and their number is appreciably more than half the ground forces of metropolitan France. </para>

                            <para>- The French have been attempting to keep order against apparently, an organized and self-perpetuating body of widely dispersed rebels. The figures for the rebels, which have been given at various times and from various sources, have been between 15,000 and 20,000, but as the rebels suffer casualties, their numbers, as I say, appear to be replaced almost automatically from the indigenous population. There is nothing more that can be said at this moment, except that I think that all sides in this House will very greatly deplore this situation of urgent importance in Algeria. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister for the Interior. By way of explanation, I refer to the request by the Cowra Municipal Council that it be allowed to purchase the land and services of the former Cowra military camp. I now ask the Minister: Is he aware that it is estimated that there is Â£100,000 worth of services, by way of roads, electricity, water supply, and so on, at this camp? Is he also aware that the local council could use these services in the national good, for decentralization and other purposes? Will he give the council the first offer of these services, and if so, when is it likely that a decision may be expected? </para>

                        <para>- I have been rather awaiting the return of the honorable member to the House to acquaint him with a decision which has been made in this case. After his long period of intensive representations on behalf of the council, I am afraid that the answer may be somewhat disappointing. I am aware of the fact that the original cost of the installation of engineering services at this camp has been variously estimated and guessed at as a figure somewhat approaching that mentioned by the honorable member; but I have sought the advice of officers of the Department of Works who were associated with this type of war-time installation, and I understand that the installations were never designed for a very long life and, indeed, were put down in a way which provides a most inefficient pattern of engineering services, for possible subdivision. </para>

                    <para>I have also considered the somewhat nebulous proposals put to me by the Cowra Municipal Council for taking over this land, and I have sought the advice of the Department of Agriculture in New South Wales, and other parties, about the proposals. That has all been done in the hope of promoting some sort of compromise between the previous owner of the land, who definitely has rights, and the municipal council, which claims some rights in the matter; but unfortunately the council, as I am sure the honorable gentleman will know, has taken an all-or-nothing stand, and it has not been possible to bring about the kind of situation that he desires. The long and short of the matter is that, having been compulsorily acquired for defence purposes, and the land being no longer required by the Commonwealth for those or any other purposes, it is the considered view of the Government that the weight of obligation to the previous owner, while not absolute, is such as to demand that the first offer should be made to him at current valuation. I expect to make such an offer in the course of the next week or two, when it is possible to complete valuations now under way. </para>

I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to support the Premier of New South Wales, who is at present making overtures in the United States of America for much-needed industries to relieve unemployment in the mining community. My question and my plea for the co-operation of the Commonwealth Government are necessary, as an approach is being made by the Premier of New South Wales to the international finance corporation for capital to purchase industrial plant and other capital goods.

                        <para>- The Government has been ready to co-operate with the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of any other State in seeking to achieve the objective of inducing appropriate overseas companies to come to Australia to establish businesses. To the extent that it is necessary for the Department of Trade to consult with the Treasurer or the Minister for National Development in this matter, I point out that the department is not only willing to do so but does so. When any representative of Australia, public or private, is seeking to induce overseas capital to come to Australia, it is necessary for him to be in a position to give authentic information that is critical to the interests of overseas investors in respect of our exchange control laws and regulations, our import licensing laws and practices and a variety of other things. In this regard, the Department of Trade is continuously active in seeing that interested parties who approach it may be fully equipped with this information. Indeed, it always volunteers to State governments, or missions organized by State governments, full information on these particular points so that they may not only be fully equipped themselves but also see that the potential investors in Australia are not by accident left without full information concerning circumstances here. </para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Air, who represents the Minister for Civil Aviation in this chamber. Is it a fact that there is a real need for a small airliner for certain outback services? Is it also a fact that such a small airliner would serve those areas where the loading can never justify the use of aircraft as large as the DC3? Further, is it a fact that, of all the 220 aerodromes in Australia, only 20 or 30 can handle aircraft larger than a DC3? If these are facts, is it true that it would cost some Â£30,000,000 to enlarge and improve the remaining 200 aerodromes to make them suitable for modern airliners? Does the Minister believe that, to avoid this tremendous capital expenditure, it would be more suitable to build a small airliner to use the aerodromes in their existing conditions? If so, will the Government consider placing a developmental order for this type of small passenger aircraft? </para>

                        <para>-  I think it is correct, as a general statement, to say that there is a need for a small passenger aircraft for use on the less developed aerodromes in Australia, particularly in the outback. The honorable member has referred to some 220 aerodromes in Australia. I believe the total number throughout the whole of Australia is nearer 500. A far larger number than the 20 or 30 he referred to can handle DC3s or aircraft larger than DC3s, such as the DC4, and also some of the new aircraft whose production is planned for the future. Perhaps 30 would be the maximum number of aerodromes that could carry aircraft such as the Viscount, which has tyres of very high pressures and a heavy wheel loading. The honorable member has referred to a sum of, I think, Â£30,000,000, as being required to bring all the aerodromes in Australia up to such a standard that they could carry modern aircraft. That is a rough, not by any means exact, estimate of the expenditure believed to be necessary to bring all aerodromes required for future use in Australia up to the standard demanded by modern aircraft of the sort likely to be used by our air services. I cannot give a more precise estimate. I think the honorable member asked, finally, whether it would be more economical to develop a small airliner than to spend this sum on airfields. That is a question of policy to which I would not attempt to give a definite answer off the cuff. However, even if a small airliner capable of operating from country airfields were developed, it would still be necessary to spend a considerable sum on bringing and keeping our airfields up to such  a  standard that large and modern aircraft could be used on the ordinary routes. </para>

                        <para>-  As a result of a report made to me by the honorable member for Darling Downs, who recently successfully led an important mission to that area, the Government is aware that, due to some recession in, I think, rubber and tin prices in certain countries and, I understand, to a less than average rice crop in Thailand, conditions are not as buoyant in Southeast Asia as we, and certainly the people of those countries, would like. To that extent, it is perhaps a little more difficult to do business there. However, I believe that aggressive salesmanship by Australians with good quality goods to sell can secure very important orders for Australian industries. There are opportunities for the sale, in some cases, of foodstuffs, and, in others, of light engineering equipment, and certainly of items of heavy earth-moving equipment. Basic to the whole question is the general and growing disparity throughout the world between the prices for bulk commodities and the prices for industrial products.  It  is at the present time a prime point of the Government's policy to concern itself with this problem, not only in the interests of our own country, but in the hope that we can give some leadership in world circles towards inducing a consciousness on the part of the powerful and economically strong industrial countries, which are importers of raw materials, of the. desirability of taking concerted steps to. stabilize and strengthen the prices of basic raw materials, including foodstuffs and other commodities, throughout the world- We know, as a government, that unless there is a restoration of equilibrium between commodity prices and industrial prices there will be neither economic stability nor- political stability in the primary exporting countries of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Postmaster-General. Is it a fact that letters posted in the outer suburbs of Sydney, can take two or more days to be delivered in the city? Is it further a fact that on more than one occasion since Christmas overseas mail has remained unsorted for a fortnight in the basement of the General Post Office in Sydney? If these conditions, or anything like them, exist, can the Minister say why plans to erect a Â£5,000,000 mail depot at Redfern appear to have been indefinitely postponed, and also whether steps are being taken to recruit an adequate sorting staff? </para>

                            <para>- The first question of the honorable member referred to the time taken for delivery of mails posted in suburban areas in Sydney. Normally these mails do not take over two days to be delivered in the city. There may be odd occasions when, as a result of some congestion, the mails do take this length of time to be delivered, but this, I believe from my information, is not the normal practice. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>The second part of the honorable member's question referred to a statement recently made that there was considerable delay in sorting overseas mails. When my attention was drawn to this, I made some inquiries and found that just at Easter time there was some delay, but not to the extent suggested in the newspaper article,, in the sorting of overseas mail'. This was due, largely, to the fact that a number of ships were delivering their cargoes, including mails from overseas, and were making every effort to discharge them and clear the port before Easter. As a consequence, there was an unusual accumulation of mails which caused some delay, but not of the period mentioned. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member asked me also about plans for the establishment of a new mail sorting centre at Redfern. I answered a question on this subject by the honorable member for Banks a week or so ago. The honorable member for Bradfield stated that there had been some talk to the effect that the proposal for the establishment of this building had been postponed indefinitely. That is not correct. As a matter of fact,  1  think that about twenty minutes from now evidence will be given of the fact that the matter is proceeding. The need for this building is well recognized. It is a project which will take a considerable time to complete, but when it is finished it will provide needed relief not only for the sorting of mails but also from the traffic congestion in the streets of Sydney. I assure the honorable member that the proposal has not been postponed and work on it will proceed as rapidly as the other numerous demands on the finances available to the department permit. </para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to you, Mr. Speaker. If a perusal of the " Hansard " record for this last sessional period is made it will be found that Ministers have rarely, if ever, been willing to make ministerial statements by leave, but have elected to have questions asked by their supporters and make extensive replies even with the assistance of notes. This practice has denied to honorable members the full opportunity of questioning Ministers. T should like to ask what protection is available to honorable members to safeguard against what is surely an abrogation of the Standing Orders of this Parliament. </para>

I know of certain standing orders under which I can endeavour to keep them quiet, as an example to others, and so on, but the form of a Minister's reply to a question rests entirely with the Minister himself. I think it is desirable that the length of a reply, particularly on an occasion of this kind, should he taken into consideration. I feel sure that if attention is directed to this, there is no doubt that Ministers will respond in their own way. </para>

                        <para>-  I ask the Minister for Social Services: Has the means test with respect to home property been amended to provide that in some instances, in future, the value of land on which a house has been constructed will be taken into consideration when assessing the rate of pension payable to age pensioners? Naturally, I am referring, in this instance, to small country holdings. Previously, as the Minister will know, land not separated by a road or by intervening properties was not taken into account for this purpose- Is the Minister aware that the amended regulation will create serious difficulties for age pensioners and other classes of pensioner who reside in a home on a property which they are no longer able to work? Is it a fact that this discriminatory practice has not been adopted by the Repatriation Department in assessing property values for service pension purposes? Does this mean, in effect, that there could be a considerable difference between the rate of pension payable to an age pensioner under the amended regulation and the rate paid to a service pensioner? If that is so, will the Minister reconsider a decision which has created, in my opinion, an extremely serious anomaly? </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge of any amendment of any legislation concerning pensions! The application of the means test to property remains unchanged. The means test is applied by the Department of Social Services in the most liberal and generous way, to give the maximum benefit to an applicant whenever a legitimate case can be made out for consideration by the department. </para>

I have no doubt that there is scope for, and that there will continue to be scope for, an exchange of views. I offer the observation that the impending Commonwealth conference, which is to take place in Canada in, I think, September, would appear to provide the best early opportunity for a conference between the Commonwealth countries to examine the issues which the honorable member has so properly raised. </para>

                            <para>- I am expressing the view that there is no doubt that this conference between Commonwealth countries on economic and trade matters is bound to take into account the very real, growing and quite serious problem of the disparity between commodity prices and industrial prices generally. It may well be decided that as this is a world-wide problem, no adequate conclusion can be reached merely by agreement between the Commonwealth countries. If that conclusion is reached, it may well follow that there will be a contact with other countries concerned, perhaps through the United Nations, or perhaps directly. I am sure that the problem is so real that it will not be allowed to rest without full consultation and without every step being taken to see that the great and powerful industrial nations of the world are made aware of the consequences of failure to adjust this price disparity. </para>

Is it also a fact that the Attorney-General, the Minister for Repatriation, and the honorable member for Moreton also propose to retire in the near future? If so, will the Treasurer, in fairness to himself and the other honorable members concerned, arrange for a joint statement to be made denying the widely circulated rumour that they propose to form the nucleus of an organization being established in this city by a certain individual who has recently advertised for staff in the " Canberra Times " at parliamentary rates of pay? </para>

                        <para>- About a fortnight ago elections were held in South Korea.. There are two main parties in South Korea - the Liberal party and the Democratic party. There are also a number of splinter parties and some independent candidates. The Liberal party was formed a great many years ago by Dr. Syngman Rhee, the present  President.  The elections resulted in some loss of seats by the Liberal party, but it still retained a comfortable majority. The elections were held without incident of any consequence at all. On behalf of the United Nations, and with the co-operation of the South Korean Government, the elections were observed by the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, on which Australia is represented. The result of the elections further consolidates the two-party system in South Korea and I think it is generally recognized that it was a substantial advance towards the further consolidation of democratic processes generally in South Korea. </para>

                    <para>With regard to North Korea, I think elections were held there about six months ago. There were candidates from only one party - the Communist party - and to everybody's surprise those candidates won all the seats. </para>

                        <para>- My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that policy-holders in the bankrupt Associated Dominions Assurance Society Proprietary Limited are still waiting for a first dividend to be paid to them? Is it true that policyholders have been waiting for more than five years since the company went into liquidation for some return from their policies? In view of the Treasurer's assurance to me last year that a first dividend would be paid as soon as the High Court approved of it, is he in a position to say when approval of the court is likely to be forthcoming and how long it is likely to be after the approval of the court is received before these unfortunate policy-holders receive a payment on their policies? </para>

                            <para>- As I was saying, this is not a matter only of privilege or of social status, as some people would imagine. Particularly is that so in the Royal Australian Air Force, where the relationship between officers and airmen, as I have often observed myself, is an easy and natural one very much in accord with the democratic attitude so characteristic of Australian life. However, what is required of the young air crew officer is not only that he shall be technically proficient to a high degree but also that he shall be able to exercise leadership and authority, not only in the air, but in the course of his duties on the ground as well. I am happy to say that the numbers and the quality of the young Australians who are offering to enter the Air Force at the present time are such that we do not contemplate any difficulty in finding enough young men capable of reaching the standards to which I have referred, and I hope that, before very long, we shall be able to introduce this new scheme under which all the pilots and navigators of the Air Force will in future graduate from their flying schools as officers. </para>

                        <para>- I welcome the question asked by the honorable member for Lang because it gives me an opportunity to say that the public seems to have overlooked the importance of the fact that, for the first time in the history of our country, we are paying child endowment on some  3,030,000  children. That is, to me, one of the most exciting features of our modern society. It means that about one-third of our community is less than sixteen years of age, and it gives degrees of hope for the future that no other country can enjoy. I assure the honorable member for Lang that the question of child endowment payments will be considered, as they always have been considered, in conjunction with all other social service payments. He can rest assured that the Government will do all that lies within its power to equate child endowment payments and other social service benefits with the circumstances of the moment. </para>

                        <para>- I address my question to the  Deputy  Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for Trade. Production of certain primary products, particularly dairy products, has been adversely affected by rising costs - which have now been added to by the increase in the basic wage - and by a decrease in the prices obtainable on world markets, particularly for butter. Following on representations that I made some considerable time ago, I ask the right honorable gentleman, first, whether anything has been done to assist Australian producers to meet competition from producers in other western countries by providing for different grades of milk products on the eastern markets. I ask the Minister, secondly, whether he can inform the House of the extent to which the drive that he has made in the commercial arena to sell dried milk and other milk products has been successful in taking up the slack caused by the extraordinary development of highly subsidized products amongst our western friends in Europe. </para>

                        <para>- The issue raised by the honorable member is highly important. The Government deals with it by consultation between the Department of Trade, in relation to sales promotion, and the Department of Primary Industry. That department, through the Australian Dairy Produce Board and the dairy industry organizations, negotiates with the industry to see where the emphasis of production should be directed. I can say that, as an outcome of this consultation, there is a complete consciousness, both within governmental circles and within the Australian dairy industry, of the necessity at all times to keep aware of the dairy products that are best able to be sold at a profit, or even at the least loss, to the dairy industry. This has led to a shifting of the emphasis of production, from time to time, from butter and cheese to whole milk products. In trade negotiations we have not relied merely on sales promotion. For instance, as one consequence of the Japanese Trade Agreement we have sold to the Japanese Government during the last year no fewer than 700 tons of powdered milk. I think that is the first sale of powdered milk of any consequence to Japan since the war. </para>

                    <para>May I observe that, in times which the honorable member for New England has reminded us are times of extremely low values- for dairy products in world markets, the policies of the Government have protected the dairy industry from an economic collapse to- an extent that I doubt is recognized by the dairy industry itself, and certainly is not recognized by the general public. Our principal export market is the United Kingdom. My latest advice is that the prices being paid for butter on that market will result in a payment to Australian dairy farmers of ls. 9d. per lb. for their production. The policies of the Government are preserving a payment to the dairy farmers fairly close to 4s. 3d. per lb. That is a dramatic illustration of the success of this Government's stabilization policies for the dairy industry. </para>

The aspiration for equal pay is readily understandable, but the question is much more complex than its advocates usually acknowledge. This is particularly so, when viewed against the background of Australian industrial practice. There is, first, the problem of definition. Equal pay can mean different things to different people. For example - the examples are not exclusive - it can mean that the occupant of a position should receive the same pay regardless of sex, or it can mean that the female should receive the same wage as the male if the work done is of equal value. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Australian situation is unlike that of other countries, in that our wage has two principal components - the basic wage and the secondary wage, commonly described as the margin. In the first 30 years' history of the Commonwealth basic wage, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in making its assessments, emphasized needs and social responsibility. For example, the Harvester judgment of 1907 fixed a wage for the unskilled labourer as the sum meeting the normal needs of an average employee, who had a wife and children. The view taken by the arbitration tribunals has been that the average female worker has fewer needs and social responsibilities than the male. </para>
                    <para>An application by the trade unions for an equal basic wage for males and females was dealt with by the former Commonwealth Arbitration Court in its basie wage inquiry of 1949-50. Previously, the base rate for females had, generally speaking, been 54 per cent, of the male basic wage. The court on that occasion decided it should be 75 per cent. That remains the basic wage for adult female employees coming under Commonwealth tribunals. This percentage is, of course, capable of variation by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, but it is significant that no request for an equal basic wage has been made by the unions in any of their four most recent basic wage applications. Perhaps they have taken the view that the award of an equal basic wage to men and women would involve either a reduction of the existing rate for men, or else an indefinite postponement of an increase which might otherwise have been granted to them. </para>
                    <para>The fact that the principle of capacity of industry to pay is now adopted by the Commonwealth tribunal, as the basis on which the basic wage should be assessed, does not mean that there is no longer any element of needs or social responsibility in the current basic wage. Mr. Justice Foster made this clear as recently as the 1949-50 basic wage inquiry, when, as a member of the court which rejected the claim by the unions for the same basic wage for all adults, he stated: " the male basic wage was a social wage for a man, his wife and his family". The judge added that no claim was made by the unions for a " unit " wage upon which equality of wages could be based, as this might have resulted in a lower male basic wage. Equal pay based on the male basic wage would, he observed, put an intolerable strain on the economy; it was socially preferable, he said, to provide a higher wage for the male because of his social obligations to fiancee, wife and family; the productivity, efficiency and the needs and the responsibilities, and so on, of females were substantially less than those of males; and the redistribution of the wage fund so that young unmarried females would receive very increased spending power would, he believed, disturb the economy in a manner certainly to the disadvantage of the married basic wage worker and his wife and family, and probably the whole community. </para>
                    <para>In September last year, when I received a deputation on this question of equal pay, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monk,</inline> the  president  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, I quoted these pertinent comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster, and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monk</inline> if he would let me have the views of the trade union movement concerning them. That invitation has not been accepted. In most of 'the States, legislation operates either directly or indirectly to prevent the State industrial tribunals from awarding the same basic wage to females as to males. In general, these tribunals have fixed a basic wage ranging from 65 per cent, to 75 per cent, of the male basic wage. </para>
                    <para>The secondary wage, or margin, represents, in the main, the assessment that industrial tribunals make of the value of the skill required to perform the job under review, but other considerations such as responsibility, the care required, the arduousness or risk involved, and the circumstances in which the job is performed, may also enter into the assessment. Generally speaking, the tribunals have approached the assessment of margins for females in the same way as they have for males. They have not been unmindful of the likely effect on male and female employment of the margin prescribed. </para>
                    <para>It is possible, from the decisions of the tribunals, to place in broad categories, the distinctions they have applied to male and female wages. In some cases, females receive the same total wage as males employed in the same classification; in other cases, females receive a percentage of the total wage; in still other cases, females receive the same margin. In some cases, females receive a different margin, though the classification for males bears the same name, and in other cases, the wage or margin is prescribed specifically for a classification in which females only are employed. </para>
                    <para>The International Labour Organization Conference of 1951 adopted Convention No. 100 and Recommendation No. 90, concerning "Equal Remuneration of Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value ". The Australian Government delegates supported the adoption of the recommendation, but abstained on the voting of the convention, on the ground, amongst others, that a convention was not an appropriate instrument in this case. It is to be noted that the convention does not require the application of equal pay. What it requires is that member States should promote and - the following words are quoted because they are often overlooked - " so  faT  as it is consistent with the existing method of determining rates of remuneration " should ensure the application " of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value ". </para>

                    <para>It would be doubly unfortunate, in our view, if one State should act on its own in this matter. I say so, first, because of our firm belief that industrial issues of major significance to the economy should not be subjected to political bargaining and attempts at vote catching. Commonwealth governments, irrespective of political party - and I hope I have the confirmation of the Leader of the Opposition on this point - have consistently followed the course of leaving such issues to he determined by the industrial tribunals. </para>
                    <para>My second reason for saying so is that undesirable economic and industrial repercussions must inevitably result from legislation which can only apply to females working under awards of that State, or otherwise within the jurisdiction of its Parliament. </para>
                    <para>The industrial discontent arising from the differences between the basic wages of the Commonwealth and the States, produced by State legislation, are too recent to require emphasis. Equal pay legislation in one State would present much greater difficulties. Any direct benefits that it provided for some would be at the expense of many. Employment generally in that State would be prejudiced and employment opportunities for its women, in particular, would undoubtedly be reduced. </para>
                    <para>It will he  readily  apparent, even from these brief comments, that the question of female wage rates is highly complex, and the tribunals have found it necessary to make their decisions accord with differing circumstances. It is obviously much too complex a question to permit of some broad determination by any one Parliament I lay on the table the following paper - </para>

                    <para class="block">The statement <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> has been made by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> is of very great im portance. It is quite inconsistent with what he has said on this subject on previous occasions. I shall state the facts regarding the international aspect of the matter. In 1951, at the International Labour Organization conference, the Australian Government delegates neither supported nor opposed the convention for equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value. I pause at that point for a moment to say that I do not suppose that anybody would dispute the universality of the principle that, if work of equal value, by definition, is performed by a woman and a man, their remuneration should be equal. Otherwise, there is discrimination, not on the ground of the work being different, inferior or not the same, but because of sex. That is completely contrary to the notions of the world. It is completely contrary to the platform of the Australian Labour party, not only federally but in every State of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable gentleman's statement contained about fourteen buts, thirteen difficulties and ten statements to the effect that the time was not yet ripe for the introduction of equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. He said that all the States should be agreed on the principle and that the Commonwealth Government should not do anything until all the States agreed, although the convention of the I.L.O. is one which, in principle at any rate, is a binding convention recognized, I think, by all the western States of Europe except Spain and Portugal. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline> has made a special study of this question, as honorable members know. </para>

                            <para>- Never mind about that. We do not need to argue how you apply it. Every one knows that the court is needed to work out how it is to be applied in particular industries. But if you accept the principle of equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value, there is no need to worry about the application of the principle; the tribunals will do that. The application will be done in a just way. The New South Wales Government has adopted the principle, and the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cahill,</inline> said its application would have to be worked out according to circumstances in the various industries. The right honorable gentleman is not asked to work out the application of the principle to-day. He is asked to confirm the principle. </para>

                    <para>I have never seen such a statement as that which has been presented to-day by "the right honorable gentleman. It gives every possible reason against doing anything in this matter. But before I continue on that line 1 wish to make a few preliminary comments. What happened in 1953 was this: The Government of Victoria had agreed, as stated by the Minister, on 15th October, 1953, to the Commonwealth ratifying the convention, but of course the Victorian Government was different then. It was a Labour government under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cain.</inline> The Minister for Labour and National Service knows that the only reason why the present Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolte,</inline> does not want to do what the New South Wales Government is proposing to do in this matter is that the Government he leads does not believe in the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. In other words, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolte</inline> is twenty years, perhaps 22 years, behind the times. The rest of the world goes by, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolte</inline> does nothing! </para>
                    <para>The only States which had declined to agree to the ratification of the convention in 1953 were South Australia and Western Australia. The matter has been kept alive in this House continuously by the honorable member for Werriwa. On 5th May this year, he was told by the Minister for Labour and National Service that, in 1953, New South Wales had agreed to the ratification of the convention by the Commonwealth. He also stated that 24 countries had ratified the convention, including every country in Europe except the Iberian and the Scandinavian countries. So public opinion of the world demands equal pay for men and women for equal work. How long is this delay to go on? Even in Australia, there has been something in the nature of a complete industrial change, amounting almost to a revolutionary change, compared with the bad old days when the sweat shops were characteristic of many manufacturing concerns in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Just a moment. We could have lots of interesting discussions on this matter, but I want to finish some observations on a specific principle. Do not try to direct to me a question that the court will ask counsel when the tribunal is working out how to apply this principle. Because this principle will be adopted! It is part of the Australian Labour party's platform and no difficulties or delays will stop its adoption. The Minister has said, in effect, " We cannot do anything until we do everything. Until all the States agree, the Commonwealth can do nothing ". The Commonwealth should be eager to ratify this international convention and induce all the States to carry it out. </para>

                    <para>Let us examine the Minister's statement closely. Tt is a perfect example of a statement which is intended to say, " There are so many difficulties, for heaven's sake let us drop the matter altogether". I admit that there are difficulties in the application of the principle, hut as to the principle itself there is no difficulty whatever. </para>
                    <para>I remind honorable members of the extraordinary change that occurred in the industrial life of Australia when, in the exigencies of the second world war, women had to be employed in various industries to save Australia's industrial development. The Labour government of that day introduced women's employment regulations. The tribunal to administer it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster. Instead of the percentage of remuneration for women's work, compared to the remuneration paid to men, being something in the low 50's, it went up to 70 or 74 per cent. That was bitterly opposed, even in time of war* by the conservative forces of this country led by the </para>
                    <para class="block">Opposition to the Labour government, especially in the Senate. Our opponents in  that  chamber disallowed the regulations. They would not have regulations which were essential to the efficient government of this country in respect of the remuneration for women. </para>
                    <para>The Labour government of the day had to take up the challenge of the Senate and brought down legislation in this House for that purpose. The Senate was going to reject it, but had second thoughts, and the bill was passed. That was a tremendous advance, but it was only a step on the march towards the adoption of the principle. I think I can sum up the Minister's statement by saying that his contention was that this question is obviously too complex to permit of a broad determination by one particular parliament. Stated that way the proposition probably could not be challenged. The question is complex because industry has multifarious and innumerable ramifications. The principle could not be applied in some automatic way. The industrial commission or some special tribunal is needed to apply it. Of course it is most desirable that it should be done on a Commonwealth-wide basis. That is the objective of this party. We do not want one State only to do it. It is necessary and it is a social demand. It is a shocking thing to find this Government just saying, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolte</inline> does not want it; therefore, nothing is to be done ". Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolte</inline> does not want it. </para>

That is why the New South Wales Parliament established the 40-hour week. There would not have been a 40-hour week in this country but for the lead given by that Parliament, and the Parliaments of Queensland and Victoria. That lead was given by Labour governments. This Government would have said, " No. We will wait until the court does it ". We can see how long we would have had to wait. It all depends on the circumstances. There are principles of such a character that they should be universally observed. They do not admit of dispute before an arbitration court. I hope that honorable members understand exactly what I mean. </para>

                            <para>- The only interjections are coming from the Minister, who does not like this matter to be dealt with so directly. Without going into every sentence of this statement, I say that it is, in effect, a repudiation of the principle. The attitude is that there are so many difficulties in the way of getting started that we had better not try. The Government does not believe in the principle, and that is the truth. The big business interests of this country do not want the principle of equal pay between the sexes for work of equal value. They want women's wages to be kept down. They use the old argument that if women were awarded a higher wage they would not be employed. Women will be employed because they are skilled and are needed in industry. The argument used by big business interests is just one of the old shibboleths. It was used to try to defeat the 40-hour week, workers' compensation, and every other reform and improvement in conditions. </para>

Instead of being in the forefront in demanding reform and working out the details, as it could, with  a  special or general tribunal, or the Commonwealth arbitration tribunal, the Government has produced a document which, in my opinion, shows that it does not really mean to do anything in this matter. The Government says, " Let this thing lie ". That is what it comes to. </para>

In answer to a question, I said that the return to dairy farmers this year under the stabilization plan would be 4s. 3d. per lb. That is correct. That is the guaranteed return. But a colleague has pointed out to me that, as is well known in the dairying industry, the actual return to dairy farmers is a figure representing the average of the guaranteed proportion of production and the unguaranteed proportion. The present estimate of the average return to dairy farmers is 43d. per lb. I desire to make sure that there is no ambiguity. </para>

                    <para class="block">By this bill the Government proposes to amend section 10 of the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1957. That act is administered by the Minister for National Development, and this bill, as the House has heard, was introduced in the Senate. </para>
                    <para>The act authorizes the Minister to make agreements to subsidize the cost of drilling for stratigraphic information useful in the search for oil. The announcement of the Government's intention to subsidize the cost of drilling these holes was made by the Treasurer on 3rd September last year, and the act came into operation on 12th December last. Section 10 of the act deals with cases where drilling operations began after the Treasurer's announcement but before the act came into operation. </para>
                    <para class="block">Section 10 provides that, where a drilling operation was begun between those two dates an application may be made, and an agreement may be entered into, for the payment of the subsidy, either before the drilling operation is completed, or before the expiration of three months after the act came into operation, whichever date is the earlier. </para>
                    <para>In the drilling programme for the period, up to 30th June of this year, there is only one company which is affected by this particular section. It is the Australasian Petroleum Company, which is now engaged in an approved drilling operation at Puri in Papua. This is one of four holes which the company is now drilling in Papua, but the Puri hole is the only one of the four which is primarily intended to obtain stratigraphic information and therefore is the only one which comes within the ambit of the act and qualifies for subsidy. The search for oil is extremely costly, and the estimated cost of the Puri hole alone is nearly Â£1,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The Puri hole was begun after the Treasurer's announcement but before the act came into operation. It therefore comes within, the provisions of section 10. The Australasian Petroleum Company applied promptly and did all required of it, but the time permitted by the section proved inadequate for the negotiations necessary before the agreement could be completed. The issues involved were complex, and the Department of National Development found that the matter took longer than could- have been expected when the act was drafted. The Minister was therefore unable to complete the agreement with the company within- three months. In the meantime the drilling at Puri is continuing, and' :he company is supplying information to the Department of National Development. To enable the Government to pay the subsidy, on which the company was clearly entitled to rely, this amendment of the act is required. </para>
                    <para>No other point is involved. The bill proposes only to amend the act to remove the restriction on the time within which the Minister may complete an agreement contemplated by the section. This will be done by removing from section 10(l.)(b) all references to the agreement for payment of subsidy, and the Minister will thus be able, to enter into an agreement with the. Australasian Petroleum Company. </para>
                    <para>I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that of all the measures that have passed through this Parliament during the fifteen years in which I have been associated with it, this bill is the most important. I believe, also, that the Snowy Mountains scheme, with which the bill deals, is one of the greatest achievements in the history of Australia. If one studies the tremendous engineering feats that have been performed since the commencement of the scheme, one finds that certain works that have been carried out are recognized as the greatest of their kind ever undertaken in any part of the world. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I want to say at the outset, without attempting to achieve any party political gain; that it must be a matter of great pride for the Australian Labour party to realize the very great part that a Labour government played in the inauguration of this great national scheme. I believe that as the years go by, the scheme will stand as a monument to the great vision of a Labour government. </para>
                    <para>One may ask to-day what prompted the Labour government in 1949 to initiate this scheme. The Labour Government was prompted by the following considerations. First, we had been through the disastrous World War II., and the Government realized that if Australia was to be defended certain things had to be done. During the war we reached the stage when we called for the last ounce of effort from our working force. We called on almost every individual in the country to do his best to make it possible, for us to bring the. war to a successful conclusion. One of the lessons that the. Labour Government learned" during the. war was that if we were to defend this country in the future we would have to increase our population by bringing a. great number of people here from overseas countries. We realized that if we increased our population in this way we would have to feed the extra, people and find employment for them. </para>
                    <para>The Labour Government of those days gave an undertaking to all those who had participated in World War II., and to the Australian community generally, that we would ensure full employment for all our people. We envisaged a population increase of some millions, and we had to find ways and means of feeding and employing the increased population. As one method of overcoming these difficulties, we inaugurated' the great Snowy Mountains scheme. I look back with a great deal of pride to a sunny afternoon in&gt; November, 1949, when, as a Labour Cabinet Minister, I attended the turning of the- first sod in- one of the most picturesque parts of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> felt most gratified that Australia, through the efforts of a Labour government^ was about to commence one of the greatest engineering schemes in the history of the world. This was something which was very much needed in this country. We promised the Australian people that they would be given full employment and this scheme was practical evidence of that assurance. It was also the start of the fulfilment of a promise that irrigation schemes would be established to use the surplus water from the Snowy in many areas through which it flowed and thus give greater impetus to primary industries. Secondary industries also had the prospects of new supplies of essential electric power from this scheme. The Labour Government realized what a tremendous advance this extra power from the great Snowy scheme would make in secondary industries. </para>
                    <para>Australia is a vast country, but its development has suffered great drawbacks through the periodical recurrence of tragic droughts. During rainy seasons the few large rivers have carried millions of gallons of water out to sea, whereas if this could have been conserved many severe losses from drought could have been averted. I vividly recall a sight which made me realize the great value of irrigation to Australia. Many years ago, I visited the Deniliquin district of New South Wales just after the irrigation scheme had been established there. I stood at a wire fence on the boundary of a property at a spot where the irrigation channel finished. On one side of the fence was lucerne three feet high, in spite of the fact that a drought was upon the land. About 200 or 300 yards beyond the place where the irrigation channel ended stock were dying of hunger and thirst. I am confident that this great Snowy scheme will play a tremendous part in the further development of Australia because of the assistance it will give to irrigation. </para>
                    <para>I am sure that this House will pass this measure, but I regret that there seems to be a lack of understanding concerning the position of South Australia. The Government does not seem to understand or want to admit that the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is prompted by a genuine desire to make this bill a perfect piece of legislation. One Government member said that the Prime Minister had made it quite clear that South Australia had nothing to fear from the Snowy Mountains Agreement. But if one reads the report of the speech which he delivered in this House on Tuesday evening, one will find that certain fears were expressed by him. That being so, is it not only logical that members of the Opposition, who were Ministers in or supporters of the Labour Government when this scheme was first commenced, should be as keen now as they and their colleagues were in November, 1945, that this scheme shall operate to the advantage of every State of the Commonwealth and benefit Australia as a nation? We want the people and the industries, both primary and secondary, to obtain the full benefit of this scheme. </para>
                    <para>If there is any doubt in the minds of members of the Opposition or of members on the Government side, let us clear it up. That doubt can be cleared up by the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

I was amazed to hear varying views expressed by members on the Government side. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forbes)</inline> criticized the Labour party because its spokesman in the Senate moved an amendment to this bill. He pointed out that after that amendment was defeated, Labour senators voted for the third reading of the bill. I think the honorable member was playing politics and I do not think the honorable member believes that any stable Opposition would vote against a measure of such importance to the nation merely because its amendment was defeated. </para>

Members of this Parliament would not think much of me if, because of certain actions or statements for which I was responsible, I ran away from political thoughts and beliefs of a lifetime. I feel that I can speak for the Opposition, every member of which is keen to-day to see that the scheme for which a Labour government was responsible, and in respect of which it brought legislation into this </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, is carried to completion. It is a scheme which has evoked the interest and admiration of the whole world. I do not believe that the people who say that Labour governments cannot govern are honest or serious. Of all the achievements of the National Parliament, the Snowy scheme will go down in history as one of the greatest. As the years go by, the Australian people will look on the scheme with a great deal of pride and pleasure, knowing that it was a Labour government which set Australia on the journey towards greater development by initiating a scheme to use the waters of these rivers to irrigate great areas and to enable more food to be produced for the Australian people, and for people in other parts of the world, as well as to produce the power needed to give employment to millions of people in Australia's secondary industries. </para>
                    <para>This scheme is the admiration of the world - the greatest scheme that has ever been embodied in legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament. When I leave this Parliament, I shall be able to look back with a great deal of pride and pleasure, knowing that a Labour government with which I was associated placed on the statute-book the measure to initiate a scheme which will stand, in years to come, as a monument to the work, desires and dreams of the great Australian Labour party. I trust that there will be no party politics in this matter. T trust that the Government will believe that this amendment has been moved in all sincerity, and that the desire of the Opposition is to make sure that the great Snowy Mountains scheme will go down in history as the unanimous work of this Parliament. Tn the closing months of this Parliament I hope that we shall all come together so that we shall be able to say that we all played our part in putting through the legislation for a great national scheme. </para>

                        <para>. - This Snowy scheme is a developing scheme. As the investigations in the field proceed, the form of the scheme changes. The scheme grows and becomes, I think, better. The scheme that we have to-day is not the scheme that we had in 1955, 1950, or 1949. I am certain that in 1965 the scheme, as it will have been developed then, will be even better than the present scheme. As I said, it is a developing scheme. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I think that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> and the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers),</inline> in their speeches, have been a little ungenerous to their predecessors. The Snowy scheme has been talked about for a long time. It was first seriously considered by the Stevens-Bruxner Government of New South Wales, under the Rendall Palmer and Trilton report. The scheme that was put forward then was not the scheme that was adopted. It was not as good as the scheme that was adopted, but it was the kernel and genesis of the whole thing- It is a little ungenerous of people not to recognize that. We on this side of the House recognize the work done by a previous administration. Do not let us try to hog all the credit. Now that I have made that point, let me admit that perhaps I myself have been a little hard on the honorable member for Adelaide. </para>
                    <para>I want to turn to the bill before the House. This scheme, as it has developed, is mainly an electricity scheme, but the debate has been mainly with regard to water. I think that is not unreasonable, because although the scheme is, financially, an electricity scheme - the whole of the cost will be recovered from the users of electricity - the water aspect, from the long term point of view, may turn out to be the most important. I feel that the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> was a little astray in an interjection that he made to-day when he said that all the taxpayers of Australia were paying for this scheme. Ultimately, the scheme will be paid for by the users of electricity in New South Wales and Victoria. [Quorum formed.] I do not think that that will inflict any hardship on them, because the electricity will be provided at an economic rate. It must be remembered that it will be peak power, which normally costs more to generate than base load power. </para>
                    <para>Let me come to the question of the development of the scheme. One thing that has arisen recently is the possibility of using pumps to raise water a little way in order to drop it. through the system, a much greater distance, thus making a net gain in power. That system has been developed primarily, I think, as a result of experience in Austria. Modern pumps have a mechanical efficiency approaching 85 per cent. </para>
                    <para class="block">That means that if water can be raised 400 or 500 feet, be stored in a dam such as the Adaminaby Dam, and eventually be dropped 3,500 feet to the ultimate outlets of the power station, there will be a considerable gain in power. This fact may enable the scheme to be advantageously re-designed. It may be important from the water point of view also because it will enable storage to be maintained at a higher level than would otherwise be the case. It will make them more valuable as regulators of the waters that will ultimately flow into the Murray and Murrumbidgee as a result of the scheme. </para>
                    <para>Let me now deal with the water aspect. I agree entirely with the contention of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that neither over the short term nor over the long term will the interests of South Australia in any way be prejudiced or damaged by this agreement. I agree also that since this water is vital to South Australia, those interests should not be prejudiced or damaged. Over the long term South Australia will stand to benefit immensely by the regulatory functions of the works that are being constructed on the upper Murray and Murrumbidgee catchments. Over the short term it will not be prejudiced in any way at all. because the water coming from the Tooma into the Murrumbidgee will not be in any way deducted at any time from South Australia's share. We have rather tended to get away from the main point at issue and to take a narrow rather than a broad view. Let us look at this as a construction scheme. Let us look at the flow of water in the Murray as a whole. Figures are available showing the flow of the Murray below its junction with the Darling. I quote from the " Short History of the River Murray Works ", the official history by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eaton,</inline> which states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The average flow of the Murray River below its junction with the Darling River between 1891 and 1911 . . . was 9,328,000 acre feet per calendar year. The maximum discharge recorded since 1891 was 29,350,000 acre feet in 1917 . . and the minimum flow in drought years was only 2,329,000 acre feet in 1902 and 1,894,000 acre feet in 1914. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The figures cover the period from 1891 to 1914. I have taken out figures from various- official sources showing in detail the amount of water in acre feet entering South Australia each year. Under clause 49 of the River Murray Agreement, South </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia is entitled to 1,250,000 acre feet a year. On looking back to 1891, which is as far as the records go, I find that in only three years  -  1902-03, 1914-15, and 1944-45  -  has the actual flow into South Australia been less than 1,250,000 acre feet. We can say fairly certainly - in fact I would say absolutely certainly - that after the completion of the regulatory works and reservoirs that are being constructed, South Australia will never get less than the maximum to which it is entitled under the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Let us look at storages constructed and projected. First of all there is, of course, the Hume weir, which has now been increased to 2,500,000 acre feet. Then there is the Adaminaby dam, or Lake Eucumbene as it is to be called, which will have a live storage of 3,500,000 acre feet. Burrinjuck dam has a live storage of a little more than 800,000 acre feet, and Lake Victoria which, honorable members are aware, is near the border of New South Wales and South Australia, has an effective storage of about 500,000 acre feet. Those figures total 7,300,000 acre feet. This storage, most of which is new, and the flow as revealed by the figures from 1891 onwards, will ensure that South Australia will always get its maximum share. The criticism of the scheme by honorable members opposite is, therefore, rather unreal and not related to the facts of life. </para>
                    <para>There are some projected storages which will further improve the position, particularly the storage at the Menindee Lakes on the Darling a couple of miles above its junction with the Murray. A projected storage dam of 2,000,000 acre feet will be constructed there. When that is done the flow of the Darling into the Murray will not be less than 400,000 acre feet even in a bad and dry year. It will not fail below that figure when the Menindee Lakes storage is constructed. Then we have a very important projected dam at Blowering, just above Tumut, of a little less than 1,000,000 acre feet. That dam is important not so much for the amount of water it will store, as for the fact that it will lie below the tail-races of the mam power houses on the Tumut system and it will therefore enable those power houses to be operated to the greatest advantage for the production of electricity without prejudicing the use of the water lower down the river, and without in any way prejudicing the interests either of South Australia or of the people who take from that system. </para>

                    <para>There is also the early possibility of a 1,250,000 acre feet dam at Billilingera, which will further regulate the waters of the Murrumbidgee. Looking at this as a whole, we can see that 11,500,000 or 12,000,000 acre feet of storage will be provided in this system. Having regard to the known flow in the Murray since 1891, which is as far back as the records go, it will be seen that at most the provisions of not more than an additional 500,000 acre feet a year is needed to give South Australia its full quota under clause 49 of the agreement. Furthermore, our records show that two bad years have never occurred consecutively. Also, even when a bad year is experienced on the Murray catchment, it is exceedingly unlikely that it will coincide with a bad year on the Darling catchment, which is subject to quite a different set of weather conditions. </para>
                    <para>For those reasons I find the argument that South Australia's interests will be prejudiced somewhat academic. I believe that this bill is very much in the interests of South Australia, because it will save that State from the ill effects of the occasional year when the flow of the Murray falls below the stipulated minimum required for South Australia. </para>
                    <para>Let me look for a moment at the use that is made of this water at present. In round figures New South Wales uses 500,000 acre feet a year from the Murray and 500,000 acre feet a year from the Murrumbidgee systems - about 1,000,000 acre feet a year in all. Victoria uses about 1,000,000 acre feet a year from the Murray system. South Australia draws only 200,000 acre feet a year from the Murray system below its entry into that State. South Australia needs the water, not for use so much as to reduce salinity in the river system. The major part of that water is being used to flush out the salt which seeps into the river from the adjoining country when the level of the water is low, and, incidentally, that water may be necessary in order to sweeten the country and prevent the salting up of the land with the rising of the water table. So this -water may be very necessary for South Australia, but it is not being used for irrigation; it is being used  for  flushing purposes in -order to keep the salinity in the river below a certain level. </para>
                    <para>I shall not go into details, but I believe that, with the .provision of storage higher up on the Murray, it will be possible to change, to some extent, South Australian practices economically on that river so as to keep the salinity down and, at the same time, allow a greater amount of water to be drawn off for irrigation and other use. That could, I think, <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> done by certain locking works which would differentially raise the level of the river in times of drought. But T shall not .go into those matters, which are technical. I believe that there is a possibility of great economy in .the use of water inside the .borders of South Australia. But, of course, it is not only South Australia that is prodigal with this water. Evaporation losses in the upper part of the river between Victoria and New South Wales are very .great. I am told that losses from evaporation and percolation between Albury and the South Australian border are of the order of 500,000 acre feet a year. Perhaps this is an inescapable minirnum. </para>
                    <para>In Victoria and New South Wales, obstructions in the channels caused by the growth of river reeds, which, J think, are called cumbungi locally, have very greatly increased the .transpiration rate and made for a much less effective use of the available water. I think that this is a problem with respect to which the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, by the expenditure of a little capital on research, might well do as much as would be done by the expenditure of many millions of pounds of capital on additional dams further up the river, by .enabling us to make better use of the existing water by decreasing .transpiration and other uneconomic Josses. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme 5s likely not only to develop but also to grow. We hope that it will both develop and grow. We can see that new techniques will enable us to increase economically the amount of power and water available from the system, to make better use of the water which becomes available, and, furthermore, with the construction of these great regulator}' works at the head of the Murray River, to make certain that the awkward periods of droughts do not materially affect the river flow available for the vital irrigation and other works along its course. </para>
                    <para>Let us turn our attention from the smaller works and look at this magnificent scheme as the great and developing asset which it can .be. Let us try to co-ordinate the river Murray works and the works of the Snowy Mountains scheme with wider irrigation works in the whole of the Murray system. It seems to me, for example - and I am indebted to -am interjector from the Government ranks who reminded me of this - that -the Menindee Lakes scheme must be considered a vital part of the Murray scheme, because it will affect water supply right down the lower reaches of the Murray - and even further up - for various reasons which I have not time to go into now- We have to remember that some of the best land in Australia lies along the Darling River from Menindee down to its confluence with the Murray at Wentworth. That loose red soil which lies particularly on the eastern bank of the Darling is some of the 'best land available in the whole of Australia for irrigation. </para>
                    <para>J know that the authorities interested in other river systems may look on the Snowy scheme with a certain amount of jealousy as the scheme which is absorbing the funds that might be made available for expenditure elsewhere. I do not pretend to know very much about this matter in detail, and I certainly do not pretend to know very much about systems outside New South Wales, but I do know that there are, on the north coast of New South Wales, river systems which merit the closest investigation and the same kind of sympathetic interest in development that has been evident in the Snowy scheme. We must do one thing at a time. Let that be agreed. We must not waste our substance on uncompleted works all over -the country- That, of course, is one of the cardinal sins of the present New </para>
                    <para class="block">South Wales Government. But, apart from the Snowy scheme, certainly in New South Wales, and, 1 believe, in other parts of Australia also, similar schemes could go forward with equal advantage to our country. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this bill. With other honorable members, I regard this scheme as one of the greatest that we have ever had. I was present at the opening and I have been through the area on several occasions since. I have been very pleased with the way the present Government has continued the work that was commenced by the Chifley Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The idea of the scheme is to take the water flowing east of the Great Dividing Range, through country that has a very heavy rainfall, into the Tasman Sea, and turn it to the western side of the range. This is being done by the construction of huge tunnels up to 30 miles long and over 1,000 feet below the tops of the mountains. The water will then flow into the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. On the way down, it will be used to operate power stations and a tremendous amount of additional power will be available for New South Wales and Victoria. I do not want to dwell on the details of the scheme, because they have been mentioned by other honorable members. I was present at the opening of the Guthega power house. This power house provides an additional 60,000 kilowatts of electricity for New South Wales. The new power house, T.l, will give a further tremendous increase in the amount of power available. Those who conceived this scheme and those who are carrying it out have wonderful minds and a deep knowledge of engineering. The vast chamber to accommodate the T.l power station at Tumut Ponds demonstrates their ability. This power station will be 1,000 feet under a mountain, away from bombing and other dangers. </para>
                    <para>The water which formerly ran into the Tasman Sea and is now being turned into the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers, will be of immense value. The States should be pleased that this water will cost them nothing. The sale of power generated by the scheme will meet the cost of storing; the water and making it available. New South Wales and Victoria will obtain thebenefit of the water, and I should say that New South Wales will certainly receive the greatest benefit. The waters from the Snowy scheme will be used to increase production in areas at the back of Leeton, Griffith and Narrandera. Some years ago,, we regularly came by a DC3 aeroplane - the milk run, as we called it - from Adelaide to Canberra. We landed at Mildura, amidst the wonderful production there, and" at Hay, where the Murrumbidgee River was being used for irrigation purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in the Riverina. From Hay, we would go to Narrandera and Griffith, and we would see the amazing transformation of the land there. Flying along for 200 or 300 miles, we would see immense areas of land suitable to produce crops such as are produced at Griffith and Narrandera. All that was needed was water, and the only way to get that water was to have a scheme such as the Snowy scheme to gather it when it was available in the wet seasons or the snow seasons, so that it could be distributed when it was needed. The cost would have been too great, if it had to be borne by irrigation alone. However, by using the scheme to generate power, the water can be made available without cost. The Blowering Dam and irrigation works will be built by the New South Wales Government, but the real storage of the water, so that it can be made available just like turning on a tap when it is needed, must be done in the great valleys of the Snowy Mountains. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>The thought of this water being made available is very pleasing to me. As a young man on the land, I had a river flowing past my home. We would see it come up almost to the level of the road, but we could not get it on to the paddocks where it was badly needed. It was heartbreaking to see the level of the river fall without good use having been made of the water. Having had that experience in my younger days, I have a full appreciation of what can be done by irrigation. Undoubtedly, the storage of water in the Snowy scheme will be a wonderful benefit. A big storage area is available at Burrinjuck, but, even when it is filled, it does not hold enough to provide irrigation for vast areas of land in addition to the land already irrigated by it. However, the storage in the Snowy will enable the additional areas to be irrigated. </para>
                    <para>When this scheme was first introduced, I did not visualize one thing. It was introduced during the life of the Chifley Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson</inline> Lemmon, who was then the Minister responsible for it. I was here at the time and heard the debate on the scheme. I stated at that time that, although South Australia was not likely to get very much benefit from the scheme, I thought that South Australia would get some benefit from the additional water flowing down the western side of the Great Dividing Range. South Australia, of course, would not receive any benefit from the power generated in the scheme. I did not appreciate that, instead of merely taking the water from the eastern side of the mountains and putting it on the western side, water already flowing on the western side in the Tooma River, which is a tributary of the Murray, would be diverted into the Murrumbidgee River. That water was not water flowing down the eastern side into the Tasman Sea; it was water flowing into the Murray River. </para>
                    <para>At this stage, South Australia must be satisfied that it will have sufficient water in the future. It has been said that we have no need to worry, that we are entitled in dry periods to three-thirteenths of the water in the Murray at Albury. However, I do not know whether honorable members appreciate that it is not only the waters that come down the Murray above Albury that help to fill Lake Victoria; there is also the water that comes from the western side of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. When people go to Seymour and see the Goulburn River, I do not think that they realize that the natural flow of that river is through Victoria, and that much of it finds its way into the Murray and is available at Goolwa, in South Australia. </para>
                    <para>In Victoria, there are great hydro-electric schemes. I am very pleased to see the Victorians undertaking such schemes, storing large quantities of water, and extending their irrigation areas. At the end of this week I shall be driving through some of those areas on my way home. When I am passing through Benalla and Sheppar ton I shall see the great new channel on the edge of the irrigation area at Shepparton, the purpose of which is to provide more irrigation, and rightly so. But I suggest that the more irrigation there is at Shepparton, and in Victoria generally, the greater will be the consumption of water that otherwise would be going into the Murray. Therefore, I sometimes wonder whether, instead of dwelling too much on the importance of the Snowy Mountains scheme, we should not be giving serious consideration to the fact that the development of this scheme will result in depletion of the supplies of Murray water going to South Australia. </para>
                    <para>In saying that, I do not question at al! the wisdom of what Victoria is doing. On the contrary, I pat the Victorians on the back, as it were, for making good use of the water that is available. But when one considers the position of South Australia, and particularly of its irrigated areas, one cannot help but be somewhat concerned. </para>

                            <para>-  The Minister says that the River Murray Agreement protects us, but I point out that the protection applies only when there is water coming down the Murray to fill Lake Victoria. There is no difficulty when there is a big flow of water coming down the Murray, but when the river is only two or three feet deep the position is altogether different. If the waters of the Murray are to be used to generate electricity through the turbines and to irrigate land on the way down from the Snowy Mountains, I wonder whether there will be the volume that we in South Australia need. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>I think that that doubt is behind all the strong feeling - let me put it that way - that has arisen in South Australia, on the part not only of the Premier and South Australian members of the Liberal party in this House, but also of the people. Those who live in the Murray valley and are dependent on water from the Murray for irrigation purposes, want to be assured that there will be sufficient water. They are looking not just one or two years ahead, but to a considerable time ahead. Only three or four years ago, the irrigation area at Loxton was extended, and many returned servicemen were settled on fruit-growing blocks which required water for irrigation. That area has developed wonderfully. There are also irrigation areas at Renmark, Berri and Barmera. Those are wonderfully productive areas, too: The more we plan to develop irrigation areas, the more certain we must be that sufficient water will be coming down the Murray. In addition to that, another aspect is of importance in this respect. I point out to honorable members that those living in irrigation areas are not the only people in South Australia who are concerned with the water that comes down the Murray. The people in the metropolitan area of Adelaide also are concerned. </para>
                    <para>At present, more than 90 per cent, of the water that is used in factories, and for domestic purposes generally, in the Adelaide metropolitan area comes from the Murray - from Mannum, over the mountains and down to Adelaide. All the water that comes down now is needed for present requirements. At the time that it was decided to construct the pipeline, from Mannum to Adelaide, I. thought that those responsible for the decision were looking a little too far ahead, but I am now convinced that they were very wise in deciding to do so. No sooner had the pumps been installed and started to pump water than our reservoirs became practically empty. Since the erection of that pipeline we have had no water restrictions. At great cost, we have been able to pump sufficient water, but, as I say, the work was completed just in time to save us serious disaster. For the last twelve months there has been practically no rain in the catchment areas of the reservoirs to supply Adelaide and its. suburbs. Nearly all the water that has gone into the reservoirs has come from the Murray River. Honorable members will therefore appreciate the concern of the people of Adelaide, as well as those in irrigation areas in the Murray valley, with the need to maintain a sufficient flow in the Murray. So far, we have not had a drought which has affected the flow of the river, although we have had dry years. </para>
                    <para>Before Adelaide received water from the Murray for domestic, use, we had to use sub-artesian bore water. As soon as that water was pumped into the mains, difficulties occurred.. The very next day, 1 had to call on an electrician to come and attend to my bath heater; because the saline content of the water was so great that it blew the fuse of the heater. When supplies began to come from the Murray, the South Australian Minister for Public Works said to me, "You will never have any more bother with your bath heater. The Murray water is so fresh that you will not have the trouble that you had with the bore water." About four months later I said to the Minister, " Have you started using artesian bore water again? " He replied, "No, we are using only Murray water". I said, "Well, the fuse of my bath heater has blown again. I can see what is happening. The Murray water is getting salty, too." Shortly afterwards, a statement appeared in the press that the water, in passing through swamps which were impregnated with salt, acquired a salt content. Honorable members therefore will appreciate that, although there has not been a drought period, as such, in recent times so far as the Murray has- been concerned, the flow on occasion has been so low that the quality of the water has been affected. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> stated in the House recently that it never had been necessary to invoke the provisions of the River Murray Agreement. I hope that we shall never have to invoke them. I want to ensure that South Australia always will have sufficient water. When the Prime Minister was speaking, he said that some of the water would go into the Swampy Plains River and then into the Murray, and thus help to provide additional- water for South Australia. I interjected at the time; and- the right honorable gentleman agreed, that that suggestion involved a time factor. I think that it is in this respect that the Premier of South Australia made the- strongest point in his criticism. The Premier has. claimed that, by taking water from the Tooma and putting it into the Tumut long before water was put into the Murray from, the Snowy, South Australia would be prejudiced. The water will go through the power stations. Then it will go. into the Blowering, dam. thence to Burrinjuck and into the Murrumbidgee. The water will not go into the Murray River until it is used, up there. Unless the- people of South Australia are completely satisfied that no danger will arise to them, they will continue to, be concerned about the flow of that water. </para>
                    <para>I do not want to question the correctness of statements that were made by the Prime Minister, but -I should like to refer to some of them. He said there had been a meeting of the commissioners in connexion with the River Murray Agreement. I regret very much that he could not see his way clear to tell this -Parliament the result of that meeting. The right honorable gentleman said that until the information had been made available to the States concerned - Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia - it would not be right for him to make it available to us. I regret that he has not been prepared to inform honorable members of the decisions that were reached. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that the River Murray Waters Act is .to be amended, and the right honorable gentleman referred to a section which would have to be altered, but he also said that probably there would have to be other alterations to the River Murray Agreement. We in South Australia want to know more definitely what those alterations are to be and whether they will clear any doubts in our minds about our rights to the waters of the river Murray. </para>
                    <para>Claims to water rights have caused bloodshed in many lands. When pioneers were advancing through the western States of the United States of America and taking up land, arguments frequently arose about water rights. Some settlers would dynamite a bank and divert water to their property. Others would dam a river and cut off the water supply from others. Such actions led to bloodshed. One who had a river running through his property would claim that he had the right to use the waters of that river. Another would say that nobody had a right to erect a dam and so prevent him from getting water. These difficulties are not new. </para>
                    <para>The River Murray Agreement was framed partly to decide the rights of each State to the waters of that river. It was made many years ago by three States and the Commonwealth for the purpose of sharing the water. South Australia depends on that agreement for its share of the waters of the Murray. It was an essential agreement. Before locks were built along the river, an estimate had to be made of the demands that would be received for water for the irrigation settlements. There is no worry about the water in flood-time, but at other times it is essential that the irrigation blocks have enough water for their needs. A decision had to be reached about the area of land adjacent to the river Murray which could be served for irrigation. The people of South Australia want to be sure that sufficient water will continue to flow in the Murray to them. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> and other supporters of the Government have stated that if an amendment had not been adopted in the Senate, they would have opposed the bill. The amendment provides that the River Murray Agreement is not to be affected by this measure. That might appear to be satisfactory and I hope that the position will be met by the amendment, but I have always felt that this was the Snowy Mountains scheme, primarily a great national scheme, as well as one to benefit New South Wales and Victoria and, incidentally, South Australia. I thought that the government of each State would make sure that the rights of all parties would be met honorably and fairly. Even now, while we may disagree with the security that is offered by this agreement, I do not question for one moment that New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth believed that it would not be unfair to anybody else. I support the bill, but emphasize that the Opposition asks for acceptance of the amendment that will be moved at the committee stage. The amendment is designed to alter clause 2 by adding these words - </para>

                        <para>.- The question of the protection of South Australia has, I think, been fully covered. The amendments of the River Murray Waters Act, to which the last  speaker  referred, are purely additional safeguards. I think that most members on this side of the House, other than South Australians, regard some of the actions of the Premier of South Australia as being in the nature of horsetrading. When any new scheme is born, there are certain debits and credits. In the process of development of the Snowy Mountains scheme, there are some debits. Before the storage and regulating dams are made, additional waters will be flowing down both the Murray River and the lower Tumut River. These waters will be additional to the normal flow and may cause considerable damage to riparian landowners. Provision is made for dealing with this matter in the agreement which has been reached between the Commonwealth and the States of Victoria and New South Wales. Clause 3 of the second schedule provides that the Snowy Mountains Authority shall - </para>

                        <para>In investigating, planning, locating and constructing its works, take reasonable precautions for the prevention of loss by flooding in relation to land along the Upper Murray and Lower Tumut. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The authority is collecting data and making surveys of the river beds to ascertain what damage could possibly occur before the storage dams are constructed. </para>
                    <para>Both of these rivers have been very seriously neglected by the State governments concerned. The Murray, of course, has been neglected by both States, and the Tumut by New South Wales. There is an enormous number of snags on the river. There are areas where simple remedial measures could be taken to stop the formation of new channels. With local people, I went down the Murray, and I know the Tumut fairly well. It is obvious that some beautiful, rich alluvial flats are being damaged and destroyed for want of proper remedial measures. As most people will know, along these rivers are beautiful alluvial flats which are highly productive, but local residents are not developing them to the degree necessary in the national interest, simply because there is no security from flooding. If the rivers were snagged, if reasonable remedial measures were taken where there is a possibility of new channels being formed, I am quite certain that the land-owners would be prepared to expend considerable capital in order to maintain the best class of pasture that the land warrants. </para>
                    <para>In the second schedule protection is being given in relation to that matter. Landowners will be compensated for losses caused by flooding resulting from the additional water from the diverted rivers. To my mind, this is a serious matter. I hope that the data collected by the Snowy Mountains Authority will enable the authority to make adequate plans for dealing with it until the normal storage dams are constructed. An increased flow of water in a river bed can result in damage to certain areas by raising the water table. It is only just that the land-owners should be protected. </para>
                    <para>I do not like the proposition that compensation should be paid. There is always unpleasant litigation and a feeling of uncertainty about being properly compensated. In the national interest, I should prefer that the Snowy Mountains Authority did all the necessary work of snagging, correcting river channels, and taking all other remedial measures to ensure that the minimum amount of compensation will be necessary and that litigation will be reduced to a minimum. I believe that that is a method which would commend itself to the general public. </para>
                    <para>The second point I should like to raise is in relation to the building of the Blowering Dam. There will be a gain to the Tumut-Murrumbidgee system of over 500,000 acre feet per annum as a result of the diversion of the Eucumbene and Tooma rivers, a further 192,000 acre feet by regulation due to storage in the system, and 300,000 acre feet by regulation due to the Blowering Dam. Additional water amounting to over 992,000 acre feet will thus be available to the TumutMurrumbidgee system. One has to allow for a certain amount of evaporation, and it is estimated that the net gain to farms will be 700,000 acre feet- If we allow one foot per acre of irrigated area per annum, about 500,000 acres of country could be irrigated without the construction of the Blowering Dam. If the Blowering Dam is built, another 200,000 acres will be irrigated. The irrigated area will be increased by nearly 40 per cent. These figures are only approximate, because honorable members will appreciate that a great deal depends on the class of primary produce being grown in the newly irrigated area. Some crops require more water than others. But these are formidable figures. The Blowering Dam will give Australian another 200,000 irrigable acres. Its construction is estimated to cost Â£18,000,000. I do not know how long it will take. I imagine that construction by private enterprise would take a comparatively short time, but judging by the work of the New South Wales Government, the construction of the Blowering Dam will extend into the next century. </para>
                    <para>I should like to stress this point. Until the Blowering Dam is built, the full value of all the water available cannot be obtained. Great areas of the Murrumbidgee and Murray valleys are capable of irrigation. The taking of water on to that very fertile country is being delayed because the construction of the Blowering Dam has not yet been started or even considered. I think it will be found that the reason is that the State Government is marking time in the hope that more Commonwealth money will go into this undertaking. The other day the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> gave very formidable figures in regard to the enormous sums of money that had been made available to the States by the Commonwealth Government. New South Wales has wasted millions and millions of pounds in starting dam projects and never completing them. We have the instances of the Glenbawn, Keep it and Burrendong dams. Dams are started but not completed, and one is inevitably led to the conclusion that the allocation of funds in New South Wales is guided not so much by the needs of the State as by the political value of spending money in certain places. </para>
                    <para>No State government which understood the importance of rural production to the national economy could neglect the valleys of the Tumut and the Murray by failing to spend money on snagging and so maintaining the full production of those valleys. New South Wales has the task of building the Blowering Dam. Time and time again in the local press we have statements under the name of the Minister for Conservation in the New South Wales Government to this effect: " We cannot do this. We have not the money. The Commonwealth has all the money ". If I were a South Australian, or a West Australian, I would be very critical of the amount of money which is concentrated in New South. Wales. The Government of the State is getting ample funds to build these dams. It has spent much more than Â£18,000,000 on starting such projects in other parts of the State. Enormous- projects are waiting completion, but the Government never finishes one: Instead it uses money to start new works. Unless the Blowering Dam is built, greater floods will go down the Tumut River, and 200,000 acres of irrigable land will be lost. </para>
                    <para>We cannot afford to neglect this opportunity. In that rich valley we have prospects of employing large numbers of our increased population in rural production, and in all the industrial undertakings and the essential services associated with that production. This will be possible because of the availability of a plentiful supply of cheap water. These opportunities are being neglected because we have in New South Wales a government that will not face up to its responsibilities. That is all I have to say about that aspect of the matter. </para>

I merely wish to direct attention to the fact that we will not be able to use the extra water in the most effective way until the Blowering Dam is constructed. It cannot be expected that the Commonwealth will spend all the available money in New South Wales. The only authority that can build the Blowering Dam is the Government of New South Wales. It has not started on the construction of that dam, and rumour has it that construction will be commenced in about 1970. We hope that the Government of New South Wales will change long before then. </para>

                    <para>I believe that this great Snowy Mountains scheme has not been given sufficient prominence throughout our nation. It is true that the scheme will benefit, primarily New South Wales and Victoria, and, to a minor degree, South Australia. The project was initiated principally to generate hydro-electric power for New South Wales and Victoria and to supply water for irrigation purposes to those two States. I am sure that these objectives will be achieved, and, as a consequence of the water conservation aspects of the scheme, added quantities of water will be available to South Australia. </para>
                    <para>It. is one of the proud boasts of the Australian Labour party that, after 50 years of talk about a scheme of this kind, it was left to a Labour government to initiate the project, which is recognized as one of the major hydro-electric and water conservation undertakings in the world. </para>

                    <para>It is known that the former Minister for Works in this Government, the honorable member for Chisholm <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)</inline> was most outspoken in his criticism of and hostility to the Snowy Mountains scheme. When a member of the Cabinet who is largely charged with the duty of carrying out the work is openly hostile to the scheme, how can we expect to see very much enthusiasm associated with the undertaking? The marvellous aspect of the matter is that the scheme has been carried on so successfully. I know that it is very difficult to persuade various Australian States to agree on any major undertaking. Alfred Deakin, in his book published some 25 years after his death, while admitting the faults in the Constitution said, " The miracle is that there is a federation ". We may say to-day that the miracle is that there is a Snowy Mountains scheme in progress. We know that the New South Wales and Victorian governments could not agree, and it was left to the Commonwealth Government, acting under what it imagined were its defence powers, to commence the project. Once it was commenced, no government was big enough to resist it, because: the Australian people in all the States, no matter what political party was in power in the various State governments,, demanded that the scheme be carried through to fruition. Some of the Ministers of the Labour government which initiated the scheme are in&gt; this House to-day. They include the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chifley Labour Government committed this Government and, ultimately, the governments of New South. Wales and Victoria, to the carrying out of this grand scheme. </para>
                    <para>I join with the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> in expressing the hope that when the scheme is completed - and I also hope that the tempo of construction will be speeded up - the same system that has been followed in the construction- and financing of the Snowy Mountains scheme will be applied to schemes in other States. Australia is the driest of the world's continents, and every effort must be made to- take full advantage of all the available water. We receive very, large falls- of rain on the eastern seaboard, but west of the Great Dividing Range the country generally becomes drier and drier, the centre of Australia and a large part of Western Australia being mainly desert. </para>
                    <para>The Snowy Mountains scheme, broadly, involves the turning back to the western side of the Great Dividing Range of the great volume of water available from the large quantities of rain and snow that fall in the southern alps. In the process, large amounts of electricity will be generated. The scheme is of great magnitude. It is estimated that it will produce, upon completion, 3,000,000 kilowatts of electricity each year. At present this amount represents three-quarters of the total output of all steam generating stations in Australia. Two States, New South Wales and Victoria, will benefit from this electricity production. Industrialists will gain a great advantage in being able to draw on this increased electricity output. The generating station at Guthega, which has been in operation since 1955, has an output at present of 60,000 kilowatts, although it does not produce this quantity for 24 hours each day. Electricity has been produced at this station at a cost of .91d. a kilowatt-hour, making it prob ably the cheapest electricity produced in Australia. Honorable members can understand that industrialists who can draw electricity from this scheme will have a great advantage over those in other parts of Australia. I am somewhat at variance with several honorable members, some of them in my own party, who are critical of the system of financing the Snowy Mountains scheme. We all know that it is being financed from Consolidated Revenue which is collected from the people of Australia in the form of income tax, customs and excise duties on cigarettes, excise on beer, and sales tax on various commodities. The Australian public are paying their due, through taxation, towards the construction of this undertaking. The Commonwealth is merely channelling the money drawn from the taxpayers to the Snowy Mountains Authority, which is the constructing authority. The Commonwealth Government is charging that authority interest at the appropriate rate - I think it is 5 per cent. - for all the money advanced to it. </para>
                    <para>Some honorable members have said that because the people pf Australia are financing this project, no interest should be charged on the money. I would agree with that contention if the same principle were applied to money allocated to all State authorities for constructing electricitygenerating stations throughout the Commonwealth. However, I fail to see why money should be advanced, free of interest, to construct electricity, generating stations which will supply electricity to the States of Victoria and New South Wales, when the money which is used by the State authorities of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland for the construction of electricitygenerating stations is obtained by way of loan from the Australian Loan Council on which they have to pay interest. If the money is to be advanced to the Snowy Mountains Authority free of interest, money should be advanced to the State electricity authorities for the construction of electricity-generating stations, free of interest also. The situation which obtains to-day is that interest is charged on the money advanced to the States of Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. That condition should apply to the Snowy Mountains Authority because, as a result of the Commonwealth Labour government's initiative in launching this scheme, the States of New South </para>
                    <para class="block">Wales and Victoria will have a great advantage over the rest of the States of the Commonwealth because of the benefit they will receive from the scheme. </para>
                    <para>I have no doubt that this scheme completely assures that the industrial heart of Australia will reach from Newcastle to Adelaide, and the rest of the nation, so long as we live in the age of coal and water generating schemes for electricity, will be merely secondary to this south-eastern corner of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I am prompted by the remarks of the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> to refer to another matter. Much has been said, during this debate, about the rights of South Australia, and fears have been expressed by some honorable members from that State that its water supply will be jeopardized. South Australia does not draw its water from the Murray River only, the source of which is in the Australian Alps. A considerable proportion of the water which flows into South Australia via the Murray has its source in Queensland. The Darling River, which flows through the whole length of New South Wales, has its origin in Queensland, and carries water from the fertile area of the Darling Downs with its lovely towns of Warwick, Toowoomba and Killarney, the place </para>
                    <para>Where angels pause and wonder if Eden were more fair. </para>
                    <para class="block">This water finds its way down the Darling into the Murray to supply the needs of the irrigation areas of South Australia and so reduces the salinity of the Murray in that State. What will be the position in South Australia if some future progressive Queensland Labour government decides to dam some of these rivers and hold back from the Darling, water in the State of Queensland? We are generous in Queensland, but I should hope that we are selfish also, to some degree. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Mackellar referred to the large Menindee Lakes scheme on the Darling in western New South Wales, where ultimately 2,000,000 acre feet of water will be impounded. This water will be used largely to irrigate the fertile plains of western New South Wales and it will also control the flow of water down the Darling into the Murray and through South Australia out to sea- The waters which will be impounded at Menindee will come via the Condamine, Warrego, the Balonne and a host of rivers which rise in the Dividing Range in Queensland and flow through western and southwestern Queensland into the Darling and through South Australia to the sea. It may be of interest to honorable members to know that the waters which ultimately find their outlet in the estuary of the Murray, in some cases rise near the Darling Downs city of Toowoomba. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As I said earlier, the Snowy Mountains scheme is most ambitious and extensive. To illustrate its value for generating electricity in terms of coal consumed for that purpose, let me say that the Adaminaby Dam, which is only one of the catchment dams in the Eucumbene River, will supply water to generate electricity equivalent to that obtained from 4,000,000 tons of coal a year. The demand for electricity is rapidly growing throughout Australia. It has been estimated that in southern New South Wales and Victoria it is increasing at the rate of 8 per cent, a year. This underlines the need for large generating schemes. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>But not only electricity is associated with this scheme, although that is the principal purpose for which it has been established and for which finance has been provided. There is also a by-product which will be costless to New South Wales and Victoria. I refer to the enormous volume of water which will be available for irrigation purposes in both States. Two years ago when a party of Labour members visited the scheme, the  chairman  of the Snowy Mountains Authority told us that the waters which will be turned into the Murrumbidgee - that is in New South Wales alone - on present-day figures, will increase the value of primary production in the areas it serves by more than Â£30,000,000. That is no mean sum. Surely that, in itself, from the primary producer's point of view, must justify this scheme which is now under way. </para>
                    <para>There is one issue that I would bring into the debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> with your indulgence. It is the possibility of the authority encouraging winter sports in the Snowy Mountains area. I had the good fortune, with some other members of my party, to visit that area in September a couple of years ago. Of course, I had an overcoat with me. I was caught in a blizzard. To a Queenslander, that was something out of this world. The blizzard lasted for two days and a night. Snow fell and covered the mountains, and the scene was something which I can describe only as being like a picture on a Christmas card from the other part of the world. I am sure that there are wonderful opportunities for the opening up of this area ultimately, so that Australians, particularly those who would love to see the snow in all its glory, could go there to indulge in winter sports. </para>
                    <para>It is to the eternal credit of the Australian Labour party that it launched this scheme. It is not to the credit of members of the Liberal party that they boycotted it. But I feel that the scheme is now divorced from party politics. Labour launched the scheme, got it under way and, to put the matter crudely, forced it down the necks of all other parties in the Commonwealth. There is now no party which is prepared to abandon this grand Australian scheme. I would say that it represents the first real attempt by a Commonwealth Government at nation-building. Whereas, in the past, undertakings have been constructed, because of legal restriction, by the State authorities, this big undertaking is being built by a Commonwealth authority, in agreement with the State governments. As I said earlier, the scheme was launched without the agreement of the State governments. Having gone so far, it must continue. </para>
                    <para>I am not as pessimistic as the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson)</inline> who stated that the Blowering Dam might not be completed until the next century. I look forward to the day when I shall sit on the other side of the chamber, perhaps in the near future, and hear an announcement that the scheme has been completed and is in production. It will be a very proud day for Australia when that takes place. I believe that, should the Labour party be successful at the next federal elections - and there is every indication throughout the nation that it will be - the tempo of construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme will be considerably increased, to the advantage of the nation. </para>
                    <para>When one reads history, it is rather strange to read of the great orators in the Liberal party advocating what should be done to develop the nation. The great " doers " in the nation - those who really do the work and launch the schemes - are members of the Australian Labour party. The great Western Australian statesman, Lord Forrest, was the first Australian to be raised to the peerage for his grand work as an Australian. Writing of him, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, then a member of the Australian Labour party, said that although Lord Forrest was an arch critic of Labour governments, he had found that Labour governments gave to Western Australia all the things that Lord Forrest had advocated; and that the governments of which Lord Forrest had been a distinguished member always refused his request to have developmental works granted to Western Australia when they were in office. We know that it was a Labour government that gave the State of Western Australia the Trans-Australian railway. We know that a Labour government, under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> initiated the standard gauge railway to Leigh Creek - a railway which gave a great boost to South Australia by enabling the carriage of coal by rail to Port Augusta. All the States of the Commonwealth have received great assistance from Labour Commonwealth governments. They have received some financial aid from the present Commonwealth Government. It is a matter of grave concern to me, and a cause of bitter disappointment, that throughout the 670,000 square miles of my native State - the great fertile northern State - not one penny of federal money is being given for the construction of any scheme of public works. </para>
                    <para>I know that some years ago, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was Prime Minister and Treasurer, he informed the Premier of Queensland that he would be prepared to finance the construction of the Burdekin dam on the same basis as that on which the Snowy Mountains scheme is being constructed. The people of Queensland rejected the Chifley Government and, of course, by democratic means, they have rejected the Burdekin scheme. I hope that the time will come when they will realize that that wonderful hydro-electric and water conservation scheme can be implemented only if it is financed by the 'Commonwealth Government at Canberra. We -all -know that the only worthwhile taxing authority in Australia is the Commonwealth Government. That is why the Snowy Mountains scheme can he financed, as it is being financed, by the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                    <para>I am glad to have been able to say a few words - not too many - on this really grand Australian scheme. I am proud to be a member of the Australian Labour party, which fathered the scheme. I hope to be in the .Parliament when a government comprising members of the Australian Labour party will see the scheme brought to complete fruition. </para>

The honorable member for Gippsland and other honorable members will be reminded, in the course of my remarks, of what Western Australia is contributing towards the scheme, although it is gaining nothing from it. The course of this debate has rather intrigued me. Frequently, it has been my lot to rise in this place to press upon the Commonwealth Government and the Parliament the claims and needs of Western -Australia. I always hear the cry from both sides of the House, "Be national in your outlook. Do not be parochial." In the course of this debate, dealing with the conditions under which the Snowy Mountains Authority must operate and the agreement between New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth in connexion with *.he use of the water from that scheme, we have heard the most parochial speeches that I have ever had the misfortune to listen to in this Parliament. South Australia is attempting to avoid what it believes will be some loss of its rights. Victoria is insisting on a certain percentage of the water that is to be made available from the scheme, and New South Wales is adopting the same attitude. </para>

                            <para>- For the benefit of my Australian Country party colleague from Queensland, the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brimblecombe),</inline> I complete what I was about to say, that large parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are uninhabitable. I know that honorable members adopt the same attitude that I adopt: They defend their States, but facts and an investigation of the geography and topography of Australia will confirm the soundness of my claim. I do not deny that portions of Western Australia are not capable of producing a yield as high as that achieved in other parts of the State, or in the eastern States, but to call them desert areas is absolutely wrong. It would be equally wrong to say that large portions of New South Wales, over which I have often flown, are uninhabitable wildernesses. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Griffith said that a generous Commonwealth Government had provided the trans-continental railway for Western Australia. That railway was not built with any altruistic motive to benefit Western Australia. It was built so that the eastern States, the industrialized areas of the Commonwealth, could communicate more rapidly with the west and more readily expand their very valuable trade with the most productive part, per capita, of the Commonwealth. That is all I wish to say in reply to the honorable member for Griffith. </para>
                    <para>The debate has intrigued me in that it has indicated that the spirit of interest in the welfare of one's own State is not dead in this place. I only hope that in future when a member from Western Australia, be he a supporter of the Government or a member of the Opposition, rises to advance the claims of his State, he will not be twitted with having failed to adopt a national view. I hope that all honorable members will remember that at some time or other they have engaged in a battle on behalf of their States. </para>
                    <para>I and my colleagues from Western Australia do not begrudge the tremendous expenditure - more than Â£400,000,000 - involved in this scheme. We confess that the scheme makes our mouths water. We envy the good fortune of Victoria and New South Wales in having such a huge sum of money spent in order to provide them with power and water at a rate cheaper than it will be available anywhere else in the Commonwealth. We are not unmindful of the fact that neither of those States will be called upon to contribute one penny towards the cost of the scheme. The gesture is a magnificent and generous one, whatever its genesis, and honorable members from Western Australia envy the States that will benefit from it. </para>

                            <para>-  I am jealous. I cannot help being jealous. I am sure that all honorable members will agree that Western Australia has been dealt with in an extremely niggardly fashion by the Commonwealth in relation to development projects. It is true, as has been mentioned, that some money has been provided to; assist in the improvement of water supplies, in Western Australia. But let me remind the House that New South Wales and Victoria will not be called upon to contribute one penny towards the Western Australian scheme. After about fifteen years of negotiations Western Australia obtained from the Commonwealth a subsidy towards water development and reticulation in the rural areas of my State on the condition that Western Australia contributed Â£1 for Â£1 of the cost. Is it any wonder that we envy New South Wales and Victoria their participation in the Snowy Mountains scheme free of cost to themselves? When Western Australia submitted a proposal for assistance in water development, the Commonwealth ultimately agreed to contribute but only on a Â£l-for-Â£l basis. </para>

                    <para>The Snowy scheme was introduced, as the honorable member for Griffith has said, mainly as a defence project. That was the pretext upon which the Commonwealth entered into the scheme. I do not say that that attitude was not justified. It was, but does not the western side of the continent deserve to be defended also? Of course  k  does! The western coast of Australia is the most defenceless part of the continent. Leaving aside the needs of industry and the rural areas, and the need to develop the State, and looking at the question only from the defence point of view, I contend that adequate water supplies are more urgently needed in Western Australia today, and will be in the future, than on the eastern coast. There is no chance of defending Western Australia properly unless the existing water supplies are improved. But Western Australia could be properly defended if the Commonwealth undertook to provide adequate supplies. </para>
                    <para>In Western Australia, at Pearce, in my division, an Air Force station is being rapidly expanded to meet defence requirements. Honorable members may be astonished to know that that station has no reticulated, water supply but obtains its water from underground - a most unreliable source. The major air force station in Western Australia is in that condition. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the honorable member might ask his own conscience what he is going to do to assist the nation as a whole to have an equal opportunity for development, instead of looking at the question from a purely party point of view, as he has done in relation to Western Australia. Western Australia's need for an assured water supply from the defence angle alone is greater to-day than is that of the eastern side of the continent, where water is abundantly available, although at present it might not be adequately stored. Western Australia, on the other hand, needs to conserve its supplies of water because of the nature of the country and the low rainfall. It will take time to  do  these things, but the time to start is now, and not later, when we find that we have neither enough time nor sufficient resources to provide very necessary water supplies. </para>

                    <para>Earlier in the debate, when it was pointed out that the whole of the cost of the Snowy Mountains scheme was to be borne by the Commonwealth and that Victoria and New South Wales were making no contribution, the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton),</inline> who is in charge of the bill, said that that was only a temporary arrangement. I know that the bill provides that the capital cost is to be recouped from the charges for the power that will ultimately be supplied by the scheme. The capital cost is, in effect, being financed by temporary supply granted by the Commonwealth. When the capital cost is recouped from the charges made for the electric power supplied, will the people of Western Australia, Queensland, and South Australia, who will receive no benefit from the scheme, receive some return of the moneys that they have contributed through taxation towards the financing of this scheme, or will the funds recouped go into the general revenues of the Commonwealth? </para>

                            <para>- Of course I know the answer, and that is why I say that we in Western Australia also would be glad to obtain temporary financial accommodation in this way. We, too, would be glad to obtain a loan - if one likes to use that term - in order to finance the development of water and power resources. I am most deeply concerned about water, however, because it is the basis of the Snowy Mountains scheme, and the effect of the scheme upon water supplies has been the main theme of the debate on this measure. We in Western Australia, also, would be glad to obtain a temporary loan for the development of water resources, the loan to be repayable over a period at least as long as it will take to recoup the cost of the Snowy Mountains scheme. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that we in Western Australia do not begrudge the good fortune of the eastern States, which are to receive the tremendous benefit of the Snowy Mountains scheme. We look upon it with envy, but we do not begrudge it. All honorable members who have participated in this debate have approved the scheme, blessed its authors, and praised the present Government for the splendid work that it has done in financing the scheme and pushing it ahead to completion in record time - we are unanimous in those sentiments - and I hope that, in time to come, members of the Parliament will be equally generous towards Western Australia in ensuring that that State receives the benefit of financial accommodation from the Commonwealth for the development of its water resources. I might include Queensland in that also. Indeed, I hope that members of the Parliament will, in the future, be equally sympathetic in pressing for the provision of Commonwealth financial assistance to promote the development of the less highly developed States, and especially to ensure the proper defence of the more remote areas of those States. I hope that members of the Parliament, instead of adopting a narrow State approach, will in the future support representatives from Western Australia should they appeal to this Parliament for financial assistance to promote the development of resources, including water supplies. </para>

                        <para>.- We have heard recounted in this debate the whole history of the Snowy Mountains scheme, and it is not my intention to go over much of the ground that has already been traversed. The history of the scheme is interesting, but we have heard it so often, read so much of it - and recently seen in King's Hall a display featuring the scheme - that speeches which merely record the history of the project are not of much value in this debate. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We have heard a great deal of bickering about who was really responsible for the scheme. All I shall say is that it is on record that a Labour government laid the foundation-stone and non-Labour governments have done the work. I do not see how any Opposition member can say otherwise. However, whoever is responsible for the scheme, we all agree that it is a great undertaking - one of the greatest in Australian history. But all these things are in the past. Up to the present time, the scheme has been scientific engineering, mathematical calculation, and hard work, which have resulted in its becoming, in part, already an established fact. In the short speech that I propose to make I shall deal, not with what has been happening, although I am concerned about that, but with my concern about the way in which water and power provided by the scheme will be used in the future. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members from South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales who have already spoken have dealt with the way in which the waters of the Murray River are to be apportioned between those States, but it must be remembered that the Snowy Mountains scheme is intended also to provide much hydro-electric power. The combination of the additional water and power should do much to increase primary production and could decentralize secondary industries. In this country, we are up against a very serious problem in the magnetic attraction that the great metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne have for our people, and especially for new Australians, far more of whom are settling in those two cities than is good for the economy. It is, of course, very hard to decentralize population, factories and other' things that are already centralized, but the additional water and electric power that the Snowy Mountains scheme will provide could be used to develop factories and secondary industries generally and to increase primary production in the only part of the country where primary products can be produced - in the rural areas. All honorable members agree that Melbourne and Sydney are too large, but it is a well-known fact that Sydney especially will get much of the power provided by the Snowy Mountains scheme after the needs of the Australian Capital Territory have been met. Melbourne, also, will benefit considerably from the power provided by the scheme, though perhaps largely indirectly. </para>

                    <para>One can well understand the attitude of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Ward). I was advocating - and still am - the decentralization of population and industry. Of course, the parliamentary life of the honorable member for East Sydney depends upon centralization. If a member of the Australian Country party advocates decentralization, he can see that, if it is implemented, his parliamentary life would slip away. Therefore, he immediately calls for a quorum. </para>
                    <para>I believe that we must ensure that the metropolitan areas are not extended further; the growth of the metropolitan areas must be retarded as much as possible. Through this scheme we have a God-given opportunity to provide what this country needs, it it is to become the great nation that many people have forecast it <inline font-style="italic">will</inline> be. How will this come about? After all, men like the honorable member for East Sydney, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> or the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> will not co-operate because they are residents of metropolitan areas. Therefore, the country people must be placed in a strong enough position not only to advocate but indeed to bring about the means of decentralization. </para>
                    <para>In the fertile Murray valley at present there is a very active organization named the Murray Valley Development League. Its members give their time and money with the object of increasing the population, the industries and the production of the Murray valley. I suggest that the Government co-operate as much as possible with such organizations. I am not parochial enough to say that the Murray Valley Development League could also deal with the Murrumbidgee valley in its entirety, but undoubtedly similar organizations could be formed in that area. The executive and the rank and file members of the Murray Valley Development League are men with considerable knowledge of primary production and of the flow of the river. They know that, if the fertile Murray valley can be given the water that it needs, it will grow the products that Australia requires so urgently to maintain its overseas balances so that the secondary industries can obtain the raw materials they need to function satisfactorily. </para>
                    <para>If I do nothing else to-day, I make the plea that the Government and the Opposition co-operate with rural bodies, and with men -of knowledge and of high principle to encourage the building of secondary industries in rural areas to use the power and water that will be made available by this great scheme, rather than to expand the metropolitan areas. I have heard honorable members on each side of the House say that, if war came, the whole of the metropolitan areas could be annihilated and the whole of Australia's economy disrupted by one atomic bomb. I have not tried to put this matter on a parochial basis or to enter into paltry party politics, as a certain honorable member, now interjecting, whom I will not name is always doing. I will not name him for his own good, because I do not think there is any man so steeped in party politics that perhaps there is not some good in him. I believe that this honorable member may have some altruistic qualities, and I hope that what I have said will penetrate the chinks in his armour and that he will realize that my proposal is for the benefit of all the people of this great country. </para>

                        <para>. - in reply - I have no wish to wound the susceptibilities of the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coutts)</inline> or any other honorable member opposite, but it is wrong to suppose that this great Snowy Mountains scheme is a new idea. Indeed, it is a very old idea. It was old when this century was young and it was young when the previous century was old. A scheme such as this is of the greatest importance to the people of our country, whether some of them know it or not. So far as I am personally concerned electorally, this scheme and schemes of this kind are of transcendental importance to the people of the Riverina, to the people of western New South Wales and to the people of Victoria, and, despite all that has been said to the contrary, to the people of South Australia; this scheme is of fundamental importance to the whole of the people of our country. </para>

                    <para>There was a time, of course, when we were preoccupied with irrigation schemes and with the conservation of water resources within the geographic limits of the States. That occupied our attention and the attention of the States until the first decade of the present century. Although the conception of the idea of the diversion of the snow-fed rivers of the Snowy Moun tains is lost in antiquity, it was at that time, when the irrigation schemes of the three principal States were being devised, that the idea of the diversion of the snow-fed rivers excited the minds of the pioneers. Because of our preoccupation with work that was being done in the three States, no useful purpose could be served in vigorously prosecuting such a proposal. However, when the .irrigation schemes demonstrated faults and frailties in all the States, it was recognized that something would have to be done to boost the waters in the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River and to use the waters in the tributaries of those two rivers, which up to that point in our history had been flowing away to the sea. </para>
                    <para>Proposals were put by the Australian Country party to the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> when he was Treasurer. Proposals of the kind were put to the Prime Minister at that time - he who is now described as My Lord Bruce. Proposals were put to the Premier of New South Wales and to the Premiers of Victoria and South Australia. But the only argument that we had at that time was that water should be conserved. Because only a limited number of people in our country are interested in the conservation of water, very little public interest could be excited on this question at that time. </para>
                    <para>I have been associated with this proposal in a minor way for nearly 40 years. I vividly remember coming to this place in the early 1920's and hearing my predecessor as member for the Riverina, the late W. W. Killen, advocating this proposal in this very place. Yet he had no support of any description from honorable members opposite. I have heard the right honorable member for Cowper advocating this proposal, and similar proposals, but getting no support from honorable members opposite. If those appeals for a practical demonstration of interest by honorable members opposite had been more successful at the time they were made, these proposals might be much more advanced than they are to-day. But by the time the economic blizzard of the early '30's struck us, no one was seriously concerned with the extension of our irrigation schemes. At that time it looked economically hopeless to attempt to expand any of our primary industries and it did not seem wise to expand any of our irrigation schemes. </para>
                    <para>It was in that frame of mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that we went into World War II. But the disastrous years of 1944 and 1945 - disastrous so far as the vagaries of our climate and the results of those vagaries were concerned - had a serious impact and it became obvious to thinking people that something would have to be done to increase the water flowing in our two major rivers, the Murray and the Murrumbidgee. Deputation after deputation came to this place, as deputations went to the State parliaments in Victoria and New South Wales, with concrete proposals for the diversion of these snow-fed rivers. The deputations suffered from the disadvantage that all that they could talk about was water. It was not until the question of the generation of electricity was introduced and strengthened the proposals that they put up, that the public interest was excited and this scheme ultimately was examined. It was examined, first of all, by committees of experts, representative of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria. Because they reported favorably on this scheme, the government was obliged to convene conferences at the ministerial level. </para>
                    <para>In New South Wales and Victoria, there were anti-Labour governments which were seized with the importance of this particular project. The Commonwealth Government at that time was, on the sheer merits of the decisions reached by these ministerial conferences, obliged to introduce the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act for the first time. That was in 1949. The proposal, in its physical sense, provided for the diversion of the snow-fed rivers, for the generation of electricity, for the feeding of the electricity into the grids of New South Wales and Victoria, after the Commonwealth requirements and the defence requirements had been met, and the handing over of the water, after the electricity had been generated, to the States of Victoria and New South Wales free of charge, the charges incidental to the operations of the Snowy Mountains Authority to be met from the sale of electricity to the two States. </para>
                    <para>It was at that stage that the bill was introduced. It was also at that stage, if there had been any flaws in the proposal at that time; if it were considered that South Australia would be disadvantaged to any degree; and if it were thought that Victoria and New South Wales were getting too much, that it was the manifest duty of the government in office - which is now in Opposition - to correct those faults and amend the provisions. As I have said, the bill was introduced in 1949 and passed both Houses of this Parliament. In 1951 it was amended, but there was no suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who was present then, as he was prior to 1949, that it should be amended. The act was amended again in 1952, and also in 1955 and 1956. Now, it is being amended to the degree that, for the first time, an agreement has been reached by the three parties and has been signed. The necessary complementary State legislation has been passed in the two States, and now it is the responsibility of this Parliament to pass the bill that currently is before the House. It has been passed by the other place, where a similar attempt to amend it was made. That attempt met the fate that I hope this proposed amendment will meet in the course of the next few minutes. </para>
                    <para>It is an extraordinary attitude for the Labour party to take in saying, "We support this measure ", and at the same time introducing an amendment which, if it were carried, would delay the effective operations of the Snowy Mountains Authority in  a  more grievous way than any other that I can imagine. It seems to have been completely forgotten that, for seven long, weary years, the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> who is the responsible Minister so far as the Snowy Mountains Authority is concerned, has been trying, day in day out, week in week out, month in month out, to get the States to put their signatures to a document that would seal the position of the authority and all its works. The Minister, to my certain knowledge, has applied himself to the task with a sincerity that is most unique. I want to say that I have kept in close touch with him, right from the inception of the scheme, and have asked him from day to day about the prospects of getting the agreement signed by Victoria and New South Wales. At last he has succeeded. The agreement has been signed by those two States, without prejudice to South Australia or any other State or States; the necessary legislation has been introduced and passed in the State Parliaments, and now it is for us to perform the final act in the first phase in the completion of this magnificent project. There is some slight danger that our passing of the act may be impeded by the Opposition, it having failed, of course, to impede it in another place. </para>
                    <para>I listened to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. His complaint, of course, was that South Australia might be prejudiced, that there could be an advantage to either New South Wales or Victoria, and probably to both, and that that advantage would prejudice South Australia. Because of that, he contended, the whole bill should be put in a state of suspense until the point was clarified in some litigious way. But the Leader of the Opposition is nearly ten years too late. He should have insisted in 1949, when the first act was passed, that South Australia should be more adequately protected, if he were in any doubt about the matter. The right honorable gentleman was a party to all the preliminary conferences that were convened by the government of which he was a member, and it was his manifest duty to say to the officers attending those conferences that their first charge was to protect the interests of South Australia, or of any other State. But he did not say that. He knew that the officers would do their duty and that they would mete out justice to all the States concerned. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable gentleman had another opportunity when an advisory conference was held and the scheme ultimately was adopted by that conference. He could have attended, as  deputy  leader of the government at that time, and suggested to the advisory conference that something more should be done to protect South Australia. Then, he had opportunity after opportunity during the sittings of the inter-departmental committees. He had a priceless opportunity at the Premiers conference in 1947, because that was the conference which adopted the Snowy Mountains scheme. Indeed, it was at that conference that the Premiers of this country appointed a committee to apportion both the electricity likely to be generated and the water that was to be available, between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria. Strangely enough, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the present Premier of South Australia was one of those who attended that Premiers conference in 1947. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition knew of the arrangement for the establishment of a committee to make a division of the waters likely to be available, but the right honorable gentleman took no action then nor did he do so at any of the ministerial conferences that followed after those interdepartmental meetings and conferences of experts. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable gentleman knows in his heart, of course, that the interests of South Australia have been protected and are being protected by the River Murray Agreement. If he was in any doubt about that, he could have taken appropriate action to strengthen the position of South Australia. But there is no doubt in the minds of those of us who have an intimate understanding of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority in all its ramifications that the River Murray Agreement, signed in 1914, binds the three signatory States and the Commonwealth. It protects the interests of South Australia even in the case of diversion. </para>
                    <para>The River Murray Agreement concedes to the States the right to divert tributaries of the Murray above Albury, but it also provides that if and when the tributaries are diverted, the States concerned shall lose a compensating amount of water allocated below Albury. That is an arrangement that safeguards the position of South Australia without prejudice to Victoria or New South Wales. [Quorum formed.] </para>
                    <para>The House, the Parliament, and the people of Australia have to pay dearly for the unhappiness and misery that emanates from the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> who has just directed attention to the state of the House. He has the sort of mind that cannot bear to listen to logical argument and will not permit a debate such as this to be resolved on its merits for the everlasting good of Australia. Before the quorum was formed, I had reached a point when I had shown that the River Murray Agreement binds the three signatory States and the Commonwealth and protects the interests of South Australia even in the case of diversion. I had explained that although the States had power to divert tributaries of the Murray above Albury, they had to compensate for the loss of water from the flow below Albury. Similarly the Snowy Mountains Agreement is equally binding on the two signatory States and the Commonwealth. It also protects the River Murray Agreement and, moreover, the interests of South Australia. </para>
                    <para>It has been demonstrated in a practical way that South Australia is likely to receive great advantages from the activities of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Apart altogether from making safe the quantity of water that South Australia is entitled to receive under the River Murray Agreement, the scheme boosts the flow of the Murray to provide another 60,000 acre feet in South Australia, in season and out of season, regardless of the vagaries of our climate or any dry periods we might have to endure. It is written into this bill that South Australia shall not be prejudiced. For the information of honorable gentlemen, I direct the attention to clause 5b of the bill which provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">That ought to be enough for all honorable men. It ought to be enough for those of us who are keenly anxious to have this bill passed to give the final approval to a project that has been suspended in mid-air, so far as legislation is concerned, for seven or eight years. During those years, the authority set up to do the physical tasks incidental to the diversion of the snowfed rivers and the generation of electricity, has performed its task magnificently. It has advanced its work in a way that was never dreamed possible when the scheme was devised, or when it was commenced by the Labour Government in 1949. </para>
                    <para>This bill is of vital importance to the people of Australia. It means that there will be an acceleration of land settlement. It means that there will be a general expansion of irrigation farming both in New South Wales and Victoria. It means that greater supplies of water will be available to three States of the Commonwealth for all sorts of agricultural, pastoral and other purposes. It means that no less than 3,000,000 kilowatts of electricity will be available to the Commonwealth and to States, while the water available to the two States will be increased by 1,800,000 acre feet. That is a fabulous quantity of water which will be put to the best advantage when dams for conservation and regulation of the water are built. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, the major responsibility for the Blowering dam rests with the New South Wales Government. When it will be constructed only the Lord and the New South Wales Government might hazard a guess! While, so far as is competent and possible, we shall use water flowing down the Murrumbidgee, water from the Murray will be used to the best advantage and to give, perhaps, the greatest impetus to the irrigation schemes of the two States that this country has had in the last two decades. I appeal to honorable members to pass the bill as a matter of urgency. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the last half-hour or so we have had from the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline> a speech which I think was remarkable in quite a few ways. He gave a potted history of the movement which ultimately resulted in the project. He brought in, for instance, names like Bruce and Page - men who were the chief Ministers in the Commonwealth Government for many years and had the opportunity of bringing about this scheme. He said they were in favour of it, and that the Australian Country party was in favour of it. What they did about it was just nothing. I do not want to enter into any question of dividing credit for this undertaking, which has been carried out only because of two things. One was the courageous initiative - because the matter was full of difficulty - of the Chifley Labour Government; the other was the determination of the present Government to complete the scheme. Therefore, on any view, the credit is shared. Of course, the Minister does not understand that great projects in this field can only be carried out by some degree of co-operation, as in this case. </para>

                            <para>-  I did not wish to traverse the history of the project, but I wanted to put on record my answers to statements which I thought should be qualified. I emphasize that the amendment is proposed to make sure that the rights of South Australia will be safeguarded, and not forgotten. Is it necessary to have such a provision? The Minister says that clause 5 will ensure that the rights of South Australia under the River Murray Agreement are not affected adversely, and that that provision is sufficient. In our view, it is not sufficient. We have to say what those rights are, and the very question in dispute is: What do those rights consist of? The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> admitted this position quite recently. He produced a document which plainly admitted that in order to secure the enforcement of the rights of South Australia, this bill must be supplemented by an amendment of the River Murray Waters Act. Therefore, this so-called safeguarding clause does not protect those rights. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the Minister for Primary Industry, who interjected, not of the Minister who is in charge of the bill. It is quite obvious that the other legislation has to be amended. It is not enough to say in this bill that the rights under the other, unamended, legislation shall be preserved. The other legislation has to be amended and then we have to make sure that the rights of South Australia are preserved in the legislation as amended. That seems perfectly clear. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>But that is not all. The Prime Minister said that other amendments of the River Murray Waters Act have to be made. He has referred to the commission the question of what those amendments will be. We do not know what they will be. A report has been made. Will New South Wales agree? If it does not agree, no amendment is possible. Will Victoria agree? If those two States and the Commonwealth agree, and South Australia also agrees, the rights will be secured. </para>
                    <para>Our proposal is simple, clear, and absolutely necessary. It is that the actual proclamation of the act should take place only after each House of the Parliament has resolved that in its opinion all rights of the State of South Australia to waters of the river Murray are not adversely affected by the operation of the act. How can each House of the Parliament, or every member, say at this moment that the rights of South Australia are protected, when the Prime Minister has said, in effect, that they are not yet protected? The position is completely contrary to what is required. </para>
                    <para>Let me add something else. The legislation of the New South Wales Parliament will not come into effect until it is proclaimed. It will not be proclaimed until amendments of the River Murray Waters Act are made. That was stated the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renshaw,</inline> a Minister of the New South Wales Government. Therefore, the adoption by New South Wales of this agreement is subject to that condition. There will be a proclamation only when the River </para>
                    <para class="block">Murray Waters Act has been further amended. The position is similar in the case of Victoria. Obviously, both South Australia and the Commonwealth will have to be parties to the amendment. </para>
                    <para>That brings me to the Minister's final point. We support the project. How could the Australian Labour party do otherwise? It is the project of the Labour party, and the Minister was quite right in emphasizing that. We want to see the project effective. I have had put to me that it is quite possible for people to make errors on these agreements. I have consulted experts, and I am satisfied that the rights of South Australia are not yet protected under the River Murray Waters Act. Let us take the case of diversion under the River Murray Agreement. There is provision that if New South Wales and Victoria divert any of the streams, that will be taken into account in the distribution of the waters. But, as a matter of fact, New South Wales and Victoria have not diverted the streams. It has been done by the Commonwealth. There have to be provisions of that character. That is also referred to in the Prime Minister's speech. </para>
                    <para>New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth have to be satisfied as to the position. Why should the Commonwealth say, " We are completely satisfied ", when everybody knows that the passage of this measure will not carry the agreement into effect and that some amendment of the other act is necessary? Why should the matter not be postponed and dealt with then? Why should we not insert in the bill the proposed amendment, which would have exactly the same effect? </para>
                    <para>The South Australian members have put their case. All they want is to ensure that the benefit intended to be given to them by such legislation as the River Murray Waters Act shall be given. We want that position safeguarded and we think this is the only way in which it can be done. </para>
                    <para>I turn to the rival amendment of the Government, made in another place, which simply provides that nothing in this act shall be taken to affect the rights of South Australia under the agreements under the River Murray Waters Act. That limits the protection of South Australia to what is already contained in the legislation. There will be amendments to the River Murray </para>
                    <para class="block">Agreement. The Prime Minister has said that they will be necessary. He read a document of about 40 lines, which is embodied in " Hansard ". There, it is expressly stated that amendments will be necessary. I wonder whether the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton)</inline> has read that document. If he reads it he will see that he is making himself a party to the passing of this legislation, knowing perfectly well that it will not confer on South Australia the rights that it is intended should be given to that State. </para>
                    <para>It is obvious, therefore, that clause 5b of the bill, upon which the Minister relies and which was inserted in the Senate, is meaningless and is really a sham. I think, however, that the sham has been seen through owing to the able analysis of the legislation by those honorable gentlemen who have watched the interests of South Australia. They include many honorable members on this side of the chamber, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and his colleagues. They have analysed the legislation and worked hard on it. They are satisfied, as the Premier of South Australia is apparently satisfied, that the rights of that State are not yet protected. That is the case that we put. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no alternative but to reject the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> if for no other reason than that it is entirely redundant. There are, however, other reasons why it should be rejected. We have a government anxious to complete agreements with regard to a project that has been in operation for nearly ten years - ten years during which we have had dubious constitutional authority for carrying on the undertaking as far as it has gone. The Government is eager to complete agreements with the States involved, but we find the Opposition moving an amendment that can serve only to impede the progress of this vital undertaking, and basing its argument on an interpretation of what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is alleged to have said during his speech on the second reading of the bill. We hear the Leader of the Opposition, a jurist, advancing as one of the reasons that his amendment should be carried his interpretation of what the Prime Minister said. It is not for the Leader of the Opposition, for me or for any other man to interpret what the Prime Minister said, when it is within our power to quote word for word what he actually did say. That is the intelligent thing to do. It is the honest thing to do, and it is, I inform the right honorable gentleman, what I propose to do. This is what the Prime Minister said in the concluding paragraphs of his speech. </para>

                        <para>- J do not propose to take up much of the time of the committee. The Minister has not read the crucial document, which is an admission by the Prime Minister that the River Murray Agreement will have to be amended. If it has to be amended, and if that is known by the various parties to it, then protection is not granted simply by the insertion in this legislation of the clause on which the Minister relies. The Prime Minister read the document in the course of his speech. The document stated what had to be done in connexion with diversions of the tributaries of the Murray, particularly the Tooma River, and it went on to say - and this appears at page 1728 of " Hansard " - </para>

This effect can be achieved by permitting the States of New South Wales and Victoria to replace diverted water from any convenient source. </para>
                    <para class="block">If the water is going to be replaced, well and good, but South Australia is a necessary party to that agreement. I think it should be perfectly clear to any person who listens to the arguments, that whether I am right or wrong as to the merits of the case - that is to say, whatever the position of our criticism may be - that basic River Murray Agreement must be amended. It is no use giving to South Australia the rights that it already has, and no State Premier could agree to legislation unless adequate protection exists. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister himself set out the position when he produced the document. It is not a question whether he thinks the matter will work out all right. Possibly he does think it will work out all right, and perhaps it will.  His  opinion and hopes about it are one thing; the real hard fact of what the agreement does is another. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of my intervention is not in any way to hold up the scheme, which we support and which is going on, but only to see that the basic rights of South Australia are protected. The bill in its present form does not protect those rights and the Opposition wants the proposed sub-clause inserted to provide that each House of this Parliament shall have the right to examine the legislation again at a time when the rights of South Australia are recognized. </para>
                    <para>New South Wales and Victoria will not proclaim their measures, and South Australia will certainly not do so, but this Government will proclaim this legislation knowing that it must be amended later. The bill, in its present form, is unbusinesslike and absurd and instead of assisting South Australia to come into the scheme, it will have the opposite effect. </para>

                        <para>.-South Australia's rights to water are covered by the River Murray Agreement. Nothing in this bill, which is designed to support an agreement between three contracting parties, can possibly affect South Australia's rights under the River Murray Agreement. Because some doubts have been expressed on that proposition, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Government have agreed to resolve them by inserting clause  5b  in the bill which expresses in most clear and definite terms that nothing in this bill in any way affects the rights of South Australia. Therefore, the rights of South Australia, after the passage and proclamation of this measure, will be exactly the same as they were before this bill was introduced. At that time, South Australia was entitled to a fixed quantity of water in a normal year, and to three-thirteenths of the water at Albury in what is known as a period of restriction. For those reasons I feel that every one can support this bill as it stands because it does not affect or prejudice the rights of South Australia in any way. </para>

                    <para>What is the proposal contained in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)?</inline> It is to hold up the whole of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme until three States have come to an agreement on some matter which is not affected by this bill. If the amendment were carried it would mean the dismissal, immediately, or within a very short space of time, of 2,000 men from the Snowy Mountains project. Already the contract for the next leg of the undertaking has been signed, but that will be held up if this amendment is carried. If that happens, the Labour party will have to answer to the breadwinners of 2,000 families who will be thrown out of employment. </para>
                    <para>I am not prepared to support the amendment, for two reasons. The first is that it is quite unnecessary. I have said already that there is nothing in this bill which prejudices South Australia. I will not support the amendment because it proposes to hold up, indefinitely, if necessary, the whole scheme. The three States which are parties to the agreement may never agree and in the meantime the whole scheme will be held up and the employees thrown out of work. </para>
                    <para>At the second-reading stage I pointed out that this bill does not prejudice South Australia's rights under the River Murray Agreement. Nor does it affect, in any way, the legal proceedings which have already been taken by South Australia. Therefore, the question of whether the River Murray Agreement is amended or not depends upon agreement being reached between the four contracting parties to the terms of that agreement. South Australia is quite able to protect is legal rights, and we can trust the </para>
                    <para class="block">Premier of South Australia to see to that matter, whether he does so by legal action or by negotiation with the other contracting parties. </para>
                    <para>I suggest that this amendment proposed on behalf of the Labour party is sheer and utter humbug. All that it proposes to do is to reiterate the provision which has already been put in the bill. If adopted, it will hold up the work on the Snowy scheme while four contracting parties which are engaged in fighting elections and all sorts of other matters come to an agreement. The Labour party will not receive any thanks for this amendment from the 2,000 families whose breadwinners are employed on the Snowy but who, if this amendment were carried, would be thrown out of work. </para>
                    <para>What nonsense it is for honorable members opposite to pretend that they are friends of the workers! Every action they take both inside and outside this Parliament deprives the workers of proper employment. </para>

                            <para>-  It is a matter not ot politics but of facing facts. Already the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has pointed out that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has stated that in order to protect South Australia's interests adequately, the River Murray Agreement must be amended. All that the Opposition seeks to do in this amendment is to see that this bill which  we  are attempting to pass to-day will not be proclaimed until the River Murray Agreement is amended. Is there anything wrong with that? Surely there will not be a long delay. I am satisfied that the Premiers of the States concerned, unlike the members of this Government, are alive to the interests of their States and will hastily get on the job and amend the River Murray Agreement because it affects the welfare of this nation. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>It is obvious that members on the Government side want to bulldoze this measure through, as they do other measures. They are not really concerned about the interests of a smaller State like South Australia. The Premier of South Australia will owe his thanks to every member of this committee who supports this amendment if it is carried. I am sure that the people in the electorates of the honorable members for Sturt, Barker and Angas will be watching and waiting to see which way those members vote on this amendment. It asks only for a brief delay in the proclamation of this measure so that South Australia may be certain that its rights are protected. </para>
                    <para>There may be some hope on the part of the Government that, by pushing this bill through and proclaiming it immediately, it will provide a harvest for the lawyers and solicitors in the community. We are trying to protect the interests of the people in South Australia who depend on irrigation and the rights of those in the metropolitan areas who depend on water from the Murray for domestic uses in their homes. They have no protection at present. </para>
                    <para>The committee should feel indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for moving this amendment, which seeks to give to South Australians the protection that they seek. I remind the committee that there are good reasons for the people of South Australia having grave doubts about anything that this Government puts forward on the Snowy Mountains Agreement. When, twelve months ago, the Premier of South Australia asked to see the agreement, he was refused the right to do so. He was humbugged and pushed about by this Government. I believe that he, too, was playing the artful game of politics, but, whether he was doing that or not, it is the duty of every South Australian in this Parliament to support this amendment and ensure that the rights of the industries and the citizens of South Australia will be protected. Our amendment seeks only to allow time for the River Murray Agreement to be amended and for us to make sure, as the Prime Minister himself has suggested, in the only way in which that is possible, that protection is given to South Australians in this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- I have risen principally to say that I regard the amendment that has been moved as one of the most extraordinary examples of political opportunism that I have seen for a long time. It was political opportunism that actuated the honorable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Galvin),</inline> who has just spoken. What have the South Australian Labour members done to protect the interests of South Australia? The honorable member for Kingston underestimates the intelligence of the people who put him here, as so many Labour members do, if he thinks that they will be taken in by the synthetic indignation and tub-thumping in which he indulged. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>What the people of South Australia will ask themselves in relation to this matter is, " When did South Australian Labour members begin to take an interest in it? " They began to take an interest only three or four days ago. No representations were made to the appropriate people - the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> or the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> - on this question when it first arose, months ago. If Labour members were really interested in the rights of South Australia, they would have started working for them long before the bill came into this House. </para>
                    <para>Instead of taking the action most likely to be in the best interests of South Australia, at the last moment they have put up this amendment, completely ignoring the fact that the Prime Minister was able to announce to the Parliament, when he spoke on this subject, a number of points of agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales and Victoria - and, indeed, South Australia. If I may say so, modestly, this was partly a result of the hard work done by me and my colleagues from South Australia. The Prime Minister made it clear that the rights of South Australia were fully protected, or, if they were not, that the passing of this bill would not jeopardize </para>
                    <para>South Australia's situation under the River Murray Waters Act. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that he has put this amendment up against the amendment moved by the Government in another place. He has ignored the fact that, in addition to our amendment - which is, after all, only an additional safeguard - other safeguards have been provided which are not contained in this legislation. The Prime Minister told the House that, in relation to the Tooma diversion, the Premier of Victoria, the Premier of New South Wales and he himself had signed a document which stated, in so many words, that they intended to amend the River Murray Agreement. Do honorable members opposite suggest that the Premier of New South Wales - or the  Deputy  Premier of New South Wales, in the absence of the Premier - when he signs a document of that sort, does not intend to keep his word? The Opposition is engaging in hair-splitting. That takes care of the Tooma diversion. </para>

                            <para>-  I was saying, before the honorable member for Kingston tried to drown me out, that there are three things on which we base our case that the interests of South Australia are protected, apart from the amendment which was passed in another place. The first is that the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales have solemnly agreed to amend the River Murray Agreement. That has been concurred in by the Prime Minister. The second is that representatives of the four authorities, including South Australia, have met on the River Murray Commission, that all these points at issue have been put to them, and that they have been able to come to unanimous agreement. </para>

                    <para>I quite agree that that is not the same as saying that their recommendations have actually been accepted, because they have to go to their political masters. But are there grounds for believing that the recommendations will not be accepted when the representatives have been able to reach unanimous agreement? My third point - to reiterate what the honorable member for Sturt said - is that there is absolutely nothing in the Snowy Mountains Agreement which prejudices South Australia's rights under the River Murray Agreement. </para>

I take it that if the bill receives the Royal assent in its present form a number of sections in the principal act will be repealed, and that the repeal of those sections will become effective automatically. What provision is made to fill the gap until the proclamation of the provisions replacing those repealed? Will any long period be allowed to elapse before the gap is filled? </para>
                <para>It is now admitted that certain sections of the principal act, which was passed some years ago, have not yet been proclaimed. What is the use of the Parliament debating provisions of an act if they are never to be proclaimed, and, therefore, never to become effective? I have been consulted on this matter by the maritime trade unions, which consider that this situation should not be allowed to continue. Accordingly, the unions seek an explanation of the operation of clause 2. The unions also want to know why it is proposed to repeal section Ia of the principal act, as provided for in clause 3. </para>

This sub-section contains a definition of " British ship ", which was not defined in the principal act, and the unions want to know why this definition is now included. They also ask for an explanation of the change in the definition of " Australian-made ship ". I should be pleased to hear an explanation of those definitions from the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne).</inline></para>
                <para>The sub-section also contains a definition of " foreign-going ship " in the following terms: -  " foreign-going ship " means a ship employed in trading or going between a place or places in Australia and a place or places outside Australia; </para>

                <para class="block">Radio officers on various ships have been agitating for some time to be classified as officers. They are not asking that they be given any authority other than that which they at present exercise, but they consider that, as they are regarded as radio officers in the terms of their award and are always referred to as radio officers, they should be classified as officers. In the talks in 1955, no objection was taken to this request by anybody, including the departmental representatives. The Australian Labour party considers that it is quite reasonable. In most cases these men are employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, which hires the equipment to the various vessels. I am given to understand that the only exceptions to this rule are the vessels of the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited and the vessels operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. We consider that the request is reasonable, and I submit it to the committee. </para>

                    <para>. -  This may be a convenient time for me to make a few remarks, not only about this amendment, but also about amendments generally. As the committee knows, this bill was introduced in the Senate, where there was a very long and comprehensive debate. A number of amendments were moved in the Senate, and some ten of them were accepted. There is no facet of this bill that was not very thoroughly argued in the Senate. 1 mention that because I do not want honorable members opposite to feel that the Government is being obstinate, or is dismissing their views carelessly, when I say that the Government does not accept this amendment or any of the amendments submitted by the honorable member for East Sydney. Every arguable aspect of the bill was debated at great length in the Senate. As I say, the Government is not by any means obdurate about the measure, and has accepted no fewer than ten amendments from the Opposition in the Senate. The Government feels that the matter has been very fully and adequately debated. Notwithstanding that, I have myself been very carefully through the amendments proposed by the honorable member for East Sydney. For reasons that I will give as we progress, they are not acceptable to the Government. </para>

                <para>The amendment now before the committee seeks to include a wireless operator within the definition of a ship's officer. We believe this to be unnecessary. The honorable member for East Sydney said that all that the wireless operators in Australian ships desire is that they be given the status of officers. This does not affect their functions. In practice, they are almost universally given that status now. During the war, the practice grew up of referring to wireless operators as radio officers, and that practice is almost universally continued on the Australian coast to-day. </para>
                <para>Those included in the definition of officer in the bill are those who actually have to exercise authority over members of the crew - that is to say, masters, mates and engineers. This is in accord with the practice under the Merchant Shipping Act and the practice in other maritime countries. In a world-wide industry of this sort, departures from established practices throughout the world should not be undertaken carelessly. For that reason the Government prefers to wait and see how this measure works, before making amendments of this sort which have no real necessity. I point out that ships' surgeons and chief stewards, who have the status of officers, are not included in the definition of officer in the bill. The radio officer is in exactly the same position. We therefore do not accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The attitude of the Government in respect of this legislation is remarkable. I was amazed to hear the Minister for Air say, without having heard the arguments of the Opposition, that none of these amendments would be considered by the Government. He argued that the matter had been fully debated in the Senate. Surely that is an amazing attitude for a Minister to take. In this country we have a bicameral system of government; we have the Senate and the House of Representatives. It would be a most remarkable position if, after a matter was fully discussed in this chamber, the argument was advanced in the Senate that there was no need for a discussion there because the legislation had already been debated here. Despite the Minister's anxiety to speed up proceedings by indicating that the Government does not intend to accept any of the amendments of the Opposition, we still propose to put them forward. On the amendments that we regard as of extreme importance, we will divide the Committee, and we will certainly submit our views. </para>

                <para class="block">The proper authority has enormous powers in certain respects. Members of the various organizations affected by this legislation have no objection to the provision generally, but do object to the inclusion of a consul of any other Commonwealth country in the definition. They argue that many of these officials in various parts of the world would not be competent to make the decisions that a proper authority is called upon to make from time to time. They believe, therefore, that those words should be deleted. For instance, Ghana has been admitted to the Commonwealth. Surely no sensible member of the Parliament would believe that a representative of Ghana in some part of the world would be qualified to act as a proper authority and to exercise certain powers under this legislation. </para>
                <para>I therefore propose this amendment. Despite the Minister's statement that the Government does not propose to accept it, we put it forward in the belief that our submissions made on behalf of the organizations concerned will receive some consideration when these provisions are further reviewed, as no doubt they will be from time to time. </para>

                    <para>. -  With all respect to my honorable friend, I do not think that there is very much substance in this amendment. Now that Australian ships can, and do, travel all over the world, it is necessary to provide an authority in' any part of the world who can exercise powers given by the legislation. It is untenable that there should be some place without a person qualified to exercise these powers. In a Commonwealth country, we provide that the authority shall be a person holding an office equivalent to that of superintendent of a port in Australia. In countries other than Commonwealth countries, we provide that the authority shall be the Australian diplomatic or consular representative, if there is one. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There are many places in the world, at which Australian ships may call, where Australia has no diplomatic or consular representation of her own, and where there may very well be no properly constituted port authority, according to the laws of the country concerned. On the other hand, such authority as exists there may have different powers from those that we in Commonwealth countries know. Its status may also be different. The best person to nominate in such a case appears, to the Government, to be the diplomatic or consular representative of another Commonwealth country. That is the provision that it is proposed to insert, and it is a completely sensible one. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is the first opportunity that I have had to express a point of view which I think the Government should consider. Here, we have a definition of the term " wages ". The bill provides that " wages " includes emoluments. The committee has before it for discussion an act of Parliament that deals with the payment of wages, emoluments, and so on. When the Minister for Air spoke previously, he referred to the origins of the act, and traced them back to 1904. Then he dealt with its development throughout the years. In view of the history of the Navigation Act, I can appreciate the need to make provision regarding the payment of wages and emoluments, and matters of that kind, but for the life of me I cannot understand how we can ever expect to have a satisfactory state of affairs in relation to a large body of workers, whether they be seamen or any other workers, while three different authorities meddle with the question of wages and emoluments. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>To-day, we have a special section of the Arbitration Court dealing with nothing else but matters affecting seamen. There is an authority which looks at other phases of the work of seamen. Despite that, in this year of 1958, we find ourselves meddling with an act of Parliament in regard to this question of wages and emoluments. I believe that this position is a relic of the dark days. At some stage or other the unions, the shipowners and the other people who are concerned with this act and with the long series of amendments that I have seen since I have been in this chamber, should examine the possibility of putting matters which relate to wages into their proper perspective and leaving them for adjudication by the authority which deals with that matter in other phases of our industrial life. I believe that matters affecting the payment of wages and overtime, how payments are to be made, and so on, ought to be under the control of one authority - the industrial authority. It seems to me that to have provision made for them under both the Navigation Act and the conciliation and arbitration legislation is not in the best interests of seamen. I put it to the Minister that that matter should be considered on the next occasion that there is a conference of the parties for the purpose of dealing with amendments of this act. </para>
                <para>Quite frankly, I believe that the best way to get industrial satisfaction, apart altogether from industrial peace, in an industry, is to have all the matters that relate to wages brought within an award covered by one authority. I mention the matter now with a view to having the code of payments to seamen put into its proper perspective. </para>

                    <para>.- The short point here is simply the definition of " wages ". The provision is that " wages " include emoluments, and the honorable member for East Sydney has moved an amendment to provide that emoluments should be emoluments of any kind. He  ha9  stated that he has done so because he is afraid that, by limiting the meaning to include emoluments, something less than emoluments of any kind results and that, therefore, something is being taken away from the wage-earner. Actually, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> can understand the view he puts, because the words " emoluments of any kind " seem to be words of extension, but in fact, as a matter of law, those words of extension are quite unnecessary if we have the word " emoluments ", which means " emoluments of any kind ". I should like, so far as I am able, to give the honorable member for East Sydney that assurance. </para>

                        <para>- There might be many reasons for a man not returning to the ship. It may be that such factors as that would be taken into account when the penalty to be imposed was under consideration, but that does not alter the fact that the man is automatically branded a deserter if he is away from his ship wihout leave and without a reasonable excuse for more than 48 hours. Sickness may be regarded as a reasonable excuse, and be accepted as such, but for the purposes of this legislation, the mere fact that a man is away is sufficient ground for the imposition of a penalty. A man might not know when he left the ship that he would become ill and be unable to return to duty, but it would not matter what was the cause. </para>

                <para>A seaman is in employment just as much as a man who works in a factory. It is quite usual for factory workers or others to absent themselves from work from time to time. They lose their pay and they are penalized to that extent, but in this case, severe penalties are provided for desertion. Fines up to Â£40 can be imposed. I agree that a different attitude might be taken to absence from a ship without leave when the vessel was in a foreign port because there could be some difficulty in obtaining a replacement, but that difficulty would not exist in Australia. When a ship is in an Australian port or is operating around the Australian coast, it is easy to replace a man who is absent from his place of employment at the time the ship has to sail. </para>
                <para>The Opposition regards this provision as most objectionable. That is the attitude of the maritime unions and not merely those who would be affected in most cases. When I refer to the maritime unions on this occasion, I am talking of representatives of the officers and representatives of other crew members down to what might be regarded as the lower deck. When representatives of those organizations interviewed me and what we term the Industrial Committee of the Australian Labour party, they were unanimously of the opinion that this provision was objectionable and should be struck out of the bill. </para>
                <para>If the objective of the Government is the maintenance of peace in industry generally, but particularly in an important industry such as the maritime industry, it should meet the wishes of the organizations concerned who are unanimous on this point. The Minister said that the Government had decided these matters - I take it that he meant that the Cabinet had decided them - but I hope that there are some back benchers on the Government side who will adopt a reasonable attitude to the request for an amendment of this provision. </para>
                <para>What harm would my amendment do? It may be said that shipping is in a different position from other industries because if the complement of men is not available for duty when called upon to serve, a vessel may be tied up. That cannot happen in an Australian port. Who would suggest that so many men would be absent without leave from a vessel at any one time as to cause it to be tied up? In particular cases, probably only one or two members of the crew would be concerned. The provision is unreasonable and I hope that it will be rejected. </para>

                <para class="block">It is very difficult sometimes to establish intention. The tactic that was adopted in the past sometimes by a seaman who intended to desert was to leave some part of his clothing behind as an indication that he intended to return. To meet that difficulty, provision was made in the act in 1952 that he should also be deemed to have deserted from his ship if he was absent from it for a continuous period exceeding 48 hours without leave, lawful cause or reasonable excuse. I emphasize the words " without reasonable excuse". If a seaman is absent from his ship through sickness or some unavoidable cause for more than 48 hours, and the master will not listen to a reasonable explanation and treats him as a deserter, the man has ample remedies in the terms of the act to have the record altered. The provision is not harsh and there is no evidence that it has operated harshly in any case during the six years that it has been in operation. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister said that sometimes it was difficult to prove intention and that, in the past, seamen have on occasion left clothing behind and used that as an indication that they intended to return to the ship. I have not heard of such a case. The Minister may have some evidence of that practice. He said that proposed section 6b (b) was essential to cover such cases. If paragraph (b) is necessary, it is quite obvious that paragraph (a) is not essential. Why does the Government persist with both of them? The cases to which the Minister referred would be covered by paragraph (b) which provides that a man is a deserter if he is absent from his ship for a continuous period exceeding 48 hours without leave, lawful cause or reasonable excuse. The Minister's explanation may appear to be feasible at first glance, but I believe it is merely , an excuse which has been thought out in the department as an answer to the Opposition's amendment. </para>
                <para>The Minister said that this section of the act had worked effectively since 1952 and that there had not been any complaint. To whom would the men complain? The unions say that they have had any number of complaints regarding the operation of this section, but because this provision is in the legislation, the unions have not been able to do anything about the matter. That is the reason why the complaints have not gone beyond that stage. Now, at the first available opportunity, when the legislation is before the Parliament for consideration, the various maritime unions bring their complaints to the notice of the Parliament in the hope that this provision will be struck out. </para>
                <para>If the Minister for Shipping and Transport wants to satisfy himself that there is ground for complaint in respect of this clause, and that the opposition to it in the maritime unions is widespread, the way to find out is to confer with the maritime unions. </para>
                <para>Representatives of the unions wanted to come to Canberra. They had arranged to come here and see the Minister on a Monday. The Minister cancelled that arrangement at short notice and made the appointment for the Tuesday, on which day some representatives could not come because they had to appear in court. They arrived here on the Wednesday, but the Minister refused to see them. Is that the way to get industrial peace? Why did the representatives of the maritime unions want to interview him unless it was to make complaints in regard to the bill and request that certain changes be made? </para>
                <para>I assure the Minister that the representatives of these various organizations, who interviewed me and other Labour members, were unanimous in their attitude. I shall give the Minister their names, so that they may go on record. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rogers,</inline> of the Merchant Service Guild of Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnwell,</inline> of the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowan,</inline> of the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> of the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association of Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope,</inline> of the Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers Association of Australia; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> of the Seamen's Union of Australia. </para>
                <para>All of the maritime industry was covered, and every organization from that of the masters down was represented. They all agreed that this provision should be struck out. Yet the Minister stupidly states that no objection has been taken to it in the years since 1952. There has been any number of objections. The Opposition sug gests that it has led to a great deal of disturbance in the industry. </para>
                <para>The Government has refused even to consider the arguments advanced for the deletion of the provision. The Minister for Air has said, in effect, " We have made our decision. It is of no use for the Opposition to propose amendments and debate the matter. We have made up our minds ". I should imagine that the maritime unions will take a most serious view of the Government's attitude in relation to this matter. The Government would not even see their representatives and will not listen to the arguments submitted by the Opposition on their behalf. The Government rejected the amendment even before the arguments were devloped in this chamber. </para>
                <para>That could lead to a very serious position in the maritime industry. I believe that if the organizations concerned take a serious view, they will be quite justified in their attitude. If industrial unrest leads to a stoppage in any part of the Australian mercantile marine, as a result of the Government's attitude, in my opinion the men will be justified. I and, I believe, my colleagues, will support them in whatever attitude they adopt. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. O'Connor)</inline> asked whether the provisions in relation to desertion apply to officers as well as to seamen. I understand that the penalties for desertion, with which I think the honorable member was concerned, are applicable to officers as well as to seamen. The honorable member for East Sydney questioned the necessity for proposed section 6b (a). Since 1952 there has been in the act a provision relating to absence for more than 48 hours. I should have thought the need for the new provision is clear to anybody who reads it. If a seaman leaves his ship, using words which indicate quite clearly that he has no intention of coming back, he can be treated as a deserter forthwith without waiting for 48 hours. As I explained before, it is necessary to have some means of putting a limit to the time which must run before a man can be deemed to be a deserter. Paragraph (b) is designed to cover circumstances in which there is no clear evidence of his intention. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for East Sydney discussed this matter as if it were directed as a penalty against seamen. That is not so. There are provisions which make it impossible for a master to sign on in a crew a substitute for a man who has deserted, unless desertion can be established. If a man is legally absent, a substitute cannot be signed on. Until it is established within the law that a man is a deserter, a substitute for him cannot be signed on. It is quite incorrect to suggest that a ship cannot be held up in the absence of provisions such as this. The necessity for such provisions has been established. They are reasonable provisions. There is no evidence that the existing provision has operated harshly in the six years that it has been in operation. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there will be no attempt to take a vessel to sea in the event of an industrial dispute arising involving any section of the ship's personnel. The union representatives contend that unless these words are added a vessel could be towed into the stream and then be regarded as under way. This would mean that the remainder of the crew would be subject to direction. Because all the maritime unions are determined that there shall be no strike-breaking by any of their members when the members of one union are involved in a dispute, they consider that the addition of these words is absolutely essential.

                <para class="block">A ship might be deemed to have " got under way " if it were towed into the stream, and then the remainder of the personnel would be subject to direction and order. The unions consider that if engine room personnel are involved in a dispute, a ship should not be moved from the wharf, except by its own engines. The union regards this as an important amendment, and so do the members of the Labour party. We consider that the request of the union is reasonable, and we therefore submit the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am greatly indebted to the honorable member for giving me an explanation of the purpose of his amendment, because I confess that until now it had completely puzzled me. I think the honorable member is mistaken in his idea of the effect of the proposed section. If the honorable member's amendment were accepted it would have a most extraordinary effect. Let me give honorable members an example. There are provisions in this act which prevent a ship being taken to sea without the requisite complement. If the honorable member's amendment were accepted, a ship could be towed to sea without any complement at all and without being subject to the provisions of the act. The authorities responsible for seeing that a ship does not go to sea without a proper complement and without being properly prepared for sea would be absolutely impotent to deal with the position until the vessel got to sea, when it would be too late. The effect of the amendment would be the very reverse of what the honorable member for East Sydney envisages. I shall give another example. Under section 197 of the act a ship is not allowed to proceed to sea without proper certificates of survey. If the honorable member's amendment were accepted, it would be competent for a person who wished to take a ship abroad, to have it towed abroad, without any certificates of survey at all. I think the honorable member is completely mistaken as to the effect of the proposed section. Certainly it would be dangerous to accept his amendment - dangerous to the seamen themselves  - and the Government cannot accept it. </para>

                    <para>.- by leave - Despite what the Minister for Air has said in reply to the remarks I made in support of the amendment, I prefer to accept the opinion of the men engaged in the industry rather than that of the Minister. These men are the ones who are best able to judge whether the amendment is necessary. They are not inexperienced in the handling of these matters, as I think I indicated at an earlier stage of our committee deliberations. The men who submitted these matters for the consideration of the Labour party, which in turn has submitted them for the consideration of the Parliament, are all responsible members of their organizations. They know what is involved in the amendment that is proposed. I am prepared, as I say, to accept their word as to the necessity for this amendment. They regard it as necessary for their protection. The Minister seems to think that there is some protection in the manning provisions of the legislation against the kind of eventualities to which I have directed attention. I hope to be able to show when we come to a consideration of those manning sections that this protection does not exist, and that the men are quite justified in believing that the proposed legislation gives the shipowners or employers an advantage, in the event of a dispute occurring aboard a ship, in that they will be able to get the ship under way, and the seamen will then be under some restraint. </para>

                        <para>- It could be towed away without this amendment being accepted. However, the Minister says that it could not. If that is a fact, the Government should concede the amendment, because it would constitute an assurance to the men. The Minister contends that the vessel cannot now be towed away from the wharf with the proposed section worded in the way it appears in the bill. The men are of opinion that the vessel can be towed away. In my opinion the amendment is justifiable even if it merely has the effect of reassuring the men in the industry. Surely it is the aim of the Government - at least members of the Government say it is - to perserve peace in this important maritime industry, and in my opinion the Government should not lightly set aside the wishes of the employees' organizations in these matters. The Minister contends that my amendment does not mean anything at all. It means something to the men engaged in the industry, and I ask the committee to accept it. </para>

The honorable member for . East Sydney, if I understood him correctly, suggested that a ship might be statutorily deemed to have been taken to sea if in fact it had merely been pushed along by a tug or some other propulsive force. It is difficult for honorable members to appreciate the relevance of this amendment unless the Minister gives examples of the other provisions that may be affected by it. The honorable member for East Sydney may well be shown to be right if we postpone a decision on this amendment until after we have discussed other subsequent provisions that may be affected by the proposed amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have given one example. I will give another for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> Under section 14 of the act it is an offence for the owner of a ship to suffer the ship to go to sea unless it carries the prescribed complement of officers. A ship is said to have gone to sea, according to the definition in question, even if she has been towed to sea or towed away from a wharf. If the amendment of the honorable member for East Sydney were accepted, the vessel could be towed away without any complement of officers at all. Again, section 197 of the act requires that a ship must have proper certificates of survey before she can be got under way. If the honorable member's amendment were accepted a vessel could be towed away, or towed to sea as vessels sold abroad often are, without any certificates of survey, without a complete complement and without a sufficient number of officers. This amendment, instead of working to the advantage of mariners, as the honorable member for East Sydney apparently fondly believes, could work greatly to their detriment. I think the amendment is completely misconceived. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said " full " complement. If he checks the " Hansard " report of his remarks he will find that it shows conclusively that he has not made a close study of this legislation. When I was speaking to an earlier amendment, the Minister argued that a ship could not sail unless it had a full complement of officers. We now ask that this sub-clause be deleted, and if the Minister were consistent he would accept our amendment because, under this sub-clause, it is possible for a ship to sail with a certain number of officers but not necessarily with the full complement. </para>

                <para>The officers' association strongly opposes sending a ship to sea undermanned. If the proper authority goes into the matter, as I understand it does, and decides that a proper complement of officers and a proper complement of other sections of the crew shall be so many, then we consider that the number decided upon by that authority should be the irreducible minimum. It is the opinion of the officers' organization that a ship should not go to sea with fewer than that number, and apparently the Minister also held the belief that a ship must have its full complement before going to sea. It is not until we come to a consideration of this sub-clause that the Minister holds the view that a vessel can be taken to sea with fewer than the full complement of officers. </para>
                <para>This is a matter concerning the proper running of a vessel and the safety and security of those who travel in it. The officers' organization considers that in the interests of safety no ship should be allowed to go to sea without a full complement of officers. I hope that in this instance the Minister will be at least consistent and apply the principle which hitherto he believed did apply and accept our suggestion that a vessel must have its full complement of officers before going to sea. </para>

                <para>Under this sub-clause, in all cases where the superintendent or proper authority considers it proper, permission may be given for a ship to sail with less than its full complement of officers. This is a necessary and sensible provision. The need for it can occur in these circumstances: Honorable members no doubt know that often engineer officers and uncertificated junior officers are carried. In some cases capable people may be fulfilling junior positions in a ship and if, in the opinion of the superintendent or the proper authority, those persons are capable of carrying out the duties of one of the essential members of the complement for a particular voyage, then, in those circumstances, he allows the ship to go to sea. The provision will have all the safeguards of being dependent upon the decision of the superintendent or proper authority. It is a perfectly sensible provision, and the Government rejects the amendment. </para>
                <para>I should tell the committee that an amendment similar to this was submitted to the Senate, that it was fully debated there and that the Government's position was explained fully. </para>

                    <para>. -  What sort of confused argument is this? First, something is put up in the Senate and it is rejected by the Senate partly because the matter will be coming to this House for consideration, and then, when it does come before us for consideration, the Minister, who represents the same interest as the Government party in the Senate, refuses to look at it at all because the Senate has dealt with it. Therefore, we are deprived of consideration in both Houses of the Parliament. That is an absurd proposition. Am I to take it from what the Minister has said - it seems that I am - that there is a definite lessening of the fixed safety factor so far as the complement of the crew is concerned? What authority is there for the lessening of that requirement? Who says that this should be the provision? Why is the law being amended? It must be because the Government wishes to reduce the requirement. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with honorable members on this side in supporting the amendment, and I do not feel that the reasons given by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> a few moments ago warrant the flippant answer from the Minister that the Senate has debated the point fully and rejected a similar amendment. Because it has been rejected by the Senate is no solid argument why it should be rejected here. We know that members of the same government deliberate and make decisions in that chamber. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Who is to be the proper authority to decide the proper complement to take a ship to sea? Will it be a member of the Australian Country party, or somebody just as incompetent, or will the authority be thoroughly competent? We on this side know that the present Government often appoints people who know nothing about the duties they are expected to carry out. Are we to have this matter decided by a collection of individuals who do not know what is required to take a ship to sea safely? Just as it is essential that a football team should go into a match with the full number allowed by the rules, so is it essential that a ship should go to sea with its full complement of officers. Again, in rowing it is essential that the full crew take part in a race even though it is possible that some " proper authority " would allow a crew of seven instead of eight to take part. </para>
                <para>This provision is fraught with danger to the men who take ships to sea. Every ship must have its full complement of officers. The handling of a ship is a most responsible task. Every member of the crew must play his part if the ship is to reach its destination with safety to its crew and with its cargo intact. The maritime unions object to giving to any authority the right to say that a ship may sail without its full complement. It is a dangerous provision. Honorable members on the Government side should consider this matter very seriously indeed, because it is possible that cargoes owned by some of their very wealthy supporters may be seriously endangered if a ship goes to sea without its full complement. One can just imagine what would happen if a ship went on the rocks or sank because its crew was under strength. In those circumstances what may be the property of David Jones Limited might go to Davey Jones's locker! All these matters must be considered very carefully. </para>
                <para>I realize that cargoes and property may be fully insured, but we must not lose sight of the fact that every care must be taken to ensure the safety of the members of the crew. There could be serious accident, or people could lose their lives simply because a ship went to sea undermanned. For those reasons, the Opposition says that it is essential that a ship be fully manned. Although the Minister in charge of the bill is Minister for Air, I understand that he was once a seaman. I ask him whether a submarine, for instance, could be taken safely to sea without a full complement even though the captain were willing to allow it to put to sea. Would the Minister himself allow a submarine to be taken to sea with fewer than the number of men he knew was necessary to carry out the work with safety? </para>
                <para>Why does not the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> support this clause? He knows only too well that it cannot be supported with justification for he agrees that any one who knows anything about ships, the sea or sailing, knows that no ship can be taken to sea safely without its full complement of men. I repeat that the maritime unions object to the measure. We on this side of the chamber know that the measure has been introduced without any consultation with those who know anything about shipping. Honorable members opposite also know that to be a fact. I am confident that they also realize that this provision will revolutionize the operations of the act, if I may use that term, to the detriment of the members of the maritime unions. </para>
                <para>The measure was introduced in a twelveminute speech, and to-night, the Minister, when endeavouring to explain why he rejects the Opposition's proposed amendment, made the surprising statement that as a similar amendment was debated in the Senate the honorable member for East Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition are not entitled to any answer here. What is the true reason for the Government's proposal? It cannot be argued that because of shortage of man-power it is necessary that ships be allowed to go to sea with fewer than a full complement, thus endangering the lives of those who go to sea in them. Nor can it be said that the provision is essential in order to save money. I join with members on this side of the chamber in strongly criticizing the provision under discussion, and I support the proposal for its deletion. </para>
                <para>Honorable members opposite should explain, fully and clearly, why they are not prepared to insist that all ships shall be manned by competent personnel, in adequate numbers. I am not interested in what Country party members, who are interjecting, say about the sea. They are, so to speak, more at sea on that subject than on any other. It is significant that members of the Country party sit here, interjecting or yabbering, as the case may be, but rarely, on an issue such as this, in which the lives of men are involved, do they make a practical contribution to the debate. </para>
                <para>As I have said, I support the amendment that has been proposed. I hope that the Minister will give a more adequate explanation of the Government's attitude to this amendment than the explanation that he gave a few minutes ago of its attitude to another amendment. I hope that he will give at least an indication that the Government thought of the things that the Opposition has mentioned, and that he will not flippantly dismiss the amendment as having been discussed in another place. </para>

                    <para>.- This provision is somewhat, but not greatly, different from a provision which is already in. the act and which has been utilized for many years on the Australian coast. I refer the committee to sub-section (8.) of section 43 of the act. That sub-section specifically authorizes the taking of a ship to sea with not less than four-fifths of the engine-room staff, and four-fifths of the deck complement. That is not exactly the provision contained in sub-section (7.) of proposed section 14, but it is near enough to it. There is really nothing very new in what is being proposed. There is no reason why the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> or other members should become excited about a practice that has been applied satisfactorily around the coast of Australia for many years. </para>

                    <para>. - The Merchant Service Guild of Australasia, which is the organization of ships' officers serving on the Australian coast, is as responsible a body, and a body as careful in its utterances, as any other of which I know in Australia. Notwithstanding the point made by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske),</inline> this organization has indicated, as the member for East Sydney said, its opposition to this provision. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I think that there has been indifference on the part of the Government to the subject of safety at sea. I have had a long correspondence with the responsible Minister about the kind of rafts carried on ships, and about automatically inflatable rafts which can be used in circumstances when boats cannot be lowered, such as when a ship is capsizing. While that correspondence was going on, a ship was lost outside Sydney. Most of the crew were drowned because the boats could not be lowered. </para>
                <para>Lloyd's of London are still paying out each year on 200 ships of over 500 tons which are lost at sea. They are quite big ships. In spite of the technical advances in shipping, we have not reached the stage that shipwrecks or losses of ships at sea are not common. The Merchant Service Guild feels that it is important that a ship should have its full complement of officers to take the watches and to act in a crisis, and that there should be greater safeguards than there are in the measure. I am prepared to take notice of the members of that guild. They are men with great experience of operating ships on the Australian coast. I feel that we are entitled to a better explanation on this matter than we have been given. </para>

                    <para>-I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for East Sydney. I think that we on this side are more concerned about this amendment than about any of the other amendments. This provision gives permission for a port authority to allow a ship to sail -from any of the harbours on our coastline, in any weather, at any time of the year, with a full cargo or otherwise, although not fully manned. Sub-section (7.) of proposed section 14 states, among other things -  the Deputy Director or the proper authority, as the case may be, may, by writing under his hand, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, consent to the master taking the ship to sea from the port without the officer or officers of that description not obtained. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">There is a reference to " officers " - in the plural. If there were just one officer less, the position might not be quite so serious, but the provision gives permission for the proper authority to allow a ship to go out with more than one officer short. We are getting into dangerous waters indeed. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske)</inline> referred to a provision in the act making it permissible for a ship to sail with four-fifths of its crew. I wonder whether authority would be given for an aircraft to take off from any aerodrome in Australia with only four-fifths of its crew aboard. </para>

                <para>The position is more serious for ships, which have rougher passages than aircraft. Modern aircraft can get above storms or fly around them. The men who man the ships which sail in the race from Sydney to Hobart every year would never think of leaving Sydney with one member of the crew short for the journey of 620 miles to Hobart. Why should the owners of ships be singled out for exemption from a requirement to have a full crew? Such an exemption would not be given in any other field of transportation. </para>
                <para>I cannot understand why the Minister for Air is not prepared to accept this amendment, despite what happened in another chamber. We have to rectify many of the things that are done by members in another place. I believe that this is one of the things that we should rectify. I believe that we should put this provision back on a proper footing. The Minister has no argument other than that this provision has already gone through the other House. The members there said " Yea " or " Nay " to it, and he says that we must do the same. That makes him a perfect rubber stamp for the Minister in the other place. Why should we act as a rubber stamp and just carry out the wishes of a gentleman in the other House? We are wasting our time and the Parliament's time. All of us would like to be home now, but we have been kept here, just to have the Minister for Air tell us what another Minister has said in another place. </para>

                    <para>. -  I always listen with respect to the views of the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> and were he still in the chamber I should give him an answer which I believe would satisfy him. He suggested to the committee that if this clause were passed the safety of ships would be endangered because they would be able to sail without the requisite complement of officers. But complements of officers are not fixed with regard to safety alone; they are fixed, among other purposes, to provide an adequate number of officers to work the ship on long voyages with reasonable ease, so that no single officer may be called upon to work unduly hard or for long hours. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This clause does hot suggest that every ship will sail on every voyage with less than the required complement of officers. However, it is undesirable, in everybody's interest, that a ship should be delayed on, say, a short journey. Take the case of a ship plying along the Australian coast and due to sail from Newcastle for its home port of Sydney - a voyage of only some hours. If the ship is one officer short, is it desirable that the vessel should be delayed at Newcastle while a junior officer is obtained to bring the complement up to the authorized figure? This clause enables the proper authority, the superintendent, when -satisfied about the circumstances, to -authorize the sailing of the ship with less than the required complement. The clause is perfectly reasonable. </para>
                <para>The arguments of other honorable members opposite seem to be based on the assumption that this legislation is new. It is not. A similar power was included in the 1952 act. This is a complicated measure but, as I understand it, the only difference between the 1952 act and the -bill on this issue is that the 1952 act -required that, before the proper authority could exercise his discretion and allow the ship to sail with less than the authorized complement, he had to satisfy himself that the master had made every effort, through "the local branch of the union, to obtain a replacement. That provision still applies to ships plying along the Australian coast, but has been deleted in relation to Australian ships when in foreign ports for the obvious reason that in a foreign port the union cannot be consulted. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister himself furnishes the strongest argument for the Government's acceptance -of the Opposition's amendment. We are not arguing that the provisions of the proposed section are any different from those contained in the 1952 act; we object to the provisions in the 1952 act. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske)</inline> implies that if sub-section 7 is deleted we will restore the 1952 position, but that is not so, because clause 12 repeals existing section 14 entirely. We could see to it that the new section 14 was inserted without sub-section 7. </para>

                <para>The Minister said that the fixing of a complement for a ship is not based purely on safety considerations. Let us accept the Minister's argument. He said that one of the reasons for the fixing of a certain complement was to ensure that sufficient officers were aboard to avoid an officer being obliged to work unduly long hours. What could endanger a ship more than the undue fatigue of an officer? What could be worse than an officer being on duty when he ought to be resting. Under-manning could place the safety of a ship in jeopardy. That is the opinion of the organization to which the honorable member for Fremantle referred, the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia. </para>
                <para>If some request comes forward from the seamen's union, this Parliament usually adopts the attitude, " That is a Communistdominated union, and therefore we must not consider what it puts forward ". But here is a request from the Merchant Service Guild, supported by every maritime organization. </para>
                <para>The Minister said that adequate safeguards were provided. Let us examine the safeguards. If the proper authority was a man who was competent to judge the situation and whose ability was recognized, there might not be any great danger, but the bill refers to the  deputy  director or the proper authority. Who is the proper authority? In a port the proper authority could be a customs officer. What would a customs officer know about the proper manning of a ship? Would he know the position better than the man in charge of the ship, the officers employed on the ship, and the men who sail the ship? Of course not! They are the men to judge whether the proper safeguards are provided. </para>
                <para>The Opposition, and the maritime organizations, regard this matter most seriously. The provisions we are now considering relate only to officers, but later we shall be discussing other provisions relating to crew members. Surely, when the complement of a ship is being determined, the matter is investigated very thoroughly. The complement having been fixed - a figure which I would regard as the minimum with which the ship could sail - why, under any consideration, should the ship sail with a smaller complement of officers? </para>
                <para>The Minister implied that if a ship's complement was short by one junior officer at some Australian port, the ship would be tied up and unable to make even a short journey to its home port. Nothing of the kind! The union is able always to supply replacements of that character and no difficulty would be experienced in obtaining a full complement. </para>
                <para>Should an occasion arise on which a ship's master was unable to obtain a replacement for a junior officer, surely the reasonable attitude would be for the officers to take the ship to sea if only a short journey along the Australian coast was involved; but the person to judge whether the ship should sail, surely, should not be perhaps a customs officer at a port who may be designated as a proper authority - a man who may never have been to sea and would not know what is involved in the handling of a ship. If there is to be a workable arrangement in operation along the Australian coast, there should not be any obligation under the act to take the ship to sea under certain conditions. The only occasion on which a ship carrying less than the full complement should be taken to sea is when there is agreement between the owners and the representatives of the maritime unions. If they agreed that it was reasonable to send a ship to sea under certain conditions, I would respect their decision. But I believe that the men best able to judge the position are those who have brought the case to this Parliament - the members of maritime unions. I prefer to accept their opinion rather than the opinion of the Government, the Minister or any of the alleged experts advising him. No man can be more efficient than the men who sail the ships along the coast and across the seas. </para>
                <para>It is unreasonable to suggest that this provision should remain in the act. It is a contradiction of the principle that a ship must have a full complement. The maritime unions have been fighting for this principle for a number of years, and they will continue to fight until they succeed. </para>

                    <para>.- There is nothing new in the proposal now before us. From what has been said by honorable members opposite one could gain the impression that the proposal has been brought before the House untried and, therefore, should be rejected. What is the truth of the matter? Who is the proper port authority? Let us suppose the authority happens to be a customs official. He is a man with a reputation at stake. He is the senior representative of the Navigation Branch, a man with great personal knowledge of the sea and a man of great experience in these matters. How many times has the situation arisen in the past in which a ship has put to sea with less than a full complement of officers and crew? There may be half a dozen occasions in one year. Yet this matter has assumed gigantic proportions. There has never been an accident at sea that has been attributable to a ship sailing with short complement. That surely is the proof that there is no danger in this. A ship with a short complement would sail only on a short voyage. Instances would occur only in cases of emergency, such as the sickness of an officer, when the recognized port authority used his common sense to see that the ship went to sea and completed its voyage. Is it necessary to hold up shipping in this country because the crew is one man short? </para>

This is just a matter of common, practical horse-sense, where the recognized port authority allows a ship to go to sea on a short voyage in order to complete its journey, there being no danger to any other ship or to the personnel of the particular ship that is short of its full complement. </para>

                    <para>. - The longer the debate on this bill continues the clearer it becomes that the Government has no answer to the Opposition's attitude to the bill. It is clear that the unions concerned have not been adequately consulted on these matters. In the opinion of the Government, nothing but its own view matters. Men of the same kind as those who constitute the Government opposed the introduction of the Plimsoll line. The Government places emphasis on profit rather than on working conditions and safety considerations for the crew. The Opposition places a premium on things other than profits. The. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Minister said that the provision we are discussing is not new. It does not matter whether it is old or new. As the honorable member for East Sydney has said, the principle of profit before safety and reasonable working conditions has been exposed on every occasion on which these matters have been under review in this Parliament. It was exposed by the Opposition in 1952 and will be the subject of further representations when this act is again reviewed. </para>
                <para>The Minister said that it is undesirable for a ship to be delayed. Of course, it is. But surely safety is the first factor to be considered. Does the Minister ever consider it likely that rather than conform to bare requirements in the staffing of a ship on some rare occasions it may be desirable to carry extra personnel? As is the case with big business representatives everywhere, the Government looks at these provisions as though it is essential to cater for only the bare necessities. The Government adopts the same attitude to union awards. It plumps for the bare necessities on every occasion. Which officers might be left behind? Would it be the radio operator? Is that considered a case in point? Would it be an engineer? Although I have never been to sea, I have had sufficient experience in these matters - I signed on on one occasion - to know the importance of the engineer at sea. I know that it is absolutely inconceivable that a ship, especially one with a small number of engineers, would put to sea leaving behind one half or one quarter of its engineering complement. Would a steward be left behind? Whether a steward is left behind or not is, perhaps, not important to honorable members opposite but we know that his absence would affect working conditions and the health of the ship's personnel. Such things must be taken into account. </para>
                <para>As the honorable member for East Sydney has said, the unions are not irresponsible. If they are consulted they will co-operate. It seems incredible that this Parliament can direct that a certain ship shall carry a stipulated crew, but that its direction can be countermanded simply because the ship's master goes to a particular officer in charge of a port and states that after making a reasonable effort he cannot obtain the necessary crew. The Opposition has made out a case in support of this amendment, and the Government should accept it. </para>

It was stated earlier to-night, and the statement was repeated by the honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson),</inline> that it was quite obvious that there had not been adequate consultation with the maritime unions regarding this legislation. I want to make it quite clear that however truncated the discussion of the bill in this chamber may be, it follows upon a very thorough investigation and discussion of the bill in another place. Although I know that the honorable member for East Sydney, who is in charge of the bill for the Opposition, drew a distinction between the two Houses earlier in the committee discussions, the fact is, as I am sure he will not deny, that once the Labour caucus takes its decisions on these matters, those decisions follow through whether the discussion proceeds in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. I think it is fair to assume that what was stated exhaustively and in considerable detail by representatives of the Labour party in another place represents the combined viewpoint of the Labour caucus and is being repeated here. </para>

The point I want to emphasize is that few bills coming before this Parliament could have received closer departmental and parliamentary consideration than this measure. It has been in the making over a period of about five years. In the last couple of years departmental attention has been concentrated upon it. I was a member of a Cabinet committee that went through the bill clause by clause, and close consideration has been given to it by a committee of Government supporters. In addition, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> and officers of his department have conferred directly with the maritime unions. </para>

                    <para>.- -It was not my intention to speak on this clause until the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> made his contribution. The Minister was at great pains to indicate that this clause, and the hill generally, had been considered by the unions concerned. But he does not go beyond the point that the unions bad considered the bill. The maritime unions have turned to the Australian Labour party for protection against legislation of this kind, and that is the very reason for our opposition to the bill. The fight against proposed section  14  is so strenuous because the unions are dissatisfied with it. They know the intentions of the Government and the shipowners, and because they know those intentions they have asked the Labour party, as a unified body of men, to protest, first of all, against this policy of sending ships to sea without their full complement of men. It is because the unions have approached the authorities mentioned by the Minister for Labour and National Service, and have had no satisfaction from them, that the honorable member for East Sydney has been called upon to lead the united band of Opposition members in this chamber in the fight against this bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I join wholeheartedly in the fight against the reduction of the size of crews when it comes to transport of any kind. In these days of modern transport, it is the general tendency on the part of the employers in all fields of transport to reduce the complement of men in charge of conveyances of all kinds. As a result, the fight is on between the management, on the one hand, and the workers, on the other, who are fighting to protect, first, what they regard as their rights, and secondly, their safety. The men on the waterfront know full well that this sort of thing does not stop with forms of land transport such as dieselelectric locomotives or one-man buses. It is not confined to any one field of transport. The employers in all fields of transport are trying to reduce crew complements. The seamen and those associated with them know that, with the adoption of modern means of engine control, day by day, and week by week, the employers are out to reduce the normal complement of officers on both coastal vessels and ships undertaking long sea voyages. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske)</inline> said that a provision in terms similar to those of proposed section 14 has been in the principal act for years, and that it has been good enough. Would he say to unions concerned with the safety of land transport that the things that have been done for years are good enough in these modern times? We know that modern trends of transport are imposing greater responsibilities on crews, because the size of crews is being reduced. </para>
                <para>I want to make it clear to the Minister for Labour and National Service that the Opposition takes the stand that it has taken in this committee because the unions concerned - not Communist unions, hut unions that are held in high regard by everybody who understands trade unionism in this country - have begged Labour members to fight this provision, even at this late stage, because it will permit ships to be taken to sea without a full complement of officers. Even the hidebound members in the Government ranks will find, in the course of the next few years, that the principle for which we are fighting in these days of modern transport is sound. It is supported by the unions, which take a just view, and are trying to do the right thing. </para>
                <para>What is happening in the United States of America to-day? Transport unions in that country that have not had to fight the management once in the last 50 years are to-day calling their members out on strike in opposition to this modern tendency to reduce crew complements. I repeat that this sort of thing does not stop with land transport. It extends into the maritime industry also. Safety measures that were good enough in 1948 and 1952 are not good enough in 1958, and there is an obligation on the Government to reject the idea that what was good enough in the past is good enough now. There is an obligation on the Government to recognize that, in these days of modern engineering developments, a full complement of crew must be at the controls of every kind of transport conveyance, whether on sea or on land, but particularly on the sea. </para>
                <para>It is for these reasons that we are taking this stand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> We know full well that modern developments in sea transport will result in a demand by the employers for smaller and smaller complements of officers. Further reductions of already inadequate complements will seriously prejudice the safety of both travellers and crews on the seas. Opposition members are proud to participate in the fight being waged by the trade unions to ensure that no longer will ships be sent to sea unless they carry the full complement of officers prescribed for the particular kind of vessel. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to make three short points in relation to proposed section 14. First, I wish to deal with the remarks made by the honorable member for East Sydney, who suggested that I had said that the old provision would be revived. I said nothing of the sort. In reply to the suggestion that this provision was something entirely new in the act, I said merely that it was not entirely new, and that there was already a very similar provision. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Secondly, I wish to deal with the suggestion of the honorable member for East Sydney that there is always a crew available. If there is always a crew available, this provision will never be availed of, because it is only when there is not a crew available and reasonable efforts have been made to obtain a full crew that this proposed section will have any force. So, if the honorable member's argument that there is always a crew available is a good argument, he need have no worries about this provision. </para>
                <para>Thirdly, I wish to deal with a point that has been made by certain honorable members, including the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison).</inline> Any one who listened to the honorable member would think that he was the only person in this world who had any virtue, and that everybody else, and particularly Government supporters in this chamber, had no thought for the safety of sailors. I throw any such suggestion back in the honorable member's teeth. He rushed in without looking at the bill or the principal act, as did every other Opposition member who has spoken. There is, in the act, complete provision for the safety of ships under the circumstances involved here, and that provision has always been in the act. Sections 207 and 208 provide that any person who takes a ship to sea in an unseaworthy condition is guilty of an offence, and that taking a ship to sea without a complement sufficient for safety shall constitute the taking to sea of an unseaworthy ship. So that full protection is provided, and always has been provided. </para>
                <para>The arguments of Opposition members have been merely a red herring drawn across the trail in an attempt to make political capital out of this matter, and they have been characterized by a complete failure to examine the provisions of the act. Opposition members have come into the chamber not knowing what the bill is about, and they have not hesitated to try to make political capital out of it. They have been guilty of a pretty poor show. </para>

                    <para>.- The Opposition is not trying to seek political capital out of this amendment. What we are trying to do is to obtain from the Government some information about the proposed section. We have asked  speaker  after  speaker  on the other side of the chamber to tell us who is to be the authority that will decide whether a vessel may proceed to sea. The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> tried to give us an explanation. He finished up by talking about who would not be left out of the crew, but he could not tell us who would be left behind. It is obvious that the Minister for Air, who is in charge of the bill, is unable to give us any information. He called on the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline> who usually knows the answers to such questions, but as the Minister did not know what had transpired earlier he was unable to furnish the information. The honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> suggested that it would be a good idea to bring the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> to the bar of this chamber to explain the section, because it is obvious that Ministers in this chamber do not know what it is about. </para>

Every one knows that a greater number of officers is taken to sea than is really required for the purposes of safety at any one time. What happens if an officer becomes ill at sea? It is an ageold custom of the sea that a vessel does not stand still until an officer gets well. The complement is always large enough to ensure that a vessel is able to return to port safely. All that is involved in the proposed sub-section is that a properly qualified official is to examine all the facts of the case and allow the ship to proceed to sea only when he is perfectly satisfied that its safety will not be endangered. The ball seeks to provide for an efficient shipping service, and there is every provision, as the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joske)</inline> said, to ensure the safety of vessels. Honorable members opposite, who have absolutely no knowledge of conditions at sea, are attempting to draw a red herring across the trail. </para>

                        <para>- If there were an outbreak of war, a considerable number of aliens who owe allegiance to other countries could be in important positions in what would be regarded as one of our armed services. In the event of an armed conflict, the mercantile marine is just as important to the defence of Australia as are the armed forces. It is essential that those serving in the mercantile marine should be either British subjects or naturalized British subjects. Proposed section 17 provides that, after a period of twelve months' continuous residence in the country, a person is eligible to obtain a certificate. That certificate would enable him to take command of vessels sailing around our coast or overseas. Obviously, a person with only twelve months' continuous residence would not qualify for naturalization. The proposed section does not require such a person at any time during his stay in Australia to become naturalized. He could remain here for the rest of his life and never bother, or even intend, to become naturalized, but he could still be employed in an important position in, or hold a certificate to sail, ships in the Australian mercantile marine. </para>

                <para>Previous debates on the Navigation Act show that it has always been regarded as an essential requirement that those engaged in the mercantile marine, either in command of vessels or serving in them, shall be British subjects or naturalized British subjects. This new principle should not be introduced. A person has only to remain in this country for the required, number of years to enable him to- take out a naturalization certificate. Having done that, he could then apply for a certificate under this legislation. Surely it would not be unduly harsh to require new settlers to live amongst us for a number of years and to prove their loyalty before they enjoy all the rights of Australian citizenship. In my opinion, that requirement would not inflict hardship on new arrivals. It is a necessary precaution, and is a principle that has been retained in this type of legislation. It should' not be departed from now. I hope that the amendment that I have moved will be carried by the committee. </para>

The certificate could be withdrawn by the Minister at a moment's notice. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with the honorable member for East Sydney in the criticism that he has levelled at this clause. The amendment that we propose would protect a long-standing tradition and principle in regard to the employment of British subjects. I see no reason why a person who desires to obtain a certificate under this provision should not be a naturalized British subject or a British subject by birth. When all is said and done, that is not a tremendous obligation to place on any citizen. As has been pointed out, those in the industry have always held the view that this principle should be maintained. </para>

                        <para>- I have read the bill and I have listened to a few of the Q.C.'s in this Parliament who are supposed to have read it, but I am still as mystified as ever. The honorable member for Fawkner said that clause 13 must be read in conjunction with clause 15. Who said that is so? Only the honorable member for Fawkner! There is nothing in the bill to say that that is so. Unfortunately the interpretation to be placed on the clause will not be the interpretation of the honorable member, but the interpretation of those who administer the legislation. He might just as well have said that this clause is to be read in conjunction with clause 165, or some other clause. Nothing in the bill says that clause 13 depends on clause 15 to function adequately. The honorable member gave no reason for his view, except to say that the clause said something about a British subject. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>If it  ls  as simple as that, why cannot the Government accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for East Sydney? Why can it not delete the words that we suggest should be deleted? If that weredone, the clause would provide that a person shall not be admitted to examination for &gt;. certificate unless he is a British subject. What is wrong with a simple clause such as that? The honorable member for Fawkner said, that that is the meaning of clause 15. If he is right, the words that we seek to have deleted are superfluous and the Government should remove them. </para>
                <para>What is wrong with a British subject? Is this provision a continuation of the Government's policy against the British people in this country? It has shown that policy in immigration and other spheres. Why does it discriminate against British people? There must be some ulterior motive. There must be something behind the Government's desire to retain the words that we want deleted. Does it want a few von Luckners to join our merchant marine? Does it want people in the merchant marine who, as the honorable member for East Sydney said, will be subversive in war-time? Does it want people who will be security risks? The Government ensures that security risks are not taken in other directions, but it is prepared to allow people who are not British subjects and who, in many instances, are not prepared to become British subjects to control our ships and occupy high positions in the merchant marine. We should not forget that in the last great war many people who had lived in allied countries for generations were subversive. If this clause is not amended in the way we have suggested, we will face the problem of subversion in our merchant marine should war break out in the future. </para>
                <para>I should like the Minister to explain the ulterior motives behind this clause. Why is the Government not prepared to accept our amendment? Having heard what the Minister had to say on a previous clause, I am not at all optimistic that he will have a satisfactory answer. I presume, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that this amendment has been debated in the Senate. I presume that the Minister will say that the Government examined the amendment in that place and decided not to accept it. But there are a number of matters which the Minister must necessarily deal with in answer to the criticisms that we have levelled at the Government in respect of the measure. It is not sufficient to say that one clause must be read in conjunction with another clause. It is not sufficient for the Minister just to give us a guarantee about something. What really matters are the provisions as written in the bill and as passed by this Parliament. The fact that the Government intends, in the face of opposition from the maritime unions, to allow the entry into the merchant marine of people who are not British subjects and, in fact, are not even naturalized, is something that the Government must attempt to defend if it intends to proceed with the proposal. ls the Government going to allow people who are neither nationals of this country nor naturalized British subjects to take ships to our northern waters to places where, during the last war, the Japanese had their domain? Is it prepared to allow the merchant marine of this country to be used by enemy forces, in an indirect way, to be turned over to our enemies, practically through sabotage, should the occasion arise? </para>
                <para>What is wrong, in the eyes of the Government with British merchant marine men? Why should not British people occupy these maritime positions in a dominion such as this? What is wrong with British mariners? I suppose that there is no greater collection of flag-wavers than the members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties; yet, when we on this side of the Parliament put forward a proposal designed to protect British seamen, designed to make our merchant marine really a potential part of our defence services, this Government, which says, " We stand behind the Throne and the Empire", refuses to accept an amendment to this measure, which affects our merchant shipping so closely. Let the able seamen of the Australian Country party and the ancient mariners who comprise the Government stand up and say in a few words why they are not prepared to accept the amendment submitted in good faith by the Opposition with the support of the maritime unions - an amendment which is supported by every person who believes in having carried out the services we require both in peace and time of war, free from the risk of sabotage. The amendment is designed to build up the merchant marine and its acceptance by the Government and inclusion in the measure would undoubtedly be of benefit to this country. </para>
                <para>So I support the submissions from this side of the Parliament, and I sincerely hope that the Government will see the wisdom of the amendment. When all is said and done, this is a matter above politics. Honorable members opposite may laugh if they like, but I say quite sincerely that this is a matter on which the lives of men depend. Honorable members opposite are the people who talk about loyalty. The things we have been dealing with are things in which we ought to believe irrespective of politics. We are discussing a great navigation bill to which we. as a Parliament, should have a broad national approach, not the narrow approach made by members of the Australian Country party and the ill-informed outlook of half of the Liberal members of the Parliament. We should have a broad national outlook on this matter such as is paramount on this side of the chamber. </para>
                <para>The Labour party's amendment, which has been submitted in good faith, should be adopted by the Government. I support the amendment, and I ask the Minister, who is sitting on one hand on the front bench to see whether he can give us something better than this provision under which British people are to be denied the right to serve in the merchant marine, a right which is to be given to those who have no allegiance to this country or to Great Britain. 1 believe the amendment ought to be adopted. I support it enthusiastically, and I look forward to its consideration by the Government, although I am not hopeful about the result. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson)</inline> was quite right when he said that this provision should be considered in relation to the proposed sections in clause 15. He could have added, for the benefit of the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> that it ought to be considered in relation to clause 1 5 if anybody is to have an intelligent understanding of its meaning. The purpose of the provisions of this clause, and of clauses 14 and 15, is to enable immigrants in Australia who are qualified, able and suitable people and who are mariners, to progress in their profession. I find it strange that members of the Labour party adopt an attitude so restrictive of the progress of new citizens in Australia as is exhibited in their amendment. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It has been stated that the provision is unnecessary. I shall explain the purpose of it. As the law stands, no seaman may be admitted to examination leading to appointment as deck officer or engineer unless he is a British subject, natural-born or naturalized. That means that a new Australian seaman cannot progress in his profession until he becomes naturalized. The Opposition knows as well as I do that, in ordinary circumstances, a new Australian citizen must live in this country for five years before he may become naturalized. That means that a young nonBritish seaman who has come to Australia as an immigrant cannot take even the first steps that lead to appointment as an officer before he has waited for rive years, after which he may be naturalized. Is that in accord with what used to be the Opposition's attitude to the immigration policy? ls it fair to new Australian seamen? </para>

                        <para>- Why? Because that would mean that for that five years they could not even start up the ladder to appointment as officers. This proposed section, and the proposed sections in the next two clauses, provide that a new Australian may be admitted to examination without being a British subject. Subsequent provisions state that if he passes his examinations he cannot be granted a certificate, for some of the reasons that members of the Opposition have put forward; but he can be granted a permit which will allow him to be employed on an Australian ship as a junior officer. The honorable member for Grayndler asked whether such people were to be allowed to take our ships to northern waters. He obviously did not bother to read the bill thoroughly, or he would know that the holder of a permit may not captain an Australian ship. He may hold only a junior position as a deck officer or engineer. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Furthermore, something was said about what is to happen in the event of war and possible subversion. I point out that a permit issued under the terms of this measure can be withdrawn immediately at any time such action is considered proper. There are complete safeguards in the bill It simply provides an adequate arrangement under which a new citizen of this country can pass his examination and progress up the ladder of promotion without having to wait five years and become naturalized before he can even put his foot on the first rung. </para>
                <para>T think it was the honorable member for East Sydney who asked why such people should not become naturalized. He said they might go on for twenty years without seeking naturalization. The inducement for them to become naturalized is that they cannot get the full foreign-going certificate in the merchant marine until they do become naturalized. Further, until they have become naturalized, they cannot be granted a certificate, but only a permit which will allow them to serve on a coastal run  in  junior positions. The inducement to become naturalized is also that they cannot take senior positions on ships, cannot be masters, mates, I think, or chief engineers, until they are naturalized and therefore eligible to get full certificate. </para>
                <para>I think that the safeguards in the legislation are ample. The purpose of the proposed section is clear, and it is strange that I should have to give information on this subject to members of the Opposition, who may be interested to know that in the Senate the principles of these provisions were accepted by the Opposition. The only argument in the Senate was about the machinery provisions of the bill. </para>

Once he obtains a permit and is working on a ship, the inducement to become naturalized will exist only if he desires to be promoted.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> based his argument on an entirely wrong premise. When one analyses carefully what the honorable member said, it is quite apparent that the view that he expressed is antagonistic to the immigration policy. We on this side of the chamber will not stand for the coercion of new Australians to become naturalized. We are encouraging them - and I trust that the Opposition will adopt a similar attitude - to choose, of their own free will, to become fully naturalized citizens of Australia. Although we could not possibly agree to the amendment proposed by the Opposition, if it were adopted, the effect would be to hold back the qualified young fellow who came from overseas with experience of seamanship, for a period of five years before he would be permitted to take any part at all in his calling. </para>

                <para>We are making provision so that, provided that he has been in the country for a period of twelve months, is qualified and can speak and write our language with reasonable fluency, he may sit for the examination, and if he passes it, obtain a permit. The only restriction then will be, as the Minister has said, that he will not be able to assume full responsibility while holding a certificate of competency. The point that we want to stress is that we are here providing a true incentive, for the man who has a permit, to move on towards full naturalization. This is the type of incentive that we think we should provide at every possible point when we are handling new Australians and encouraging them to seek naturalization, which we so readily offer. </para>
                <para>This matter was clearly expressed in the second-reading speech of the Minister. It would appear to me that quite a number of honorable members on the other side of the chamber simply have not followed, by intelligent reading, the Minister's speech, nor have they looked at the bill that is before us. In the course of the speech, the Minister said - </para>

On the other hand, there is no reason why such men should not serve in local ships; and to enable them to do so, on their establishing their qualifications, it is proposed to issue them with permits which can be exchanged for foreign-going certificates when they become naturalized. </para>

                    <para>.- The longer this debate proceeds, the more obvious it becomes that neither the Minister nor any supporter of the Government knows anything about it. Let us examine what Government supporters have said. It has been stated that, under this provision, after twelve months' residence in this country new Australians may sit for the examination. Then they could not get a certificate, but only a permit, and the permit only permitted them to act in a minor capacity. They could not be in charge of a vessel. Honorable members will recollect the Minister emphasizing that, and now it has been repeated by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cleaver).</inline> According to the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson),</inline> we should consider clause 13 in relation to clause 15. Let us take clause 15 from which the honorable member quoted sub-section (2.) of proposed section 18a. I shall read that sub-section to the committee and then ask honorable members whether it does not mean what I say it means, and not what the Minister has said it means. First, I shall read sub-section (1.) of proposed section 18a, so that honorable members may better follow the matter; it reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That is, if they are not British subjects -  a person would be eligible for a certificate as extra master or master of a foreign-going ship, the Minister may grant to that person a permit <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> serve as master of a foreign-going ship regis tered in Australia and, for the purposes of this Act, the holder of such a permit shall, in relation to a ship so registered, be deemed to be the holder of a certificate as master of a foreigngoing ship. </para>
                <para class="block">What does that mean, if it does not mean what I have said it means? It could refer to a person who had been in this country for twelve months. It is not a question of placing him in a minor position in which he can follow his usual occupation. This provision enables the Minister to grant to that person a permit to be in charge of a foreign-going vessel. I suggest that honorable members opposite should study the bill. If they did they might know something about it. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Fawkner said that there is no danger from a security Viewpoint because these permits can be revoked by the Minister. I understood him to say that that could be done under subsection (3.); but just to put him on the right track, I point out that sub-section (5.) gives the Minister that power. What protection is that? Assume a ship is at sea in the charge of an alien, a man who has no allegiance to this country but owes allegiance to a foreign power. What do you do? Do you send him a radio-telegram to return, that war has been declared? Do you request, or direct, him to return to port? If he is an enemy alien and has no allegiance to this country, is he likely to obey such a direction? Is the honorable member for Fawkner so naive as to believe that that would happen? I am not trying to deprive anybody of an opportunity to earn a livelihood when he comes to this country to make it his land of adoption, but we must be realistic and sensible about these things. I think it is a most serious thing in this context to provide for only twelve months' residence in this country. We have our security checks, I understand, of the people who arrive in this country. I have criticized the method by which security checks have been made, on the ground that they have been political checks. But there are checks made by security - and quite rightly so - when people arrive in this country. However, it is also true that the system is not perfect, and there have been many instances in which people who have held high positions in the Nazi organization m Germany have sneaked through the security screen. Under this provision, they must be in the country for twelve months, pass the examination, and when they are given a permit or a certificate they are allowed to command a ship. </para>
                <para>The point I am making is that whether it is a certificate or a permit, the danger is the same. What do you do in the event of war occurring? As the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has pointed out, there are many people in this country who have not applied for naturalization. It may be that many have merely neglected to apply for naturalization. But in this instance, if you are going to give a person an opportunity to command a ship in the Australian merchant marine, you do not even have to ask him if he intends to become naturalized. He could be here for the rest of his life and need never become a British subject. As long as he holds a certificate or a permit he may be the master of a foreign-going vessel in the Australian mercantile marine. There is nothing unreasonable about what the organizations are asking for, and what the Australian Labour part is asking for. We urge the Government to take a natural precaution, which would not place a tremendous hardship on new Australians, because they can go into some other occupation temporarily until they can qualify. Does the British Medical Association allow immediately every medical person who arrives in this country to become a member of the association and practice? Yet, honorable members plead that it is wrong to deny these people an opportunity to work at their profession. Unquestionably, many professional men from overseas have been obliged to take labouring jobs on the Snowy works and elsewhere throughout Australia because the various professional organizations would not admit them to membership. They say, " Let them deserve their membership in this country. Let them prove they are qualified. Although they hold overseas certificates, let them show they are up to Australian standards ". </para>
                <para>That is what the maritime unions are asking in this instance - that these people remain in the country until they have been here sufficiently long as Australian citizens to qualify for a certificate of naturalization. When they get that and can prove they have the qualifications to act as a master in the Australian mercantile marine, the way is open. This new principle that has been introduced is a dangerous one and I think that the Minister should examine it. The immigration policy has nothing whatever to do with keeping the mercantile marine service, which is a most important organization in the defence services of this country, in charge of people who have at least sworn allegiance to Australia and have British nationality. This is a most reasonable request by the Opposition, and I join with the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> and other honorable members who have supported it. I say that this is an amendment which the Opposition supports enthusiastically. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not want to detain the committee, but I think the Opposition's argument is based completely on false premises. I do not agree with this clause entirely, but I approach it in quite a different way. I, personally, do not think it goes far enough, for this reason: I do not think it gives sufficient encouragement to highly qualified new Australians to enter the merchant service which is, as . 1 am reminded, a magnificent service. Provided these new Australians can pass their examinations, provided they can qualify, and provided they comply with all the requirements of this bill, as qualified officers and men in the merchant service, they should be given every encouragement to join that service. Do not let us forget that Australia does not recognize any foreign qualifications of seamen; they have to do all their examinations again. They are admitted - as the Minister has reminded us - to the merchant service on the basis of second mate and they have to go through their entire examinations and gain all the qualifications again, although in their own country they might have the highest qualifications. So, there is no danger of diluting the merchant service with inefficient or ineffectual people. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>How can we encourage new Australians to accept Australian citizenship? The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> has discretion to shorten the period in respect of residence provided a new Australian shows good cause. If a new Australian has an opportunity of getting employment provided he is an Australian citizen, and if he can show good reason, at the Minister's discretion, his period of residence can be shortened. This surely is a case where the Minister's discretion can be exercised. Also, in cases where new Australians served with the British forces during the war, their period of residence may be shortened. They have to have only two years' residence in this country to enable them to become Australian citizens. This seems to be an excellent opportunity for new Australians to go into the merchant service provided they do our examinations. Provided they do that and they have sufficient qualifications, I think the Minister should shorten the period of residence so that they can become Australian citizens. That should remove entirely the objections of the Opposition. </para>

                <para class="block">The Opposition recognizes that the same principle is involved in these proposed subsections as in those that we have already debated. We do not propose to delay the committee by going into a lengthy discussion and developing the argument that we have already advanced, but I direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that the Minister himself has admitted to me that his interpretation of proposed section 18a (2.) was incorrect. The interpretation that I gave concerning this provision was the correct one. Therefore. I believe that the Minister should indicate to the committee that he was in error. By the argument that he developed in contradiction to that advanced by me, the Minister led the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson)</inline> and the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> to take a similar line to his in the debate. That goes to prove that many of the Government's supporters recorded their votes against the Opposition amendment without understanding what was involved in the provisions of the bill. </para>
                <para>The amendment involves the same principle as the previous amendment. The Opposition will not force this amendment to a division, but we reaffirm our opposition to the principle that is involved. Finally, I repeat that I believe that the Minister misled the committee and so influenced the vote on the last division. I do not think that he did so deliberately. I think he made an honest mistake, but he did wrongly interpret the provisions of the bill. </para>

                <para>The Opposition has no great objection to this provision except in respect of the amendment that I have moved. The attitude of the maritime unions is that they welcome into their ranks and their industry men who have qualifications which they have obtained as a result of their naval training, but it was pointed out, particularly by the engineers, that there are no big diesel engines in ships of the Royal Australian Navy. If the proposed section is allowed to stand, a man could be admitted to and obtain a certificate to serve in themercantile marine as master of a foreign-going ship or as an engineer when in fact he had not satisfied the authorities that he bad obtained the necessary experience or had the necessary qualifications. Any applicants who are ex-naval personnel will be welcomedby the maritime unions into their organization if they can prove that they have the necessary qualifications. The maritime unions will raise no objection, but they do request that this provision be made in the measure so that the applicants must first of all prove their qualifications. </para>

                <para class="block">The officers' organization, the Merchant Service Guild, is very much concerned about this provision. Tt asks that the words " in respect of foreign-going ships " be added because it believes that only a person from the United Kingdom who holds a foreign-going certificate should be recognized under this section. The organization states that the bill, in its present form, would enable a person holding what is known as a United Kingdom home trade certificate - the equivalent of an Australian coastal trade certificate - to operate on the Australian coast. It is claimed .that both a knowledge of our coast and an acquaintance with local safety provisions are needed and that the acceptance of a United Kingdom home trade certificate in those circumstances might easily have disastrous results. Members of the guild ask that the existing conditions be liberalized only in respect of persons holding foreigngoing qualifications. They believe that holders of United Kingdom home trade certificates should have to satisfy Australian authorities that they have the necessary knowledge of our coastal conditions. This amendment, which is reasonable and proper, is prompted by a desire to maintain the safety of our coastal shipping. It should be adopted by the committee. </para>

The argument .of the Merchant Service Guild overlooks the words, " which corresponds with a certificate of competency or a certificate of service under .this Division ", in proposed new section 22. Those words make it plain that a United Kingdom certificate will be acceptable only if it corresponds with the local certificate. The application of the home trade certificate of the United Kingdom is restricted in a geographical sense. It covers operations i.n the North Sea and the English Channel only. In the circumstances, it cannot correspond with a certificate under the division referred to and the fear that it will be accepted locally is groundless. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am indebted to the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> for his explanation of the reason for the amendment, which I had found somewhat puzzling. The sub-section to which he objects merely legalizes the existing practice. Section 29 is an old section which had its origin in the need to protect seamen against crimps and boarding house keepers who might have them shanghaied off to sea. The section provided that seamen should be supplied by certain persons only. In these days seamen are almost invariably supplied by an officer of the seamen's organization. The Government believes that, in the absence of proposed sub-section (1.) the existing practice is illegal. Substance is given to my argument by the 1955 award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster, which makes the union responsible for supplying seamen.  His  Honour added that such old sections of the act as might have reference to the union supplying seamen were quite unworkable. Undoubtedly, the sub-section to which objection is taken does no more than legalize the existing practice. I do not agree with the honorable member for East Sydney that it imposes an obligation. I repeat, it merely gives the union a right. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not wish to delay the committee, but would suggest that the Minister read section 63 of the 1955 award. It relates to the engagement of crews of vessels. The proposal before us is not strictly in accordance with that award provision. Argument on the matter has been put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster and he has declared himself in favour of the union viewpoint. That would seem to contradict what the Minister has said. He should read the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster when this matter was put to him by the organization. If  His  Honour is found to confirm what I have said the proposal before us will be clearly in conflict with the award and the award ought to be maintained. It is wrong in principle for a government to attempt, by way of legislation, to over-ride the provisions of an award. If seamen are expected to negotiate an award, which is really a contract between employer and employee, and to observe it, surely it should be equally observed by the Government and the shipowners as well. According to my advice, the court has already decided in favour of the union's viewpoint. The Government should accept that viewpoint. </para>

                <para class="block">The same principle is involved in this clause as that which related to the undermanning of ships by officers, and which we discussed and voted against. This proposed section deals with the other groups of crew members. The same arguments apply, but I direct the attention of the committee to what may be regarded as an additional argument why undermanning should not be permitted. It is provided that, with the approval of a deputy director or the proper authority, a ship may be taken to sea if it has at least four-fifths of the engine room staff or four-fifths of the deck complement. The engine room staff does not consist merely of engineers. It includes greasers and a number of other types of employees. If , a master of a ship can satisfy a deputy director or the proper authority that he has on board, hot the full complement, but four-fifths of the engine room staff, he can take the ship to sea, although the one-fifth who are absent may be all engineers. </para>
                <para>That situation could arise. The ship could go to sea fully manned with greasers, seamen and other types of employees, but lacking the proper complement of engineers. In the opinion of the organizations concerned, this would place an undue strain and responsibility upon the restricted number of engineers sailing with the ship. This would mean that they would have to work unnecessarily long hours and would suffer from fatigue. As a result, the organizations regard this as a completely objectionable provision. The engineers join with the officers in their objection to the earlier provision. The representatives of the organization covering the men affected by this provision strongly object to the provision, as they have objected over a period of years. It is of no use for Government supporters to say that this provision has been in the legislation and that no protest has been made. What do they want to happen? Do they want the seamen to hold the ships up by refusing to take them to sea unless they have a fullcomplement? Is that the way Government supporters want the men to record their protests? </para>
                <para>These organizations have been pressing for the elimination of this provision from the act ever since I can remember. They have always objected to going to sea without a full complement. If the Government adopts the attitude that, because it has received recently no direct protests from the organizations, there is no complaint against these provisions, and if the Government wants objections registered in a more practical and understandable form it would not be very difficult to organize a stoppage amongst the seamen and other members of the crews of these vessels to impress the Government. That may be the only way to impress the Government with the fact that the organizations regard these matters very seriously. They have long desired these changes to be effected in the legislation. If the Government is going to be obdurate and refuse to meet the wishes of the men working the ships, whatever troubles arise in the future will be the responsibility of the Government itself. </para>

The first is that under the present law the articles are all in the same form and a copy of the articles is posted on the ship's notice board. The second is that the agreement is not an individual agreement between the shipowner and each seaman, but is a single agreement to which all of the seamen subscribe their names. The amendment is not necessary. </para>

                    <para>. -  The explanation is that the ship's load line certificate is produced when the major crew is engaged. When a single man is engaged, in a port which is not his home port, as a replacement for a member of the crew the position is that the articles have already been produced in the superintendent's office. Those articles record the fact that the load line certificate was produced at the time the articles were entered into. It would therefore be an unnecessary waste of time if this provision were inserted. </para>

                    <para>. -  There are two objections to this proposed amendment. The first is that the allotment of wages is made by agreement between the person who pays the wages and the person who receives them. The person who pays is the master, as the agent of the shipowner, and the seaman is the person who receives the wages. The allotment note is an agreement between them and should be signed by them. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The second objection is that if the amendment were accepted it would be possible for a seaman to go ashore and sign an allotment note with the superintendent. It is quite possible that a seaman would, by design or, more probably, through error, allot more than his wages or more than a reasonable proportion of them. The superintendent would not have information available as to the seaman's existing allotments. </para>

                    <para>. - This section of the act is the one that provides how a seaman's wages are to be paid. It provides, in effect, that his wages - meaning his wages without the addition of any overtime or any other extra payment - shall be paid fortnightly, on the 1st and 15th days of each month, and that the extra payments shall be made a fortnight later. If the Opposition's amendment were accepted, the effect would be that, in addition to a seaman's fixed wages, overtime and other extra payments would have to be paid fortnightly at the same time as the wages. It is not practicable for the ships' staff and the staff in the office of the owner or agent to work out every fortnight the amount of a seaman's overtime. I am informed that the accounting already involved in working out the overtime for a ship's crew is considerable, and that to impose an obligation to complete the extra accounting within the fortnight would place an undue strain on the ship's staff or the agent's officers. The seaman is not being denied anything. His basic rate of wages is settled and these wages can satisfactorily be paid each fortnight, or when the ship comes into harbour, in accordance with the present practice. Under existing procedure, the seaman then has to wait another fortnight while his overtime is worked out. The Government's view is that to accept this amendment would be to place an undue strain on the accounting staff involved, and that the amendment, therefore, should not be accepted. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a most important matter, which the union has been trying to adjust for some considerable time. There has been a great deal of disputation as to what actually constitutes a seaman's home port. This has an important bearing on claims for compensation, because under the provisions of the various awards and of the act, if a seaman is injured or falls ill away from what is regarded as his home port, his medical costs - and surgical costs if an operation is required - are paid, and he is maintained and his wages paid until he is declared cured and returned to his home port. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the unions are concerned about this aspect of the matter. I agree that the difficulty arises also in respect of other clauses, but the unions believe that this clause also is involved. The union viewpoint is that the words of engagement would be preferable to the proposed " at which he commences work". The unions say that a man may be engaged in one port and may commence work in another. It wants to establish beyond doubt that it is the time of engagement that counts and not the time at which the seaman commences work. I believe there is some merit in the submission of the trade union representatives. </para>

                    <para>. - The Opposition proposes an amendment of clause 25, which deals with section 82 of the principal act. That section is the one which determines when a seaman's right to wages commences. The Government proposes to provide that the seaman's right to wages will commence at either the time at which he commences work, or at the time specified in his agreement for his commencement of work or presence on board, whichever is the earlier. The Opposition's amendment would provide that his right to wages would begin at the time of engagement. That represents a considerable alteration of the existing practice. If a seaman is not required immediately upon engagement, it is quite usual for him to say that he will be ready the next day, after which he goes away and joins the ship on the following day. It is a very common practice. In fact, I understand that it is the usual thing for a seaman, after signing on, to wish to go home to collect his belongings. The Government sees no reason to disturb the existing practice and therefore rejects the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the Minister when he says that I confused this amendment with a later one. The Minister is correct in saying that it involves the question of the point of time at which the pay of a seaman commences. The unions are of the opinion that the pay should commence from the time of engagement and not from the time that the seaman commences work. They argue that once a man is engaged for work he is obviously ineligible for employment elsewhere. He is actually in the employ of the company and from that point, if he is given a .direction to report on board ship for duty at some later period, he is then prevented from accepting other employment. He should be regarded as the company's employee and his pay should commence from the time of engagement. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That is a common practice in industry. If a person seeks engagement in a factory and -is successful his period of employment starts immediately and he is paid from that point of time. There is no suggestion that this amendment introduces a new principle in the employment of seamen which is not followed in ordinary industry. The request is a reasonable one and I press for the acceptance of the amendment. </para>

The provision under consideration deals with an industrial matter which should be handled by an arbitral authority that has the specific functions of laying down wages and conditions of employees. This sort of provision might have been all right in 1912 when this act first commenced and before there was any arbitration machinery such as now exists. It seems entirely wrong that when arbitration authorities have been set up to make awards which lay down the wages and conditions of employees, this Parliament should cut across the functions of those authorities by providing these matters in legislative enactments. Surely the time has come when provisions of this sort should be completely removed from the act and the judges of the arbitration tribunals allowed to exercise their function fully! </para>

No one can tell me that any common rule can be laid down for .every port or for every seaman as to when his pay .period shall commence. This is a matter which should be determined by the courts. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument put forward by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. "Harrison)</inline> is worthy of favorable consideration because the amendment has an important bearing on a seaman's right to pay from a certain period. The bill proposes that he should be paid from the time that he commences work, but the Opposition is asking that the pay period commence from the 'time of his .engagement. The honorable member for Blaxland &gt;who is a trade unionist of wide experience, has pointed out that this lis a matter which .might well come within the scope of an award. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Government should have cleared up this matter before the hill was drafted and brought to 'Parliament. What is wrong with paying a man from the time of engagement? From the moment he is engaged, he is stopped from taking any other form of employment and if he has to stand or sit around for two or three days before the .actually commences -work, he should .be paid for that time. I (understand 'that that is the accepted practice in any industry, so why make a difference in regard to seamen? A .provision of this kind clearly shows that the Government did .not consult the people who know most about seamen's wages and working conditions, that is the maritime unions. </para>
                <para>The Government has seen fit to be mandatory on this -point and as the '-honorable member for Blaxland has pointed out, Jit may find itself in .difficulties .because the court might not :be so mandatory. Members -of the .Opposition support the &gt;view of &gt;the maritime unions that a seaman's wages should commence from the time of his engagement. This is an important matter. 1 have here a letter from a seaman which I received only a few days ago. It comprises several pages and on each page the writer gives examples of penalties that can be imposed on him as a .result of his being paid from the time he commences duty instead of from the time of his engagement. I shall not read the letter but ask permission of the committee to have it incorporated in " Hansard ". He is working on a ship. I have the name of the ship, and I am prepared to have this letter incorporated in " Hansard ". If leave is not granted, I do not .mind taking up the time of the committee in quoting it .word for word, either now or later. This letter is a practical example of what .can happen. It sets out his wages, .and the figures can be verified from the company. It also sets out what he will lose if the provision under consideration becomes law in its .present form. It sets out what he .would lose between the time of his engagement .and the time he commences work. </para>
                <para>I know that honorable members look favorably upon the presentation of objective views -on these matters. I know that the Minister for Labour and National Service is in favour of hearing objective views, and the letter which I seek to incorporate in " Hansard " certainly gives such a view.. I ask leave .to have .it incorporated in " Hansard " .as an indication to the Government .of .a practical man's view of the need to reconsider this clause. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that the Minister has taken that attitude, because I was prepared to give the name of the person concerned and all the facts relating to his position. It may not be the general practice to incorporate such documents in " Hansard ", but I suggest that there always comes a time when we should break away from what has been the custom. After all, the Government is doing that by this clause in that it is altering the commencing time of a man's payment from the time of engagement to the time when he commences work. The fact that the Minister is not prepared to accept this man's statement illustrates that the Government is afraid of the submissions we are making and therefore refuses to accept proof of what we say. Honorable members know that I have not the time at my disposal to read the letter. It requires emphasis, and that cannot be done in a few minutes. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This is the general policy of the Government. By legislation such as this, it is causing dissatisfaction in industry. As the honorable member for East Sydney said earlier, there may be a number of hold-ups eventually because of the Government's failure to give consideration to the views of persons such as the seaman who wrote the letter to which I have referred and others who know all about a particular industry because they work in it. In any case, it is not of much use according members of the Australian Country party an opportunity to read the letter because not many of them can read. They would need to have it explained to them word by word. Actually, the members of the Country party are the severest critics of this clause. Not one of them has endeavoured to read the bill, yet they are endeavouring to prevent my having incorporated in " Hansard " a letter which deals fully with this particular matter. Let it be recorded, however, that I offered to give to the committee a statement by a seaman of the amount of money he would lose under the provision proposed by the Government and that the Minister for Labour and National Service has refused to accept this proof of the validity of our proposed amendment. </para>

                        <para>-  I shall not comment further on it. The amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition by the honorable member for East Sydney should be accepted. It is evident at this stage that the submissions made by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> will not be considered. He has suggested that the Government should review the matter and ascertain what is judicial - what should go to the court and what should be decided by the court. We are seeking to ensure that the seamen shall get from the operation of this bill the benefits to which they are entitled and which have become an established practice in the industry. These men sign a contract to work on a certain date. They may have to wait for a week, a fortnight, or perhaps only a day to take up that engagement, but the Government would keep them idle during that time. I should not be surprised if it disqualified them from participation in unemployment benefit on the ground that they can be deemed to be in work. </para>

                <para>It is all very well for capitalists and squatters like the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> to say that it does not matter.

It matters to seamen just as much as it does to other employees, and it is a disgrace to any section of this Parliament that an attempt such as this should be made to take a few pence from the men's wages to bolster up the rising capital investment and huge profits of the employers in this industry. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Minister will give consideration to our proposal and that he will not reject out of hand the submissions made by the honorable member for East Sydney and other honorable members on this side of the Parliament who believe that the wages of the seamen should commence on the date on which they are engaged. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to direct attention to the drastic penalties that may be imposed arbitrarily upon ^workers in the maritime industries. In actual fact, the seamen are asked to enter into an agreement under which they agree to accept certain penalties should they be found guilty of certain offences. In the -cases envisaged by this group of clauses, the master becomes the person who charges, tries, convicts and imposes the penalty. </para>

                <para>I direct attention to the severity of the penalties suggested.

                        <para>-  But the master is the person who takes action against the seaman in the first place. The master has power, under certain conditions, to impose penalties, and we say that those penalties are too severe. I have already indicated that a person who overstays his leave by 48 hours or more can be declared a deserter. This dreadful name can be applied to him although, in effect, he is no different from the employee in any other type of industry who fails to report to work for two or three days and then simply returns to his work. There is no suggestion that a person who absents himself from work in another industry for two or three days should be charged with desertion or fined up to Â£40. The man who stays away from work in other industries for two or three days or more, suffers only the loss of his wages; he is taken back into employment. </para>

                <para>The penalties proposed by the bill may be imposed even in circumstances in which the working of the ship is not affected. They may be imposed even at a time when a ship is in port and a seaman is absent without leave for over 48 hours. Even in that case, he suffers forfeiture of accrued wages up to an amount not exceeding Â£40, or he can be fined Â£40. I submit that these penalties should be reviewed and put in their proper perspective. I do not think that the worker who absents himself from employment on a ship under those conditions should be penalized as he is. In addition to losing his pay, he may be fined. That is unjust. As it would seem that the Government proposes to persist with the provision of penalties, I suggest that at least the amounts should be reviewed and put on a more reasonable scale. </para>

                    <para>.- What worries me about these clauses is that they are so completely and utterly lopsided as far as penalties for breaches of various regulations are concerned. They refer, indirectly or directly, to the penalties that can be imposed on a seaman. Clause 62 makes references to the penalties for desertion: failure or refusal without reasonable cause to join his ship or to proceed to sea in his ship; absence from his ship without leave; insubordination or wilful disobedience to a lawful command; continued wilful disobedience to lawful commands; assaulting the master or another officer of his ship; conspiring with another seaman or apprentice to disobey lawful commands at sea; wilfully damaging his ship or stealing or wilfully damaging the equipment of his ship; stealing or wilfully damaging the cargo of his ship or the ship's stores; or secreting a stowaway on  hi9  ship. All these misdemeanours refer to seamen; officers are not mentioned in clause 62 or in any other of these clauses, although there is a mention of the master in clause 70, which proposes the insertion of a new section 115, subsection (12.) of which states - </para>

                <para class="block">The interesting point about that provision is that the master is to be fined if he does not punish a seaman. That is the only way in which the master is penalized. He has to carry out the provisions of the legislation or he is " for it ". </para>
                <para>This is- completely one-sided. Why is there not a set of clauses in the bill covering misdemeanours by officers of a ship, such as provocation? There is not one provision in this bill under which a master or an officer can be disciplined for committing acts that are not in accordance with the ethics and traditions of the sea and with moral principles. I am surprised that this measure is so one-sided and so loaded against the seamen. An agreement is signed when a seaman is taken on by a master. This is only a one-way agreement. I have always thought that when an agreement is signed, both parties are equally committed. In this case, it is a completely lopsided affair in which the poor old seamen are " up for it " in many ways and are liable to very heavy penalties, but the officers and masters of ships go scot free. How often is trouble on a ship due, not entirely to indiscipline by seamen, but to the arrogant, bullying character of the master? </para>

                    <para>. -  I think that the view of the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline> is a very distorted one. These clauses deal with a series of fines and bring the amounts up to date, in accordance with modern values. The principal act contains many provisions which make masters and officers of ships liable to penalties. In some cases, it makes certain offences indictable offences. There is no need to amend a provision that a master or an officer who does certain things shall be guilty of an indictable offence. That does not need amendment to bring it up to date. Some provisions of the act dealing with penalties to be imposed on other than seamen have been amended. They have already been referred to. The penalties for taking a ship to sea with the load-line submerged have been multiplied, not by two, but in some cases by ten. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Air admitted, in answer to the honorable member for Wilmot, that he was not in a position to give him information that he required on a number of matters. That is, in itself, a serious matter, particularly when we are dealing with the question of penalties. There are a number of very heavy penalties for various misdemeanours by seamen. A penalty of Â£40 is mentioned in one case. The list includes a number of offences for which penalties of fines or terms of imprisonment can be imposed on seamen. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister mentioned that, for assault, a captain could be fined Â£20 or sentenced to three months gaol. If a captain were to assault a seaman, I think that he should get twelve months or eighteen months gaol. That would be a light penalty in such a case. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the penaltites are heavy enough or too heavy. </para>
                <para>There is another aspect of this matter that should not be forgotten. These penalties would be serious at any time, but they are very serious when the legislation is being administered by a Liberal Government, supported by the Australian Country party. We know the antagonism of Government supporters to trade unionists and the trade union movement generally. These penalties can be imposed by people appointed by this Government. That is a very serious position. No wonder the unions are worried about it. </para>
                <para>This matter resolves itself into one of the administration of the legislation by the Government. The penalties are very severe and the legislation could be administered harshly under a government that is unsympathetic towards trade unionism. That is undoubtedly the case with the present Government. Therefore, we should examine these clauses carefully. If the act were being administered by the Labour party, it would be tolerantly administered. There would be proper supervision and sympathetic consideration }f all cases. But the Minister has glossed over these penalties and has said that he is not in a position to say why this or that has been done. Behind it all, there is a government which is unsympathetic towards the trade union movement. That indicates the danger to those people who go down to the sea in ships in regard to the penalties that could be imposed under these provisions. </para>
                <para>I agree with the argument that has been put forward. I feel that the Government should take note of what has been said on this side of the chamber in respect of the penalties. Throughout the trade union movement there is, naturally, a desire to remove from legislation, provisions for penalties which could react against workers generally. I am seriously worried by the fact that, under an arrogant master of a ship, for instance, intolerance could be shown and injustice meted out to seamen. In addition to that, at the top level, there is a government which is opposed to trade unionism. A government which is the enemy of the trade union movement in this country is introducing legislation under which, undoubtedly, it could impose penalties - legislation which, if administered harshly, would result in injustice to trade unionists who are obliged to take ships to sea. I sincerely trust that some effort will be made by the Government to review these matters, and that safeguards will be provided for the people who come within the scope of the legislation. </para>

                <para class="block">There is no doubt that the clause now under consideration is most important. We discussed previously the section giving to the master of a ship power to impose the penalties which are set down and which have just been criticized by members on this side of the chamber. </para>
                <para>It is true that the master charges and fines the seamen, but in addition, he is asked to record in the official log book the fact that a member of the crew has been found guilty and fined. That is regarded as a bad report. A seaman who receives a satisfactory discharge at the end of a voyage expects the discharge to be his certificate of service. But that is not so. If three bad reports are recorded against a seaman, he may be put out of the industry for six months. That penalty is rather severe. Three bad reports could arise out of the fining of a seaman by the master of a vessel and the seaman could be discharged as a result of those reports. If he is discharged at a port other than his home port, he has no right of repatriation and has to find his own way back to his home port. Could any more drastic penalty be imposed upon a member of the Australian mercantile marine? </para>
                <para>We regard the Government's proposal as objectionable and we propose a further amendment to the effect that a seaman shall be advised of any bad report recorded against him. It is important that he should know of any such report. Proposed new section 115(3.) reads - </para>

                <para class="block">Why does the Government not restrict paragraph (b) to providing for notification of the seaman within twenty-four hours? What is to prevent the master informing the seaman of a bad report within that time if the seaman is aboard the ship or within easy communication of the master? Yet the Government adds the words "or as soon thereafter as is practicable "! The master may consider that the seaman should not be advised for some time, and he may leave the ship, quite unaware that a bad report had been made against him. The master might then seek to communicate with the seaman. If three bad reports have been made against a seaman, any facts disclosed by his discharge at the end of the voyage are of no importance; he is out of the industry for six months. That is a terrific penalty. </para>
                <para>To-night we heard honorable members opposite asking that people be allowed to follow their usual occupation. Surely, after a seaman has been fined, he has paid the penalty for whatever offence he committed. But he also gets a bad report, and if he gets three bad reports he is out of work for a period of six months. </para>
                <para>Most remarkable is the agreement into which the seaman is asked to enter. The maritime organizations make some very serious comments in relation to this provision. The seaman, when he enters into the agreement, may not be aware of its exact terms. The Minister has already indicated that the seamen do not enter into individual agreements, but into a collective agreement with the master. The seamen merely attach their signature. How can it be reasoned that any seaman, signing on in that way, will read in detail the contents of the agreement? </para>
                <para>I shall read to the House the unions' comments about the agreement - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Until the amendments of 1952, except by a regulation of the maritime industry commission, penalties were not contained in an agreement without the consent of the seaman, in fact, seamen generally did not realize the penalties were only by agreement, and the unions know of no case where seamen rejected the agreement because of such inclusion. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">So, while the unions expressed the viewpoint that the seaman would be within his right in objecting to the inclusion of penalties in the agreement, it is quite evident that the great majority of the seamen are not aware of this fact. The unions further state - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is contrary to common industrial justice that a worker must sign an agreement to enter into employment and simultaneously agree to heavy penalties for any possible future offencewith which he may be charged, in a system where the master charges the seaman with the offence, tries the seaman and convicts the seaman. Evidently there must be some doubt asto the rights of the master to impose these penalties unless in advance the seaman has entered into this agreement.  lt is most remarkable that such a provision is included in any agreement - that a person must agree in advance that themaster who is to employ him shall have these rights. The unions also direct attention to the matter which I raised previously in relation to desertion. They comment in these terms - </para>
                    <para>A seaman may be absent at the time fixed for a vessel's departure - this does not mean the timeat which the vessel does depart- </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Honorable members no doubt are awarethat ships quite frequently for various reasons do not depart at the fixed time of departure. If the absence of the seaman has no bearing upon the late departure of the vessel, why should these savage penalties be imposed upon an unfortunate employee who is absent at the fixed departuretime of the ship, probably for some reasonthat is in his view quite substantial,, although it is not accepted as satisfactory by the master. </para>
                <para class="block">The comments of the unions continue -  - this does not mean at the time at which the vessel does depart - due to circumstances beyond his control, </para>
                <para class="block">That means that the seaman has not reported to the ship due to circumstances beyond his control. The seaman concerned may be fined and instantly dismissed, thus forfeiting any right of repatriation to the port at which he joined the ship. He is then automatically regarded as having a bad report, three of which, as I have already said, exclude him from employment in the industry. </para>
                <para>The penalties are savage and should be reviewed. Probably the Government will say that nobody has complained about them. My information is that the unions have continually complained about them and they now demand some improvement. I am amazed that the employees in this industry have been so patient and are still prepared to await the decision of the Government as to whether a change will be made in the conditions of their employment. I should not care to offer for employment under the same conditions as a seaman offers for employment, and I dare say that if every honorable member in this chamber were to answer frankly, he would agree that he would not like to sign on under those conditions. </para>
                <para>Having regard to the arguments that we have advanced, it is not unreasonable to say that the master must advise the seamen, especially if he is still aboard the ship or may be readily communicated with by the master, within 24 hours that a bad report has been recorded against him in the official log book of the ship. Honorable members must appreciate the serious consequences that can flow from the recording of three bad reports and the effect of those reports on the seaman's continued employment in the industry. While we find the general provisions objectionable, I think the Government should agree to improve the measure to the extent we suggest. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Surely if the master has conducted a proper inquiry into a breach of discipline, 24 hours is ample time for him to furnish a copy of the entry in the log book to the seaman concerned. I do not think there is any need for the master of the ship to have to provide this information to the seaman within 24 hours or " as soon thereafter as is practicable ". If the master has held the inquiry he can inform the seaman there and then that he has been fined, or after due consideration that he has been fined, and within 24 hours he could give the seaman a copy of the entry. If the words " or as soon thereafter as is practicable " remain in the bill, on occasions masters will deliberately allow a man to go away from the ship to some place where he cannot be readily contacted, so that the master cannot give him a copy of the entry. Or perhaps the master will let the seaman go away from the ship and not notify him for reasons best known to himself. In my opinion the master has plenty of time under the existing act  -  24 hours after holding the inquiry- - to notify the seaman of the fine that has been imposed. The Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment that has been moved by the honorable member for East Sydney. </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall not attempt to cover the whole range of section 115 of the act as the honorable member for East Sydney has done. This section of the act gives a master very limited authority to impose fines on members of the crew for breaches of discipline. I shall restrict my remarks to the terms of the Opposition's amendment. The clause provides that having fined a man, the master must enter the fact of the fine in the log. He then must notify the seaman of the log entry. The provision, as drafted, requires the master to notify the seaman of the log entry within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as is practicable. Whether the seaman is aboard ship or not, there is good reason for the provision. If the honorable member for East Sydney had a Tittle more knowledge and understanding of life and work at sea he would probably realize that on occasions in bad weather or in dangerous waters the master cannot leave the bridge for much longer than 24 hours at a time. He must first of all hold the inquiry. Having held the inquiry, he inflicts a fine. He makes an entry in the log. By the time it is written up the master may not be able to leave the bridge. That could be the case if the ship is at sea. On the other hand, and this is perhaps more pertinent, suppose the ship is in harbour. The inquiry is held; the log is written up; the master sends for the man to notify him of the log entry, and he discovers that the man has gone ashore. If the Opposition's amendment were carried the offending seaman would only need to keep out of the master's way for 24 hours and the fine would become illegal. That is the reason for the inclusion of the words " as soon thereafter as is practicable ". Otherwise the provision would be ridiculous. Suggestions have been made by honorable members opposite that the master could deliberately fail to notify the seaman of the entry in the log. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the Opposition regards it as compensation. If a seaman becomes ill or suffers from an accident in the course of his employment, the point at which he becomes entitled to surgical, medical and hospital expenses is of the greatest importance to him Although the Minister does not admit that payments of this kind can be regarded as compensation, the fact is that if, in such circumstances, a seaman is at his own or proper return port, he is entitled only to his wages, and then only for a prescribed period. He is not entitled to medical, surgical or hospital expenses. Under the existing act, when the seaman is returned to his own port his wages continue for one month. The Government proposes to extend the period to three months. This is a worth-while improvement. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>If a seaman falls ill or is injured in the course of his employment, why should there be any differentiation according to whether he is at his home port or away from his home port? The principle is the same in either case. If, having been injured or fallen ill in the course of his employment, he is entitled to these services while away from his home port, he should likewise be entitled to them after his return there or if he was injured or fell ill at his home port. </para>
                <para>The present practice is that the medical advisers must report that the seaman has recovered from the injury or illness before return to his home port. But, under these new provisions, he will be returned to his home port as soon as he is deemed fit to travel. What a great advantage that is for the shipowner! One can readily understand that some of these shipowners might consider that a man was fit to travel although he was in fact very ill - and probably, in the opinion of any reasonable person, unfit to travel - and they would hurry him back to his home port so that they can lessen their financial responsibility for maintaining him and for medical treatment or hospital accommodation. </para>
                <para>As I have said, I think that the Government has made some improvement by providing that the seaman is to be kept on wages for three months after return to his home port. Under the existing provision, he is to be kept on full wages for only one month. The union is very serious about this matter. It considers that, for the proper protection of the seamen, the act should not require that medical expenses shall be met only while the seaman who has fallen ill or been injured is not .at his proper return port. It considers that these expenses should be met wherever the seaman is if the injury or illness was suffered in the course of his employment. </para>
                <para>The Opposition regards the amendment as a most important one, and it intends to divide the committee upon it. </para>

                        <para>- They affect his wages. The general scheme of the act is that if a seaman, while away from his home port, becomes ill or is injured - apart from the kind of injury that leads to workers' compensation, which is a separate issue - he is entitled to the payment of medical expenses, and to his wages until he is brought back to his proper return port. </para>

                <para>Let us deal, first, with medical attention. If the amendment were carried, it would provide that a seaman who became ill or was injured when his ship was away from his home port, and whose ship had returned subsequently to his home port, should receive medical attention at the expense of his employer until he had recovered. That would give him a right that no other member of the community enjoys. The honorable member for East Sydney, this evening, has frequently related the conditions of seamen to those of workers in other industries ashore. No worker in any other industry ashore is entitled to medical treatment at the expense of his employer if he becomes ill at home at night with some sickness having no connexion with his employment. Why should such a right be conferred on seamen? I wonder whether Opposition members realize that that would be the effect of the amendment. We agree that it is fair enough that, when a seaman is in a ship away from his home port, he should be looked after at the expense of his employer - and the existing law so provides. But what reason is there to give him, after he has been brought home again, a right that no other worker in Australia enjoys? </para>

                    <para>. - There is some difference between the position of seamen and that of employees in industry generally, but I do not think that, on the ground of justice, any great objection could be taken to extending to other industries the provision that we now seek to have made in the maritime industry. However, we happen to be dealing with seamen at the moment. If a seaman is serving on a ship, and contracts an illness, it is most likely that it will be contracted aboard ship, and not in his home. The ship is his home while he is away from his home port, and his illness may be due to the ship being in a filthy condition. We have heard of the recent case of " Pattiwilya ", in respect of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster made a finding at variance with an order made by the Commonwealth Industrial Court. Judge Foster would not allow that ship to be sent to -sea in a filthy condition. He ordered it to be cleaned up, and that was the proper thing to do. But had he taken a different view, and had the ship gone to sea in a filthy condition, Australian seamen would have been required to serve on board under filthy conditions. Does the Minister consider that if, as a result, a seaman had contracted an illness, the shipowner should be able to wash his hands completely of responsibility for the man's medical expenses and for the continuance of his wages the moment the seaman was returned to his home port, even if he were still ill and required medical treatment? </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I cannot see why a man's wage should be reduced merely because he has the misfortune to suffer illness or injury in the course of his employment. What is wrong with the principle of making the employer responsible in these respects? How else can the seaman and his family be maintained? Seamen do not receive such high wages that they can put aside large sums for the maintenance of themselves and their families during periods of illness or incapacity due to injury, and a short period of idleness without wages can mean a great deal of suffering for a seaman and those dependent upon him. Why should his family be penalized merely because he has been injured or has fallen ill in the service of a shipowner? </para>
                <para>The Minister's attitude is most unreasonable. It is not sufficient to say that the principle that the Opposition seeks to have written into the act does not apply in other industries. I daresay that the granting of this benefit while seamen are away from their proper return port was not readily conceded to the maritime unions in the first place. I imagine they had to fight for it. If they are entitled to it while away from their home port, they are equally entitled to it when they return. 1 agree with the Minister's statement that the circumstance in question does not involve ordinary claims for workers' compensation. If seamen suffer injury, they have their civil rights under the compensation law. But surely we are only splitting straws when we query whether the payment is wages or compensation, because from the worker's viewpoint the main thing is the quantum of the income he receives and whether he is receiving sufficient to maintain his family. It does not matter much whether the income is called compensation or wages. If a man is not working, I suppose it is more appropriate to speak of his income as being compensation, because the term " wages " is usually used to describe money that one receives in return for services. If one is not working but he continues to receive the same income, in my opinion the appropriate term to use is " compensation ", and that is the sense in which I used the term in the first instance. </para>

                        <para>-  I say it. It is most laborious work. It is not the kind of employment that honorable members opposite believe it to be. In individual cases men may have to hang on much longer than normally would be the case, but there would not be a great number of men in the category to which the Minister referred. Because seamen have to be certified as fit for the employment in which they engage, it is most unlikely that there would be a case such as the one mentioned by the Minister. He put forward that hypothetical case in the hope that he would be able to destroy the Opposition's argument, but I do not think he has been successful. 1 repeat that the provision under consideration concerns mainly men who contract contagious diseases, sometimes as a result of filthy conditions aboard ship, and men who suffer injury. </para>

I should like to be perfectly fair and add that the amendments contained in the bill in regard to illness and associated expense provide for a vast improvement of the existing state of affairs. That fact has been admitted by the honorable member for East Sydney. I think we should pay due tribute to all those who have been responsible for effecting the improvement.

                <para class="block">These proposed sub-sections would substantially alter the present practice, and the union regards this alteration as being most serious. According to the arguments advanced to me by representatives of the union, these provisions conflict with the method of engagement provided in the award, which I submitted to the Minister when dealing with an earlier clause Because of that conflict, the union wants the provisions deleted from the bill. In addition, the provisions conflict with the present act, which forbids a seaman being returned to his home port until he is certified as having recovered. The union fears that, where a seaman is declared fit to travel - which is entirely different from being certified as fully recovered - he may be directed to or offered other employment before he is actually returned to his home port. The union feels that this is a weakening of the provision in the award. </para>

The union considers that the liability should commence from the first day of illness. I think that is a reasonable request. I can never understand why in this type of legislation, or in award conditions, a waiting period before liability commences is stipulated. Where an illness is contracted in the course of employment, as would be the case with a seaman, why does not the liability commence from the first moment of illness? Why should it not begin before seven days have passed? It appears to be an unreasonable provision which the Government is now proposing to enforce on the employees of the Australian mercantile marine. The Opposition regards the amendment as important and will call for a division if the Government does not accept it. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson)</inline> asks us to be grateful for the crumb from the employer's table. Not one act of any State, whether it be a workers' compensation act or a government employees' compensation act, has a provision such as this. The New South Wales Government Railways Act, covering railway men, deals with this very subject in section 100b. The New South Wales Workers Compensation Act provides for the whole, period of disability of a worker to be paid for. Every other workers' compensation act in Australia has a similar provision. None of them contains a provision for a waiting period of seven days before the commencement of liability of the employer. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member for Fawkner said that the period before commencement of eligibility has been fourteen days and that we ought to be glad to have it reduced to seven. Instead of holding such a view, the least the honorable member and the Government he supports should do is to take some notice of what other governments, and the courts throughout Australia, have done in relation to this very subject. The Government proposes to act in a manner which is contrary to the approach adopted by State governments. Surely the Minister for Air does not seriously claim that a sick seaman is entitled to less consideration than is a sick railwayman. Does he claim that the wife and family of a seaman are not entitled to the same protection as the wives and families of rail- </para>

                    <para>Way workers in the various States enjoy? I defy the Minister to produce here a copy of any workers' compensation act, or any other such act of any State legislature which provides for a waiting period of seven days before eligibility for payment for sickness hurt or injury commences. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Obviously the Government examined the provision we are now discussing, since it made a decision to reduce the waiting period from fourteen to seven days. The least that it should have done was to go as far as the workers' compensation acts of the State legislatures go in this matter. </para>
                <para>The adoption of the amendment moved by the honorable member for East Sydney would merely bring this provision into line with the similar provision in the New South Wales Government Railways Act. Section 100b of that act provides for sickness payments to commence from the beginning of the sickness, and that is what we propose here. It is a common principle, which is present in every act of this nature passed by the New South Wales Parliament for many years. The provision for a waiting period' of seven days, which was in the New South Wales Government Railway Act, was repealed not less than fifteen years ago. So this Government is fifteen years behind the times in relation to the benefits that should be payable to workers who fall by the wayside in the course of their employment. </para>
                <para>Surely the very fact that the provision has been looked at, and the waiting period reduced from fourteen to seven days, means that the Government could well look at it again and make the provision accord with similar provisions in State legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument advanced by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> is based on a comparison of provisions relating to railway workers in New South Wales and the provision in this proposed sub-section relating to seamen. The honorable member entirely overlooks the fact that a seaman who becomes ill away from his home port is entitled to wages till he returns to that port, or for a week after bc has recovered, or for three months after he gets back if he has not recovered. That does, not apply to railway men. He is also entitled to medical expenses. The honorable gentleman also overlooks the enormous cost of maintaining a sick seaman away from his home port, moving him home as a passenger, and paying his medical expenses. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That brings me to another point. The honorable member for Blaxland talked about a crumb from the employer's table when referring to the fact that after considerable negotiation beween the parties the Government had reduced the waiting period before a seaman qualified for sick pay from fourteen to- seven days. Those words of the honorable member moved me to) remind the committee, that ultimately the expenses involved in these cases are borne not by the shipowners, but by the people, of Australia, in the added costs, of coastal transport. SO, there is a very important national interest involved in seeing that the expenses of. maintaining our coastal shipping are kept in reasonable bounds. It is not merely a matter of crumbs from the employer's table. </para>
                <para>M*. E, JAMES, HARRISON, (Blaxland) fcl?. 17 a.m.],.. - As j, expected^ the. Minister has. not examined the acts of other legislatures on such matters, and I do not- know how many of his. colleagues, are in the same position. The Minister, talks about the C.onsiderable expense, involved in looking after, returning to his home port, and providing medical expenses for, a seaman who is. sick, or injured.. Will the Minister say that a. seaman whose home port is Sydney and who is hurt in Brisbane is a different case from a railwayman from Sydney who is hurt during the course of his employment at Taree? There is no difference between the two cases. The hospital expenses of the railwayman injured at Taree are met by the railway service. He will be brought home and receive sick pay- from the time of the commencement of his. disability. And in New South Wales the period of that payment is not. limited to three months.. Under section 100b of the Government Railways A,ct it is unlimited. The payment could continue for twelve months if the disability lasted that long,, and.- the man would be paid for every day pf the period. His medical, expenses would also he met. </para>
                <para>The Minister- talked, about loading the coastal shipping industry with costs. Compare, with that possibility the hardship imposed on the family of an injured worker! Talk about crumbs from the employer's table! To Opposition members, the family of a man injured at work is much more important to the community than are the profits of the people who run. ships around our coasts. </para>

                <para class="block">The honorable member mentioned section 100b of the New South Wales Government Railways. Act. Section 108 of the New South Wales Transport Act makes exactly the same provision. I cannot see that there is any sense in having a waiting period of seven days before an injured or ill seaman becomes eligible for sick pay, because it is quite simplest has been done on numerous occasions;- =for people to get a certificate from a medical practitioner to cover them for seven days. There are doctors who will gives such certificates whether the patient is sick or not. If an applicant for sick pay cares, to overcome a legal provision by subterfuge he can readily do so. No purpose is served by stipulating this period in the bill. The position could quite easily be overcome by a seaman, but to overcome it. he possibly may have to be a little careless with the truth, and he may perhaps need to ask a medical practitioner also to be careless with the truth. There is no reason at all why a man who is sick should npt immediately become entitled to sick pay. If the Government wishes to provide a safeguard, why does it not provide that unless a seaman, has been in the industry for a, certain period of time he shall not be entitled to sick pay if the duration of his sickness, does not exceed seven days? </para>

Under the proposal of the Government, a seaman who is sick or injured, in order to be entitled to wages, must require medical treatment for more than seven days. That is most unfair and is in conflict with practically every other worthwhile piece of legislation covering injury or illness under the various awards. I cannot see why the Government should propose to stipulate the period of seven days. Undoubtedly, this is just another attempt by the Government to bolster the position of the shipowners and to give them further benefits at the expense of the people who will come within the scope of the act. </para>

                        <para>- It is of no use the Minister asking what we did. A LiberalAustralian Country party Government is in office at the moment. Why does it not do the job properly? The fact that we might have overlooked just one item during our term of office is no excuse for failure to eliminate this period of seven days now. </para>

                <para>I say to the Minister for Air and the Minister for Labour and National Service that no clear reason has been given for the imposition of the seven-day stipulation. The Minister for Air said that it was not possible to compare seamen with railway workers, or with other workers in industry. The honorable member for Blaxland, who is a man of wide industrial experience, showed quite clearly that that could be done and that there was no difference between the position of a man injured on board a ship and a railway worker injured at a country town away from his home town. To stipulate a period of seven days is grossly unjust, and undoubtedly the union is justified in objecting to it. </para>
                <para>I should like to know why it is that the Minister for Air is virtually the only member on the Government side who is answering the points raised by the Opposition. If there are sound and sane answers to the matters that we raise, why are not some of the other members of the Government in a position to speak? The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howson)</inline> stated that the old provision prescribed a period of fourteen days, and that it is now proposed to reduce the period to seven days. What a tremendous advance it is in this atomic age to give seven days away! Would it not be better to eliminate the limitation altogether? Honorable members on this side of the chamber point out that tremendous hardship is involved in this matter. </para>
                <para>Why should a man who is sick or injured be subject to any limitation regarding the period of medical treatment? That is the question that the Minister must answer. Why is this act to be out of conformity with practically every other piece of industrial legislation in this respect? I do not know of any court in this country, no matter how biased it might be against the interests of the workers, which would adopt the proposal that is incorporated in this legislation. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to the statements that have been made by honorable members with wide industrial knowledge on this side of the chamber and decide to accept the Opposition amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a short and simple answer to what the honorable member for East Sydney has submitted. The bill requires a master to hand over to a proper authority at a port the account of wages and the effects of a seaman who has been left behind. If a master puts a seaman ashore, he will naturally leave the account and the effects at the port where he is, but it will occur sometimes that a seaman will miss his ship; it could even be that his absence is not discovered until after the ship has sailed. The account of wages and the effects must then be delivered up at some other port. This is usually the vessel's next port of call, although it will not always be so convenient to the seaman himself. It would be impracticable in all cases to comply with the section if amended as proposed, without unreasonably delaying ships. I think this explanation is obvious enough to honorable members, and for that reason the Government cannot accept the amendment. I might say that the next amendment raises the same point, and for the same reasons it cannot be accepted. </para>

                <para class="block">Although the proper procedure is to do these things by agreement, what is to prevent it? If a seaman or an apprentice is left ashore for some reason or other he will not be unreasonable. It is recognized that if it is impracticable to comply with some request, there should be a conference about the matter in order to reach agreement. I think that is the way this matter should be determined. As the clause is now worded, we have the same objection to it as we had to the earlier provision, namely, that " a port" can mean a port anywhere. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> said that it may be impracticable to pay the wages and to deliver the effects of the seaman or apprentice concerned at the port where he is left ashore, and that usually the wages and effects are then delivered at the vessel's next port of call. In my opinion, if there were no other way of adjusting this matter, there would be no difficulty in the master and apprentice or seaman concerned reaching an agreement. Therefore, I think that the request of the union is reasonable. I might mention that one of the reasons for this request by the unions is that the provision appearing in the clause conflicts with a provision of the 1955 award. Consequently, the unions object to it. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">This clause deals with the delivery of the effects of a deceased seaman, and it is designed to meet the convenience of the next of kin. In most cases, these men die without making a will, and the usual practice is for their effects to be held until the estate is settled, for delivery to the next of kin. The union contends that this is an unnecessary inconvenience in most cases to the next of kin, because the effects of a seaman on board a ship are usually of minor value and therefore they have only sentimental value to the person concerned, or the person who will eventually obtain delivery. It is the opinion of the unions that instead of holding up the delivery of these minor personal effects which, in some cases, have been held for a long period of time, it is not unreasonable to ask that these effects be delivered to the next of kin including for this purpose - because it is a provision contained in other parts of legislation where recognition is given to the status of a de facto wife - a dependant or next of kin who may be a de facto wife. </para>

                    <para>. - With all respect to the honorable member for East Sydney, I think the amendment is impracticable. Section 153 of the principal act does not deal with the disposal of a seaman's effects; it merely gives some one authority to handle them. Section 156 is the section dealing with disposal. Proposed new section 153 gives authority to some one to take possession of the seaman's effects before they are handed over to a person authorized by law to receive them. Section 156 empowers the Minister to deal with the effects. If they are of considerable value, they must be handed to the person who is the legal representative of the deceased seaman, usually the administrator or executor of his estate. If the effects are of small value as in the case mentioned by the honorable member for East Sydney specifically, where it is unreasonable to put somebody to the expense of proving the estate and setting up an administrator or executor, section 156 empowers the Minister to dispose of them. </para>

                    <para>. -Clauses 149, 150, 151 and 152 are designed to amend sections 286 to 289 of the principal act. These are among those historical sections of the Navigation Act under which the Australian Government purports to exclude from the interstate coastal trade ships which do not comply with certain conditions. Other ships can enter into that trade only if they hold a licence. I believe the opinion is widely held that since the decision of the High Court on road transport cases, these sections could not be sustained. I am not asserting that myself, of course. I cannot readily distinguish a system of discretionary licensing as between ships passing from one State to another, from a system of discretionary licensing in regard to road vehicles travelling from one State to another. If one has been held invalid, it would seem to follow that the other would be invalid. Since we are being asked to concur in the amendments to these sections, I should like to ask the honorable and learned Minister whether he can explain why those sections are being persevered with. In particular, can the Minister distinguish the discretionary licensing provisions in the Navigation Act from the discretionary licensing provisions in the various road transport cases which the High Court and the Privy Council have held to be invalid as infringing section 92 of the Constitution? </para>

                <para>The principal act provides that, in the case of certain offences, a ship in respect of which the offences were committed may be disqualified by the Governor-General from engaging in the coasting trade. The argument advanced by the Minister was that by the time an offence could be proved, the ownership of the vessel might have changed and the penalty would be imposed in other directions, and, therefore, it was unnecessary to make this provision. </para>
                <para>The act states that the matter shall rest solely on the decision of the Governor-General, but obviously that means the government, and we could not expect this Government to act against the shipowners by disqualifying the ship as well as penalizing the owners or those who owned it when the offence was committed. Therefore, the Opposition will not press this matter to a division although we raise strong objection to it. I believe that some such provision is necessary even if it has not been applied frequently, or at all. This provision should remain in the act so that the discretion will rest with the Minister, if he believes that the offence is so grave as to warrant sterner action than the imposition of a fine on an individual, to take action to disqualify the ship itself. </para>

                <para class="block">Under the bill the Minister may cancel or suspend a certificate of competency if the holder has been convicted of an offence in a Commonwealth country. The kind of offence is not specified. It could be of the most minor character. It might be only an industrial offence - which members of the Australian Labour party would not regard as an offence at all - but it could result in the loss of a certificate. The power given here is too great to place in the hands of a Minister. Under the principal act the words " indictable offence " are used. The power of the Minister to act where serious offences have been committed is quite sufficient. The proposed power is too vast to place in the hands of any individual. I believe that the word " indictable " should be retained. It puts beyond doubt the question whether a minor offence is referred to. Under the bill a conviction for drunkenness might result in the cancellation of a certificate of competency. Surely no one would suggest that any one who had been convicted of drunkenness on one occasion should be liable to such treatment at the hands of a Minister who wanted to exercise his full powers. I suggest that the existing wording is preferable and should be retained. </para>

                    <para>- The Opposition objects to the proposal to repeal section 421. The reason given by the Minister is that the section has never been availed of. That is not a good argument for the deletion of a sound provision. </para>

                <para>Section 421 reads - (1.) The owner of every ship registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting trade (not being a fishing boat) shall in each year make a return to the Minister at the prescribed time showing the aggregate gross earnings during the preceding year of all ships so registered or engaged in  the  coasting trade of which he is owner, in  the  prescribed form: </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Provided that the returns required to be furnished in regard to ships not registered in Australia shall relate only to the earnings of those ships whilst engaged in the coasting trade. (2.) The Minister shall not publish or disclose in any way any return made under this section, or any summary of such returns other than figures only showing the percentage variations from year to year in the aggregate gross earnings returned, distinguishing, if he shall think fit,  the  coasting trade: </para>
                    <para>Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent the Minister from using the returns  to  assist him in preparing periodical estimates of  the  extent to which the relation between imports and exports of Australia as a whole is affected by the freight earnings of shipping which reaches this country. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The section goes on to provide one or two other limitations upon the power. I am not suggesting that that provision is completely satisfactory, but it could be of great use to a government in getting the type of information which to-day is largely withheld from governments and unavailable to them. Why should the shipping companies not furnish this information, which is most important to a government in determining its attitude to the continual requests which are made for increased freight rates? Why should this information not be available and on record, as provided in this section? Why should it not be readily available to the Minister? As a matter of fact, I should imagine that this information would be essential to a government in determining whether any request for increased freight rates was justified or otherwise. </para>
                <para>Freight rates are most important to the economy of this country. I should have imagined that this was one power which the Country party would ask to have retained, so that the information could be obtained. There would be an obligation on the shipowners to supply it. It is of no use to depend on them to supply it voluntarily. Governments have had experience of investigations of shipping companies' activities based upon information supplied in that way. The companies will not reveal their profits or the earnings of their ships unless they are obliged by statute to do so. </para>
                <para>I think the section should be retained. It is not a sufficient answer to say merely that it has never !been used in the past. I should imagine that an incoming Labour government - which is not very far away, I hope - will make considerable use of this power. Therefore, the Opposition proposes to divide the committee once again, because we think this is an essential provision, which should be retained in the act. </para>

                    <para>.Despite the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom when the clause was inserted, I believe that he was Attorney-General in March, 1923, when the section was proclaimed to come into operation. That was very near to the time, of course, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, as he now is, came into the Parliament and succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom as Attorney-General. I am relying for this information on an answer which the Minister supplied to me within the last week in answer to a question regarding the information that had been derived under the section. The answer was that the section was proclaimed to come into operation on 1st March, 1923. It remains a dead letter, not because of the ineffectuality of the section, but .because further steps are necessary under the section. You will notice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> the section requires the owner of a ship to make a return to the Minister at the prescribed time and in the prescribed form. No regulations have ever been made prescribing the time or prescribing the form. </para>

I concede that the Curtin Government, in the heat of war, could have done it, and that the Chifley Government, in the four post-war years that it was in office, could have done it. But so also could the Bruce-Page Government have done it in the six years it was in office after the section was proclaimed. So could the stagnating Lyons Government have done it in the eight years it was in office, or the first Menzies Government, or the only Fadden Government, or the Menzies Governments since 1949. It is true that Labour could have done it. It is also true that anti-Labour could have done it in the four times as long period that it has been in office. </para>

                <para>This section has never been given a fair trial. For twelve years the section was not proclaimed. For 35 years the necessary regulations have not been made. The way to get relevant information on shipping costs is not to delete the section, but either to make regulations under the section, or to amend the section and then make regulations under it. </para>

                <para class="block">This clause deals with actions against officials. The present provision in the act provides that an action must be commenced within three months from the date of the act forming the subject of such action. Sub-section (3.) of section 384 provides that where the plantiff discontinues the action, or judgment is given for the defendant, costs are determined on the basis of treble costs. The new clause would provide that action should be taken within a period of two years and that the costs in any such action should be at the discretion of the court. We think this is an improvement on the present act, and I submit the matter to the committee for its consideration. </para>

Perhaps I should say the first portion of a petition, because the organization has just commenced to collect signatures to the petition, and it is believed that when it is finally ready for presentation it will carry at least  1,000,000  names of Australian citizens. They will not all be names of pensioners, but of Australian citizens generally. The petition is for an improvement in the financial position of pensioners. The petitioners request that the pension rate be increased so that it will be  50  per cent- of the basic wage. They particularly ask that the harsh restriction on the provision of life-saving drugs to pensioners be removed. As honorable members are aware, persons in receipt of an income of  Â£2  a week or more who are granted a pension are denied the benefit of the pensioner free medical scheme, even if they are receiving the maximum pension. I believe this to be a most serious matter. These old people, with their meagre incomes, should at least receive social service benefits on the same basis as other persons, and they should receive the benefits of free medical services. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Although the petition was quite respectfully worded, it was not in accordance with the forms of the House, and I was, therefore, denied the opportunity of presenting it in the normal way. I shall endeavour to have the pensioner organization correct this defect when the final petition is presented. I understand that the Australian people are signing this petition in their thousands. Whatever differences of opinion may exist among the people on other matters, there appears to be a great degree of unanimity on the proposition that some assistance should be given to these unfortunate persons. </para>
                <para>I turn now to another important matter, which concerns the Treasury. An organization known as the Poliomyelitis and Physically Handicapped Society has been purchasing motor cars for its members who suffer from this dread disease. For some considerable time these cars have been free of sales tax. Many of the sufferers would not have been able to have cars otherwise, because most of them are in such  a financial position that they have to borrow the money or make whatever other financial arrangements they can in order to purchase these cars. It is only the fact that the cars have been free of sales tax that has enabled many of these persons to purchase them. </para>
                <para>To many of these unfortunate people motor cars are not a luxury; they are essential as a normal means of transport. About 80 members of this society have obtained cars free of sales tax through the organization. Evidently the motor car distributors and the society were assured by some one that the cars would be available free of sales tax. However, after a considerable period of time, the Treasury has been in touch with the Poliomyelitis and Physically Handicapped Society and has intimated that sales tax should have been paid on this" cars. The department has now submitted an account to the society. The society obviously is not very flush with funds. It cannot pay the sales tax, and it has had to pass the account on to the individual purchasers, advising them of their liability and informing them that the amount must be paid within a specified time. </para>
                <para>If there is any section of the community that should be freed of the liability to pay sales tax on motor cars, it is this section. In any case, the motor cars involved were purchased in the belief that they were free of sales tax. According to the society, officers of the department gave an assurance that they were free of sales tax and evidently the motor car distributors were of the same opinion. If, therefore, an error has been made and the Treasury is entitled to collect sales tax on these vehicles, I suggest that it should be prepared to let the matter drop and write off the debt, if it can be regarded as a debt. Many of these unfortunate persons cannot pay the sales tax, and they will lose their equity in the vehicles. </para>
                <para>This is a most serious and important matter, and I hope that very soon after the adjournment of the Parliament the Treasurer will give attention to this matter and have it satisfactorily adjusted. </para>
                <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
                <para>House adjourned at 1.28 a.m. (Friday) to a date and hour to be fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

                            <para>The encouragement has taken two forms. One, the Central Bank has indicated to the trading banks that it would be appropriate for total bank advances to be increased above the 1957 level, and is administering special accounts so as to leave the banks with sufficient liquidity to enable them to do this. Two, the Central Bank has asked the trading banks, in connexion with the increasing of bank advances above the 1957 level, to give attention to such important objects as housing and the needs of the rural industries. For a fuller explanation of the measures used by the Central Bank to regulate the volume of bank lending and to influence the general direction of that lending, I invite the honorable member's attention to the statement I made to the House on 12th March last. </para>

                        <para>The statutory provisions relating to the protection of the depositors of banks are contained in Part II., Division 2, of the Banking Act 1945-1953. The provisions apply equally to both private trading banks and private savings banks. While they do not provide that the repayment of deposits with the several banks is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government, the provisions are designed to ensure that depositors are fully protected. It is also relevant to mention that, under the terms of their authorities to carry on banking business, the private savings banks are permitted to invest depositors' funds only in Commonwealth and State government securities (including securities issued or guaranteed by semi-governmental authorities), loans to guaranteed building societies, loans for housing or other purposes on the security of land, and deposits with the Commonwealth Bank and other banks. In addition, the authorities contain other provisions requiring the private savings banks to maintain certain minimum levels of liquid assets. </para>

                            <para> At one time, Commonwealth securities were accepted at face value in payment of federal estate duty but, in October, 1934, the Australian Loan Council, which determines the terms of conditions of Commonwealth loans, decided to withdraw the concession. Although it has been requested on several occasions since then to reconsider its decision, the Loan Council has adhered to the determination made in 1934. The proceeds of income tax and estate duty are required for government works and services. The Government could not make these payments by means of Commonwealth securities and, if such securities were accepted in payment of taxes, the funds forgone would have to be obtained from other sources such as extra taxation or treasury bills finance. </para>

It should be noted that while both the United States and the United Kingdom governments make available awards for which Australian university students are eligible, these awards do not appear to come within the scope of this question. The only United States government awards applicable to university students are those under the Fulbright scheme and these are not scholarships in the strict sense but cover travel grants only. Two United Kingdom government awards - for Oriental, Slavonic, East European and African studies and the fishery research training grants - may possibly come under the terms of the inquiry but these are offered to nationals from a number of countries and no details are known concerning any awards of these scholarships to Australians. </para>

                        <para>-  The information which the honorable member has asked me  to  supply is not readily accessible. A physical examination of every import licensing file created since March,  1952,  would be necessary before the details could be supplied, and, as the number of files involved would be approximately  750,000,  I feel sure the honorable member will appreciate that I could not ask my department to undertake such a task.

                            <para>It is a fact that in one case at least which has come to the notice of my department, a migrant resident in a Commonwealth hostel in New South Wales was informed by the Metropolitan Tenancy Applications Advisory Committee that his present housing circumstances were such as not to warrant his inclusion in the ballots for Housing Commission dwellings. </para>
                   </item>
                        <item label="3.">
                            <para>The situation is that in New South Wales, all migrants may register for participation in Housing Commission ballots after a period of twelve months' residence in that State. However, in the allocation of Housing Commission homes in New South Wales, 40 per cent. are reserved for applicants living in emergency housing settlements conducted by the Housing Commission,in which category Commonwealth hostels are apparently not included. I would like to assure the honorable member that we have always been concerned that migrant families should, as far as possible, be placed on equal footing with older Australian residents in regard to eligibility for Housing Commission homes. This aspect was stressed during the negotiations in 1956 between the Commonwealth and State authorities for the renewal of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Following these representations. New South Wales (in which State migrants had been at the greatest disadvantage) revised its policy and agreed to all migrants, whether British or non-British, having the right to register for Housing Commission dwellings after twelve months' residence. The present position in other States is that in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, migrants are immediately eligible to register. In Victoria, there is a six months' residental requirement for British migrants and a twelve months' residential requirement for nonBritish migrants in metropolitan areas, and no residential requirement in country areas. In Queensland, there is a residential period of six months. I would like to assure the honorable member also that we would be most unwilling to support any policy which implied a sense of permanency to residence in hostels and, whilst the eligibility for registration for Housing Commission homes is a matter on which the States have the right to decision, it is also a matter on which my department has been anxious to ensure that migrants receive treatment similar to that available to all Australians. In this respect, one reason for the inclusion in the 1956 Housing Agreement, at the representations of the Commonwealth, of special provisions for the making of loans to building societies is that these societies offer the means by which migrants through cooperation and self-help may obtain homes of their own. </para>
