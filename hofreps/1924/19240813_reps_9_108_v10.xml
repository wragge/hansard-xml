                        <para>- As already announced in the press, two agreements were signed on. the 7th August by representatives of the British Government and the Soviet Union. Of these two agreements, one is of the nature of a commercial treaty, providing in general for most-favoured nation treatment in practically all matters of commerce. The other is a general agreement, dealing with matters pending between the two Governments, or their respective nationals, in regard to the validity of pre-war treaties, debts, compensation for damage to persons, and/or property, and other matters. In regard to these matters, no settlement has been arrived at, but provision has been made for negotiations between the parties interested. It must be noted that the agreements are concluded, not in the name of  His  Majesty the King, but on behalf of Great Britain and northern Ireland. In the case of the commercial treaty, provision is made for the accession of any dominion which so desires. The general agreement is, as I have said, of a conditional character, providing for subsequent agreements. A pledge has been given by the British' Government to submit the two agreements to the judgment and amendment of the British Parliament. The dominion governments are not included in the scope of the agreements, and are therefore not committed. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister for Defence a question without notice. I may be permitted a little explanation before asking it. A little less than two weeks' ago. I handed a telegram to the Minister asking that the <inline font-style="italic">Geranium,</inline> now making a survey of the Great Barrier Reef, should survey a channel said to exist directly opposite Townsville, in order that vessels coming from the East might come to Townsville direct without having to go nearly as far north as Thursday Island in order to get inside the Reef. I subsequently handed to the Minister a letter from the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, confirming the telegram to which I have referred, and mentioning the fact that a launch owned by a man who knows the channel said to be opposite Townsville, who is willing to pilot the surveying ship, was available. Authority was asked for the survey of this channel, and I ask now whether the Minister has given any attention to the matter? </para>

                        <para>- I am much surprised to hear a member of the Federal Parliament say that this is a Commonwealth obligation. It is most distinctly a state obligation, and' one with which we should not be concerned. Answers have been received from the Governments of Victoria and South Australia. They have not seen their way to agree to our proposal that they should bear half the expense. The matter has been further considered by the Cabinet, and I hope to be able to make, either to-day or to-morrow, an announcement as to the action we now propose to take. </para>

In view of the slow progress that has been made, I ask whether the Government is now prepared to accept a suggestion that I made some days ago that a relief party should be sent from the Katherine through to Boorooloola. The route that would be traversed is used every three weeks by the mailman. </para>

                        <para>- On Wednesday last, the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning)</inline> asked that a report be obtained as to the alleged mortality of travelling stock in the Northern Territory, said to have been due to lack of water, aggravated by the non-installation at one well of machinery required, and ordered twelve months ago, and also the failure to have a fresh bore sunk in another locality. It is understood that the well mentioned is the one at Blood's Creek, in South Australia, for the maintenance of which the Commonwealth Government is not responsible. The second matter is believed to relate to the bore at Charlotte Waters, the position in regard to which is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>During the year 1922, a new pump was installed at the old bore at Charlotte Waters, and other repairs to the bore were effected; but it subsequently transpired that, notwithstanding these repairs, a satisfactory service was not being maintained. Serious doubt having arisen as to the possibility of placing the old bore in a proper state of repair, and the question having been raised as to whether it would not be better to abandon that bore and sink a new one, the Works and Railways Department, in March, 1023, arranged with the South Australian Public Works Department to send a bore inspector to Charlotte Waters to thoroughly test and examine the bore, and to report as to what action should be taken to ensure the provision of an adequate supply of fresh water. The inspector reported that the casing had corroded to such an extent that, in his opinion, it was impossible to effect satisfactory repairs, and he recommended that a new bore be sunk. Pursuant to this report, which reached the Minister for Home and Territories on the 16th July, 1923, the proposal to sink a new bore, at an estimated cost of £4,550, was duly approved, and special provision made on the 1923-24 Works Estimates to meet the expenditure involved. The Estimates having been adopted by Parliament, the Minister for Works and Railways, on the 19th September, 1923, authorized the work to be put in hand forthwith. Tenders were called for by the Works Director, Adelaide, and about 20th November, 1923, the tender of Messrs. Johnstone Bros., for sinking a bore to a depth of 1,000 feet, was accepted by the Works and Railways Department. The wet season had meanwhile set in, and it was not practicable for work to be commenced immediately. Considerable progress has now been made with the sinking of the new bore, and it is expected that the work will very shortly be completed. </para>

                    <para>. - This is an entirely new provision, which merits the close consideration of the committee. It is proposed that a board of advice shall be established in London, but no information whatever is given as to how it shall be constituted. The amendment inserted by the Senate will have a far-reaching effect. We are asked to appoint three officers to a board to control the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank. These persons will have large powers, and the committee is entitled to know for what reason they are to be appointed and what qualifications they must possess. It is also proposed that Australian credits in London shall be covered by a note issue here. The London Board will no doubt conduct that business, and have power to recommend the amount to be placed to the credit of banks or individuals in Australia. Trading banks and large firms here doing business with England will be able to obtain notes in Australia against security. We have not even been told what the security is to be.. If the amendment is of vital importance why was it not inserted by the Government when the bill was previously before the committee ? This is a money bill for which this committee is responsible. The London branch of the Commonwealth Bank is at present conducted by a manager and an assistant manager. Both these gentlemen prior to their appointment in London had a long experience in banking and financial transactions in Australia, and some reason should be given why the present arrangement in London should be superseded. Notes are to be issued to cover credits in London. The Treasurer should indicate how it is proposed to finance this year's wool clip, which promises to exceed in worth that of last year - it may be £45,000,000 or £50,000,000 if the present high prices are maintained. But the high cost of shearing, freight and other charges may absorb almost two-thirds of the worth of the clip. This is the most dangerous amendment inserted in the bill. Since the war began, I have endeavoured to impress upon the Government the need for conducting the whole of Australia's foreign loan business through the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank. Public utilities, public boards, State Governments, and the Federal Government would benefit if the Commonwealth Bank were used for raising their loans in London. The conversion of loans should certainly be arranged through its agency, and not through that of firms such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Nivison and Son. Years ago people used to abuse Rothschild's system of finance, but even its disabilities could not compare with those suffered under the system now adopted by this Government. </para>

                        <para>- If this board is appointed in London and notes issued here against our credits there, the business of the bank will be greatly increased. We are touching only the fringe of finance, and as Australia's production grows the greater will be our need for a satisfactory system of financing exports. I have read the speeches delivered upon this amendment in another place, and have not been very much enlightened. I do not know of any other British dominion which has adopted the practice proposed in the amendment, which appears to me to be a dangerous innovation. No argument has been advanced in support of it. Men who have been to London seem to think that the Commonwealth Bank does not get as much assistance from the Government as it should. That may be due to the influence of stockbrokers and other financiers. Those cute gentlemen entertain visiting Ministers at dinners and parties, adopting the boa constrictor method of slobbering over the victim before swallowing it. I do not think the Treasurer knows anything about the amendment. If he understands it, and believes in it, why was it not included in the original bill? I hope my protest against this proposal will incite other honorable members to pay some attention to these amendments. At any rate, I have done my duty by trying to mould the bill in the interests of the Australian people. The basis of the prosperity of any country is sound finance. To-day the whole world is suffering from a faulty system of finance, and I hope Australia will lead in the adoption of new and better methods. </para>

                        <para>- I am entirely opposed to the creation of a board of advice in London ; the Australian directorate should be capable of the general control and management of the bank: But as the Government appears to be determined to establish a London board of advice, I desire that it shall be so constituted that Australian interests will, at least, be recognized in such appointments. It would be very dangerous to appoint men unfamiliar with conditions in Australia to sit as members of a board in a city like London, where there are powerful financial interests to combat. Does the Government intend to restrict the selection of members of the board? Will it insist upon them being Australians, and having Australian interests? Will it make certain that they know something of Australian conditions? Perhaps it would be advisable, before I comment fur- - ther on these points, to give the Treasurer an opportunity to enlighten the committee. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment, and others that will follow it, call for some explanation. The bill, as it left the House of Representatives, provided for local boards in different cities, and fixed the salary of the members of those boards at £200 per annum. The Senate's amendments make provision for a board in London, and substitute the words "London board" for "local board." There is no reference to the salaries of members of the board who are to receive such amount "as is fixed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board of directors." The committee is asked to agree to the . appointment of a board before it knows the salaries to be paid. I want to know how much the members of the board will receive. For all I know, the amount may be £1,000 or £10,000 a year. The committee should not allow the bill to go through until it has been informed how much will be paid to the members of the board. If a board is appointed, the members of it should be Australians, who are thoroughly conversant with not only commercial and business interests, but also rural interests in this country. They should be appointed here, and sent to London, and after their three years' engagement has expired, they should not be allowed to lose touch with financial, economic, industrial, and rural conditions in Australia. The type of men needed for the job cannot be obtained unless we pay big salaries. The Government must, if we agree to the amendment, appoint retired, wealthy Australians resident in London, or mediocre men who are not Australians, and can be manipulated by rival financial interests. Members of this committee are aware of the financial sharks that flourish in London; they are not necessarily Britishers, but are often international Jew financiers. It would be folly to expect nien receiving £200 or £300 a year to fight the international thieving Shylocks of London. I cannot understand the Senate, or any honorable member, endorsing such a proposal. If the members of the board are Australians, conversant with Australian conditions, and possessing financial ability, the Government will have to pay them £5,000 . or £6,000 a year ea.ch, making a total of £18,000 to £20,000 for the three of them. Unless the Government is prepared to spend that amount, the board will be worse than useless. Men paid only £200 or £300 a year will be the helpless playthings of the international financial groups that have their centres in London. I am opposed to the appointment of the board in any case, and particularly before the committee knows what salaries are to be offered to its members. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with a good deal of disappointment to the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "West).</inline> I knew that he and I differed on some features of the bill, notably as to whether the board of directors should consist of men appointed from outside or inside the bank, but I thought that we were agreed on the main principles of the bill. I was disappointed to find, not only that the amendment meets with his disapproval, but that the whole substance of the bill - its warp and woof - is not acceptable to him. The suggestion has been made that no legislation has ever been improved after leaving the House in which it originated. But the two Houses of Parliament meet to shed their wisdom on the various legislative proposals brought forward, and occasionally those proposals are improved in the second House. The Government thinks the bill has been improved by the addition of the provision for the appointment of a London board. The honorable member has said that there is no precedent for the Senate's amendment, and that there are numerous banks in Australia that have not appointed London boards. Many of the principal banks in Australia have London boards. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, the bulk of whose shares are held in Australia, is essentially an Australian bank, but it has a London directorate consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> S, H. Guiness, chairman;  Hon.  H. S.  Littleton, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> W. G. Butler. Another Australian bank with a London board is the Australian Bank of Commerce. The National Bank of Australasia, although an Australian-owned bank, finds it ad,visable, in the transaction of its business, to have a London board. The Bank of New Zealand is a very similar institution to the Commonwealth Bank; it acts as a national bank for the Dominion of New Zealand, and is more or less a central bank for the New Zealand banking system. It has strengthened its position, and has taken steps to keep itself <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with conditions in London, by appointing a London board of directors. The capital of the Bank of New Zealand was subscribed, partly by the Government of New Zealand and partly by private individuals. The arrangement is believed to secure the national interest and the private interests of the shareholders, and to be of general financial assistance to the Dominion. That bank has a London board. We consider the precedent a good one. We were impressed very much by the speech made by the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> when he raised the question, and if the bank is to function as we hope it will, and as the honorable member for East Sydney desires, as a national bank doing a great deal of work outside of Australia, it must be of considerable advantage to have the assistance of men in intimate touch with the financial life of London. An honorable member asked who are the Government nominees, and I refer him to the wording of the proposed new section. It provides that- </para>

                <para>The board of directors has yet to be appointed, and until a recommendation is received from it we cannot say who will be the members of the London board. I suggest to honorable members that the London board will be constituted of Australians resident in London - men with Australian interests. It is unthinkable that those who will be charged with the control of the bank in the public interest would do otherwise than recommend the appointment of persons having a knowledge of Australian conditions as well  as of the conditions in England and in other countries. Honorable members can be quite satisfied that the board of directors of the bank will not deal with this matter in the manner suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. The emoluments to be paid to the members of the London board are dealt with in a subsequent amendment, to which I shall not now refer, as it is not germane to the issue now before the committee. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument of the Treasurer is a very excellent one, and almost convinces me. My only difficulty is to understand why the reason he has advanced for the Senate's amendment did not appeal to him before the bill was introduced. The bill was on the stocks for about two years, and yet during that time this valuable suggestion, and the excellent arguments in support of it, do not appear to have occurred to the Treasurer in any shape or form. However, the representatives of the local banks appear to have awakened to .the fact that it is necessary to have a London board for the Commonwealth Bank, and they impressed this view upon their agents in another place. The matter having been forced upon the Treasurer, the honorable gentleman accepts the argument in support of the position which he has been forced to take up. I find from the <inline font-style="italic">Bankers' Record</inline> that a number of the private Australian banks have each an office in London, and to their directorates certain guinea pigs are appointed, who receive £200 a year or more out of the revenues of the banks. The position gives a man some standing in London. A man goes from Australia to England, and does not know what to do with himself. He calls upon the directors of a bank in London, and says, "Can you find me something to .do?" They say, " Certainly ; we shall make you a director, and you can draw £500 a year from the revenue of the bank." The <inline font-style="italic">Bankers' Record</inline> gives a list of many gentlemen who are drawing these guinea-pig pensions. Pencil marks show that others have looked up the matter before me. The Treasurer might have argued in support of the proposal that quite a number of banks having hundreds of branches throughout Australia, have each an office in' London, and this furnishes them with an -opportunity to appoint gentlemen to sinecures. He might have argued with equal force on the other side that English banks, such as the Union, the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, and the Bank of Australasia, have between there 600 branches operating in Australia, but they do not go to the trouble of appointing Australians as guinea-pig directors of their institutions. Apparently no English gentleman is sent out here who is so poor that he must draw funds from the revenues of one of these banks as a local director. The Union Bank, which has 200 branches in Australia, has only one man in charge here. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Fairbairn is . the one man who in New South Wales acts for the whole of Australia. At one time there were three appointed, but the other two were evidently considered encumbrances. I do not think that the matter is worthy of very much more consideration. We know what the Government is going to do. We know what the private banks want. We know that their pressure has been applied, and that the Treasurer is now prepared to accept proposals and arguments to which he was previously opposed. He is now prepared to agree to the appointment of certain gentlemen to sinecures. They will be .merely pensioners on the bank, and no doubt so long as the Government lives it will keep them in their positions. We cannot at present prevent that. But the Government will not live for ever. There will be other Governments, and the bank will be an excellent institution upon which they can impose. their friends. It is proposed that the members of the London' board shall hold office for four years, and shall be eligible for re-appointment. I think that the Government might have proposed that some, of these members should drop out after two years' service, so that the party on this side might be given a chance. We are told that the duties and powers of the board shall be such as may be delegated to it from time to time by the board of directors, but no powers or duties will be assigned to it; all that the members will have to do will be to go along at the end of each month and draw their fees from the bank. Then they can strut around in London society in the West End, and the emoluments they will draw from the bank will help to maintain them. If the Government wished to exclude this party in the matter altogether, -they might have proposed the appointment of the members of the London board for ten  years or for life. Four years is rather a long time for us to have to wait before we can appoint any one to this London board, and I am afraid that the only thing left us will be to increase the number of members of the board. . </para>

This will throw upon some future Government the responsibility of increasing the number of members of the London board, otherwise it will not be able to follow the example of the present Government, and enable some of its friends to draw pensions from the bank. The proposal will be of no benefit to the country, but it will enable the Government to appoint a few pensioners upon this national institution. </para>

He is now prepared to accept an amendment from another place to take the control of the funds out of the hands of Parliament and out of the hands of the Government, and permit a board to fix these salaries. The honorable gentleman should give some explanation of the reason why he is prepared to accept this amendment. The Government must take all responsibility for it. All that we can do is to make our protest, and vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.-The safeguards provided in connexion with this clause are the same as those provided in connexion with the appointment of the governor and the deputy governor of the bank. The amount of pay is to be fixed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board of directors. This House has on several occasions expressed complete willingness to hand the control of the Commonwealth Bank over to a board of directors composed of men in whom we can have confidence. The amount of remuneration to be paid to the directors in London might very well be left to the board of management to fix, for it will more likely err on the side of economy than extravagance. It is quite possible that the board will decide to pay even less than the amount which the Government proposed should be paid to members of local boards. The members of the local boards, had they been appointed, would have had certain definite continuous duties to discharge, but the members of the London Board of Advice will be required principally to obtain for the Australian Board of Directors, at irregular periods, the best advice possible from financial experts in London. The interests of the country are well protected in the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not satisfied with the Treasurer's explanation. I do not think that we should be asked to rely upon the discretion of the directors in a matter like this, for we do not know who they will be. The Government saw fit to. fix the remuneration to be paid to the Australian local board members, and I can see no reason why it should not do so in this case. We are informed that Parliament will shortly go into recess. It is quite probable, therefore, that we shall have no opportunity to express our opinion upon the. appointments which the Government makes to the board. That makes it all the move necessary that the conditions of appointment shall be made as definite as possible. Our past experience of the Government has proved that it shows no hesitation in appointing to responsible public positions friends of the parties which it represents, and it will doubtless adopt the same policy when appointing the directorate of the bank. As the usefulness of the bank will, under its new constitution, depend entirely upon the directors, it is not reasonable to expect honorable members on this side of the committee to agree to the omission of what they regard as necessary provisions to protect the public interests. The Government has shown that it is quite prepared to appoint men to positions of responsibility irrespective of merit or, ability. I trust that the amendment will not be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- -I regret that the Government is taking up an unreasonable attitude by refusing to accept an amendment that must surely commend itself to this committee. Although the Government is prepared to appoint a board of appeal, yet the bank is to be safeguarded by having a majority on that board of two to one. It is highly probable, though not certain, that the two members of the Board of Appeal will come to a mutual agreement. But if the two persons elected to the Board of Appeal, one representing the bank and the other the officers of the bank, disagree respecting the appointment of the  chairman,  the amendment proposed by the Government will not overcome the difficulty. Yet when the Labour party makes a reasonable suggestion, that in the event of disagreement an independent  chairman  be appointed by the Governor-General in Council, it is not accepted. We cannot but come to the conclusion that the Government is setting up a board of appeal that will be prejudiced against the bank's employees. These certainly will not look to that tribunal with any feeling of security, or that their interests will be safeguarded. This proposed board will be one of appeal in name only. As constituted, the bank has too much representation and its officers too little, and unless the provision is altered will not give satisfaction. The acceptance of my amendment will in no way affect the standing of the Government, but will ensure a fair and equitable judgment on all matters in dispute. I hope the Treasurer will agree to free the Board of Appeal of any taint of partisanship, and make it a body which appellants may approach with confidence. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has a wrong impression of the manner in which the Commonwealth Bank will be controlled. Disputes will arise, not between the board and the employees, but between the executive officers and the employees. The board will be a paramount and supervisory body, and a court to which the employees may appeal from the decisions of the executive officers. The amendment proposes that the Government shall intervene in every dispute between the employees and the executive of the bank, and attempts to set up a principle that does not operate in connexion with the ordinary Public Service. A dissatisfied officer of the Public Service does not appeal to the Governor-General in Council, but to a board representative of the Service, the head of the department concerned, and the Public Service Board. The Government is prepared to agree to the  chairman  of the proposed appeal board being chosen by the mutual, consent of the representatives of the employees and the' management. Failing mutual agreement, the nomination must be by the board of directors, which will have full control of the bank. The Government cannot see its way clear to accept an amendment which will require the Government to be continually intervening in the internal affairs of the bank. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment is consistent, logical, and reasonable. The proposal that there shall be " an independent chairman," appointed by the directorate, is a contradiction in terms. The board of directors will have complete control over the employees in respect of appointments, dismissals, promotions, rates of pay, and other working conditions which are likely to be the subject of appeal. The proposal that the  chairman  of the Appeal Board shall be appointed by the board of directors is a startling departure from recognized industrial practice. A  chairman  so appointed would be beholden to, and dependent upon, the directorate. The honorable member for Hindmarsh, however, has asked that the  chairman  shall be a person mutually agreed upon by the representatives of the employer and the employees, and that, failing such an agreement, the Government shall accept the responsibility of making an appointment. The Treasurer drew a false analogy between the Public Service Board and the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Public Service Board certainly administers the Service, Parliament retains a good deal of control; but the Commonwealth Bank directorate will be an independent body, placed in absolute authority over the employees of the institution. If the board appoints as  chairman  of the Appeal Board a person who is not <inline font-style="italic">persona grata</inline> to the employees, they will have no confidence in it. They will believe that they are offered a right of appeal from Caesar to Caesar, and the object of creating the appeal board will be defeated. Satisfaction and efficiency can only be secured by removing all suspicion from the appointment of the  chairman.  Having had seventeen years' experience of clerical workers, including bank employees, I understand fully the circumstances that may arise if the Government will not agree to the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. The past relations between the management of the Commonwealth Bank and its employees have left much to be desired. The management deliberately victimized many of the employees who had the courage and independence to join a trade union of bank employees. That victimization took various forms. I know of some officials, who had settled in New South Wales, and acquired homes there, who, because they had joined the union, were transferred to Tasmania or some other state. As a result of that policy the first attempts to form a union of Commonwealth Bank employees were practically defeated, and were renewed only because the employees recognized that without industrial organization they could do very little. Having regard to past experience, why does the Government propose this anomaly of an independent  chairman  appointed by the employer? Failing an agreement by mutual consent, let the Government accept the responsibility of appointing a  chairman.  The union that represents banking employees desires that the clause shall be amended in the way suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and as that will involve no drastic departure from a generally accepted principle, the union's wishes should be respected. The Bank Clerks Union was formed as the result of the economic hardships under which bank clerks were labouring. Their wages were scandalously low ; they were virtually the helots of industry. </para>

                        <para>- When the bank employees organized they had to fight stubbornly to get recognition. The union had to expend thousands of pounds to get registration, and many more thousands of pounds to get an award of the Arbitration Court. Incidentally, certain of its members were victimized. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rawson,</inline> of the Bank of New South Wales, because he took an active part in union affairs, was transferred, I think, to Goulburn with reduced status. The union applied to the New South Wales Arbitration Court for Rawson's reinstatement. This was. the first appeal of the kind. The associated banks briefed several lawyers, and the union spent many thousands of pounds in fighting the case on principle. Ultimately Rawson was reinstated by the court, and the award was practically the industrial <inline font-style="italic">magna carta</inline> of the bank employees. But for their success in that case victimization would have been more general. I do not suggest that the employees of the Commonwealth Bank were treated as badly as were those in the employ of the private banking companies, but they, too, have been victimized. Recently attempts have been made to intimidate them and to apply " forcible persuasion " to prevent them becoming members of. the union. Therefore, the acceptance of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh is desirable. If the employees of the Commonwealth Bank refuse to go before an appeal board., presided over by a nominee of the ' ' bosses, ' ' they will have the right to take such appeals affecting internal matters between the bank and its individual employees before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and that procedure will involve the bank in expensive litigation and friction. That will not be in the public interest. The Commonwealth Bank should be a model employer, and provide every facility that would conduce to efficiency and contentment in the service. </para>

As the bank is to have command of an immensely increased capital, which will enable it to extend its activities in many directions, it is essential to its welfare that it shall have a contented and efficient service. I ask honorable members opposite to take a common-sense view of this proposal. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> and the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R.

                <para class="block">It is customary in many forms of agreements - share-farming agreements, for instance - to provide for the appointment of three arbitrators when there is a possibility of disputes arising. Two arbitrators are appointed, one by each side and they mutually agree upon a  chairman.  If they fail to agree, provision is made for the appointment of a  chairman.  There- never appears to. be any difficulty about the appointment. The  chairman  is generally a local lawyer, who knows the conditions and customs of the place. One difficulty that I can see is that the two members of the board may refuse to agree, and, as a. consequence, a large number of appeals will have to be heard by three members. If the general practice can be relied upon as a guide, at least 90 per cent of the appeals will be heard by three members. Each of the two members may try to support his own side. I cannot understand why we should give two out of three representatives to one side to- the dispute. </para>

                        <para>- A board of directors lays down the conditions under which its employees work. For example, the Government could appoint, as a  chairman,  a member of the Public Service Board who. would be acceptable to both sides. As the Government owns the bank, it should have some say in the settlement of disputes within it. I cannot admit that the board of directors is not a party to a dispute, for it virtually employs the staff in the bank. It may be found that the chairmanship, of the board will be a full-time appointment, but I hope not. It would be a wrong thing to appoint a biased  chairman.  It has been said that the Government does not want to be " mixed up " in the matter, but it cannot be held that the Government would be " mixed up " in it by appointing an independent  chairman. </para>

                    <para>. - The discussion seems to have arisen owing to a misapprehension of the facts. The Senate's amendment inserts two sub-sections in the proposed new sub-section  16b.  If honorable members will look at clause  8  of the bill, they will see that they have quite misunderstood its intention. The proposed new  section, as agreed to by both Houses, reads - "(1.) Where an officer of the Bank is affected in his employment by the action of any authority of the Bank other than the Board, the officer may, within the prescribed time, submit in writing an appeal to the Board. "(2.) An appeal under this section shall state fully the action appealed against and the grounds of the appeal." </para>

                <para>The Senate proposes to add the following new sub-sections :  - "(3.) The Board shall refer the appeal to an Appeal Board consisting of three members, one of whom shall be appointed by the Board and one of whom shall be elected by the officers of the Bank in the manner prescribed, with an independent Chairman appointed by the Board. "(4.) The Appeal Board shall consider any appeal referred to it under this section and shall submit its report thereon to the Board, which shall determine the appeal and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive." </para>

                        <para>- If it does not, that is simply because it is taken for granted. A dispute could arise between members of the staff and the Governor of the bank. The Governor is to be a member of the board of directors. He may have discussed some proposed change with the board, and the board may have approved of it. When the change is made it may lead to a dispute with the staff. The dispute is to be sent to the board of directors, which sends it on to an appeal board. The object of sending the dispute to an appeal board is that it may be decided by an independent tribunal. I want the committee to realize what was in the mind of the Government when it framed the bill as originally introduced. The bill, as passed by this House, in spite of the protests from this side, provided that the only appeal which employees of the bank would have was to the board of directors. We objected to that, but were unsuccessful. When the bill was sent on to the Senate an amendment was made there. What was the object of that amendment? It was to secure an independent tribunal other than the board of directors. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that the Senate only half performed its task. ' It might as well have left the bill as it was. However, we can see what the intention of the Senate was. It was to remove the appeal from the board of directors so that it should not be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. No one would contend that the board of directors would be an independent tribunal, or that its chairman would be ah independent chairman. A dispute may conceivably, and in all probability will, be one in which the board of directors will be. implicated. It may arise out of a direction of the board to the Governor. This may be objected to and appealed against by an employee. The proposal of the Government is that the Appeal Board shall consist of one nominee of the employee, and two nominees of the board of directors. I give the Treasurer credit for being prepared to meet us part of the way, by agreeing to the appointment of an independent chairman by mutual agreement between the nominee of the staff and the nominee of the board of directors. So far, so good; but should a dispute arise between them as to who should be appointed chairman of the Appeal Board, who would decide that matter? We say that the Government should step in and decide it. The objection urged by the Treasurer that the Government should not be mixed up in the affairs of the bank is not a valid objection. We cannot avoid the Government stepping in at some point in the control of this bank. If honorable members will read the bill they will see that it contains provisions under which the Treasurer steps in in connexion with most important issues ; for instance, with regard to the issue of notes. In Victoria wages boards are constituted of representatives of employees and of. employers, who mutually agree to the appointment of an independent chairman. </para>

                <para class="block">They frequently disagree as to who should be  chairman,  and who appoints the  chairman  in such a  case? He is appointed by the Governor in Council. This might occur in connexion with the constitution of a wages board in the boot industry or in the coal-mining industry, and should it be necessary for the Governor in Council to appoint the  chairman  of the board, the Government will not, therefore, be a party to the dispute or be mixed up in it in any way. The proposal from this side is based upon precedent. If any persons stand for the wages board system in this country they are honorable members opposite, who prefer it to the Arbitration Court system. Yet they oppose the appointment of an independent tribunal, based on the Victorian wages board system, to consider appeals in connexion with disputes arising in the service of the Commonwealth Bank. We can only suggest that there must be some motive behind the refusal of- honorable members opposite to accept the amendment, and that the motive is that the Appeal Board shall be merely a farce. They wish to get back to the provision of the bill as originally introduced, and defeat the intention of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's interjection shows the necessity for the amendment we propose. Officers of the Commonwealth Bank have been tyrannized over because they formed a union to enable them to get to the Arbitration Court. There is evidence of victimization in the service of the bank for no other offence than that of organizing a union to enable the employees of the bank to get to the Arbitration Court. If the Treasurer requires proof of that statement he has only to make an investigation, and it will be proved. That was not the ostensible reason for the dismissal of certain officers, but we know that it was the real reason. If the policy of the management of the bank continues to be the policy of its management in the past, and involves the victimization of officers because they join their own union, a victimized officer will, under the Government proposal, have no appeal except to the very board responsible for his victimization. I cannot understand the Government objecting to the very fair proposal that has been made. It is of no use to suggest that it is merely a question of regulations or of a. senior officer inflicting hardship upon a junior. The really big issue to be considered will be the policy adopted by the board of directors with regard to the formation of a union amongst the employees to enable them to approach the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, in the settlement of a dispute such as I have suggested. We now give the  President  of the Arbitration Court power over all the public utilities of this country. The  chairman  of a wages board is given control over the industry with which it has to deal. The argument of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> is one which we met twenty years ago when wages boards were first established in this state. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer will make provision for an investigation into the matter we shall establish the truth of that statement. That is a challenge for the honorable gentleman to take up. If the honorable gentleman, as the responsible head of the department controlling the bank, will investigate the statement, evidence in support of it will be forthcoming without the slightest hesitation. The amendment of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> is only slightly different from that moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. We are not concerned as to who shall move a satisfactory amendment. If the honorable member for Richmond will do so, and thinks he can carry it, we shall be prepared to make way for him. The honorable member for Hindmarsh is not looking for personal kudos in the matter, but for an opportunity to see that justice is done to the officers of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                    <para>.- The discussion might lead some honorable members to believe that officers of the Commonwealth Bank are suffering great hardships. I believe that honorable members on both sides desire that the officials of the bank shall get fair play. I have no experience of the Commonwealth Bank, except as a depositor, though I have heard from some of the officers that they are harshly treated in many ways. But, whatever may have happened in the past, the bill provides for an appeal board to consider appeals by the employees. We have made provision for an appeal board for officers of the Public Service. The Public Service is governed by a board, the members of which are nominally the employers of the Service. The Commonwealth Bank Board, we are told, will also be nominally the employers of the bank. Thus the two institutions will be on all fours. It is proper, in those circumstances, that the Public Service Appeal Board and the Commonwealth Bank Employees Appeal Board should be constituted on similar lines. The Commonwealth Bank employees and the Commonwealth public servants both have the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court. If the motion is agreed to, the employees of the bank, like the Commonwealth public servants, will have the right to appeal to a board against any action, which they may consider to be unjust to them. The two services will thus be conducted on precisely similar lines. </para>

                        <para>- That is a quibble. The Public Service Inspector is the officer of the board. This bill provides that the board of directors of the bank shall have the right to appoint three of their members as an executive body, and I consider that when an appeal is made, the executive will appoint one member of the Appeal Board, the employee or employees concerned another, and if those two representatives cannot agree upon a chairman, the full board of directors of the bank will appoint one. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with that statement. If in the past the management of the bank has dealt harshly with its employees for their connexion with unionism, it has done wrong and has exceeded its rights. But the employees now have the right to approach the Arbitration Court, and if we give them the same appeal rights as public servants possess we shall be doing the fair thing. I feel convinced that the officers of the Commonwealth Bank would be well satisfied with a board constituted on the lines proposed in the Senate's amendment. We must give the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank credit for possessing some common sense, and they will doubtless show it by appointing an independent  chairman  to any appeal board that may be constituted. The Government will not be so interested in the affairs of the bank as are the bank's customers, and I cannot see any reason why it should have the right to appoint the  chairman  of an appeal board in case the parties concerned are not able to agree upon one. </para>

                    <para>.- It is difficult to appreciate the position of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr).</inline> Although he tells us that he stands for an absolutely impartial tribunal for the bank employees, he will not agree to an amendment which will attain that end. In cases where an .appeal board is necessary and the two members appointed by the employees and the board of the bank agree upon an independent  chairman,  no trouble will arise; but if they cannot agree, it seems to  me  to be an unreasonable proposition that the directors of the bank, having already appointed one member of the board, should have the right to appoint the  chairman.  It is quite conceivable that in many instances the representative of the aggrieved employee or employees, and the representative of the. board of directors of the bank, will not reach an agreement as to who shall be  chairman,  and in such cases it is only fair to provide that the  chairman  shall be appointed independently of both parties. If the board of directors of the bank have the right to appoint him, justifiable suspicion will arise as to his impartiality. The amendment has been moved in an absolutely non-party spirit, and it provides for exactly what the honorable member for Parkes desires, namely, an impartial tribunal . </para>

                    <para>. - I am unable to understand why the Treasurer will not accept the amendment, for it is reasonable and is submitted in a non-party spirit. The consensus of opinion among the employees of the bank is that an appeal board constituted on the lines suggested in the Senate's amendment would be " loaded " against them. The amendment at present proposed is designed to prevent such a- possibility. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> stated that the bank would not really  be  managed  by  the  board of directors, but  «I point out to him that the bill contains the following, provision : - </para>

                <para class="block">Wie know quite well that the board  of  directors will lay down conditions  of  .employment, and that the Governor, the Deputy  Governor)  and the managers in each of the states will receive their directions from the board, ,and will be subject to its dictation. The bank's general policy will be decided by the board, which will -be in the position of an employer. No doubt the Senate had very good intentions when it framed its amendment, but the  .establishment  of .an Appeal Board, .comprised of three -members, .one member -and the  chairman  appointed 'by the board of directors, and the other by -the officers, will be most unfair, .because it will give two representatives  to  -.the management, .and only one representative to the employees. This cannot .result in "harmonious' relations "between the management and the employees. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Makin)</inline> provides that in .case .of dispute the  chairman  -shall be appointed by mutual 'agreement between  ."tike  two parties, and failing that, by the 'Governor-General in 'Council.

This party, so long as the Commonwealth Bank employees receive fail- 'treatment, is willing to leave with Government supporters any credit that may be obtained from moving the amendment. In another place, when the bill was discussed, a certain honorable senator suggested numerous amendments which were inspired '"by the private banks. They were passed by the Senate, and are now being accepted by the Treasurer. Yet -he strongly opposes :an amendment  that  is designed to  meet the  requirements of thousands of "employees of  the  Commonwealth Bank. I as"k  .the  honorable member  for  Richmond  not  to be persuaded 'by the Treasurer  -to  withdraw his amendment. On  -the  l7th July, -last, I brought up in this House  "the  alleged victimization of certain 'Commonwealth Bank employees because of their -efforts to 'form in Brisbane :a :branch  of the  United Bank Clerks Association among -Commonwealth Bank" employees,. I shall not quote those .cases now ; I merely point out that after the branch was formed in Brisbane, according to the Brisbane press, a high official of the Commonwealth Bank arrived there -and Convened a meeting of the employees, at which he suggested that they should, .refrain from joining the association,, and instead should form a guild of employees within the bank. The employees also, received a circular from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kell,</inline> the Act-ing Governor, advising them not to form a union to be affiliated with the United Bank Clerks Association. The Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail,</inline> commenting on this -matter, published the following statement : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A number of conditions of employment of the Commonwealth Bank officials in Queensland are considered 'by the employees to be harassing and unfair, and consequently considerable .dissatisfaction exists. A call is made for an abnormal amount of night work, for which the employees receive no payment, nor (even meal allowances. . . . -While the -matter of salaries was .an important phase of the association's work, there  were  other matters of more pressing importance, and the question of the security of tenure by' the prevention of the instances recurring of employees being .arbitrarily dismissed &gt;at a moment's notice, with no right of appeal, was a most vital one. </para>
                    <para>The immediate outcome of these circulars, :said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Laidlaw,</inline> was -the issuing ,of a circular (by the  Acting Governor of the Commonwealth Bank <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. Kell),</inline> advising the staff not to join the association, but to form a separate guild. The only result has been that increased numbers of the employees have become .officers .of the  association. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That statement clearly shows that employees were not given that freedom and consideration to which they are entitled. There were also statements made of dismissals and transfers -of those who took a prominent part in union affairs. . "That showed the necessity for a fail' .Appeal Board. "When <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> brought this matter up in the House, the Treasurer promised to investigate -it. He communicated with the Acting Governor of the bank, who replied that the grievances .had been .grossly exaggerated .by agitators, no doubt for a purpose. It could not .be 'expected that a man giving such -a reply would mete -out justice to -the shank's .employees, .and ,yet he, under the Senate's amendment, will be one of the -board of directors, having the power to «appoint to the Appeal 'Board one representative, and also the  chairman.  The  employees, having only one representative, will at times lie unfairly treated with impunity. The Commonwealth Public Service Board is differently constituted, since it does not directly control such departments as the Postmaster-General's Department, the Treasury, and the Defence Department. That board exercises a supervision over staffs, organization, and procedure in the different departments, but does not interfere to any marked extent with the official heads of those departments. The board of management of the Commonwealth Bank will take a much more active part in the management of the bank. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Under the Public Service Act, honorable members have certain rights which, if necessary, will be exercised. But the control of the Commonwealth Bank is to be handed over to a board of directors beyond political control, really a board of autocrats, able to deal with employees as it thinks fit. It is no use asking when too late for a properly constituted Appeal Board. The opportunity is at hand. The bank officials are justified in their agitation for equal representation with the management on the Appeal Board. I hope that the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> will support the amendment, and rid himself of the belief that the bank's employees will be receiving justice under the Senate's amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the honorable member for Parkes has overlooked that fact. Commonwealth Bank employees have been victimized because they sought to form a union. For helping their fellow workers, they have been termed agitators, and in certain cases, I am informed, transferred to other centres. This form of victimization will recur if the employees do not have on the Appeal Board the same representation as the management. I have been asked by one of the employees of the Commonwealth Bank, who was taken over from the Queensland savings bank, to ascertain whether all rights that accrued to the Queensland savings bank employees were safeguarded in the bill. It was pointed out that these rights were not directly mentioned in the bill. I have made inquiries, and even the Acting Governor is not quite sure about the matter.  His  letter to me reads - </para>

                    <para>With reference to the amending bill (Commonwealth Bank), will you be kind enough to turn to clause 16 (a), covering certain privileges that are to be conserved to officers who have been transferred to the bank's service from other services, e.g., state or government savings bank of New South Wales or Queensland. As far as I can understand, no specific recognition of the rights held by officers of the Queensland Government savings bank is embodied in the clause mentioned, and it seems to me very necessary that these should be safeguarded in the same measure as any other body of officers similarly affected. In the agreement between the Treasurer of Queensland and the Governor of the bank, these privileges were retained to us, so that I assume that with any fresh legislation they will be automatically included, but it will make the situation much clearer to the hundreds of Queensland men affected if they see their rights properly protected under the clause put in the act for the purpose. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">An assurance by the Treasurer that the rights of these men are protected under the bill will make it unnecessary for me to move an amendment in that direction. These employees were taken over when the Queensland savings bank was merged into the Commonwealth Bank. The employees who were transferred should certainly know whether their rights will be preserved. If the Treasurer will give me an assurance, I will be satisfied. I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. It is a reasonable amendment, seeking only equal representation on the board of appeal for the employees and the management. No Appeal Board constituted as suggested by the Senate's amendment, loaded as it would be against the men - two representatives for the management and one for the employees - would suit the minority party in the dispute. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle- Page)</inline> directed attention to the fact that the Appeal Board" would deal with appeals against ";any authority of the bank other than the Board."" I' admit that the board of directors may not be a party to the appeal, but would be indirectly interested-, as the management is responsible to the board of directors for its actions and treatment of the staff. Consequently, there can be a  loading of- the1 dice- against the employees if the- board of directors- appoints two representatives on the Appeal' Board. Sub-sec^ tion 4 of the proposed new section provides that the- board' of directors' " shall determine the appeals" and* be- the- final arbiter. The board of' directors" appoints employees, and may take their positions away from them, and my amendment will not alter that It has: already been agreed that the- board: ©J directors shall appoint one member of th» Appeal Board, and that the employees abaft- appoint another member. The-  Government  has agreed to the appointment of a-  chairman  mutually acceptable to- the two' other members of the Appeal Board1. No- matter who- the  chairman  may be, or where he may come from, if the two- other members of the Appeal Board agree to his appointment, the Government will not object. If, however the two members of the board' cannot agree upon the appointment of a  chairman,  the Government says that the board of. directors, which already has one representative, shall have another, making, two out of three. I do not agree with that. The argument that the appointment of a  chairman  by the Government would lessen the prestige of the board of directors is answered in proposed new subsection 4",. which leaves the  finals  decision with the board of directors.. </para>

                    <para>.- Some honorable members on this side of the committee seem to find' a difficulty in understanding the attitude of honorable members opposite. Supporters of the Government profess to be anxious to establish an appeal court from which the employees of the bank may. expect to get justice,, but when we. submit an amendment to secure justice for the employees, those honorable members, as supporters- of the Government, refuse to accept it. Personally, I can see' no difficulty in explain, ing their actions, for while they may be prepared: to see justice done to the- employees, they remember- that, historically, as a political party and a government, they represent those- who have always refused te give any rights to ordinary employees. That has been* their consistent political policy, and to-day they feel' it incumbent upon them1 to uphold ifr. It is quite pleasant to me to observe that there are exceptions. The amendment,, in the first place&gt; was- moved by the honorable member- for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).,,</inline> who gave way to the honorable member for- Richmond- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green-).</inline> It is refreshing to- find that even on the other side some honorable members say that justice should be provided for the employees- in every case. They have so much- regard for justice that they say that even ordinary employees should have some  prospect of  securing  it,  for  it  stands before  any so-called political policy that? their party has- fashioned and followed in the past. There is a great principle involved in the amendment. When we set up an appeal court for employees <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> first quality it should have is that of being free from prejudice. The members of it, and especially the  chairman,  should be free from any suspicion of bias. The nearer we get to that the better the Appeal" Board will be. In all appeals there is a conflict between two. parties. Each side has its own representative, and it is desirable that the third party - the  chairman  - should be a man who is not concerned! in the. dispute, is absolutely independent and maybe expected to administer justice impartially. For those reasons we, on this side, stand for the appointment of independent chairmen on all Appeal Board's, for only by that means will the appellant be able to secure justice. I challenge honorable members opposite to deny that the carrying of the amendment will provide a fairer appeal court than will be provided if the  proposal  of the Government is accepted. Even the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> will not deny that we ought to strive to  get  the fairest possible board in. all cases. Why, then, will not honorable members accept; the amendment? I want to know that,  and  the bank employees will want to know it also. So far, no honorable member has stated why he will not accept the fairest possible appeal court. The chief argument of the honorable member for Parkes seemed to be that the Civil Service had no appeal court that was absolutely  fair,  and since we had not given a just appeal court to the Civil Service, we should not give one to the bank employees- </para>

                <para class="block">Board gives- satisfaction. The employees accepted it as the best they could wring from a hostile Government, but they are by no means satisfied with it, because they know that it does not always give them justice. The honorable member challenged us to cite cases of dissatisfaction or injustice.I am not going to mention cases, but I could, on the spur of the moment,citethree or four, and I have heard honorable  members  refer  to a number of others in which the appellant was dissatisfied with the decision of the board for the reason; generally, that the  chairman  was not independent. I consider that there was great harshness and injustice in several cases that have come within my personal knowledge. It is surely a poor argument to say that because we have not given absolute justice to the civil servants we should not give it to the Commonwealth Bank employees. The Government professes to be very anxious to provide the appeal court, but the test of its sincerity lies in the kind of court <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is prepared to create. If it is prepared to set up the fairest possible court; we on this side will say that it. is absolutely sincere; but if it creates a court that is an appeal court in name only, its sincerity will be doubted. I. shall not say that honorable gentlemen opposite are making " deliberate misstatements," but. I shall say that they are prepared to set up an appeal court in. which the employees of the bank can have no confidence. We are asking, the Government not. to sacrifice in any way the interests of the bank or of the people, but to. consent to the establishment of a tribunal which will do justice to the employees of the bank. It is said that. the. employees can go. to the Arbitration Court and that there is therefore, little or no need for the appointment of an Appeal Board. I. point out that the Arbitration Court seldom deals with matters of administration; classification,, promotion- and so on. It will not deal with matters of internal administration, and it is in. connexion with these very matters that conflicts are likely to arise between the. employees of. the bank and its authorities. There is, therefore, room for- the two tribunals. </para>

We think that it is necessary that there should be a. court to which the employees of the bank may appeal, and from which they can expect just decisions. The "employees of the bank also think such a court of appeal necessary. Honorable members on the other side apparently do not think that any tribunal of this kind is necessary. I ask them to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Richmond, and agree to the appointment of an Appeal Board consisting of a representative of the employees, a representative of the directors, and a  chairman  who will be entirely independent and without prejudice. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to reply to one or two statements made during the debate which I regard as unfortunate. It has been suggested that there is an analogy between the Public Service Board and the proposed board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank.' I rise to say once more that there is no analogy! between them. The board of directors of the bank will have complete control over its employees. In the case of the Public Service this Parliament exercises certain powers and authority. Furthermore, by the Arbitration Public Service Act of 1920 the officers of the Commonwealth Public Service are allowed to appeal to an independent appeal body known as the Public Service Arbitrator. They can bring before the Arbitrator individual cases involving matters of principle. I submit that the assertion of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> that the Public Service Board has brought about contentment in the Service as a result of its administration and its power to decide appeals, is incorrect, more particularly in view of the events that are taking place at the present moment. </para>

                        <para>- Then I must have misunderstood the honorable member. The fact remains that there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction in the Public Service at the present time, and organizations concerned have had to state individual cases to the Public Service Arbitrator in order to secure justice. For the purpose of illustration, I mention the case of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glanville,</inline> who was refused accrued seniority rights because he resigned from the Service to go to the war. He appealed to the Public Service Arbitrator to give him an award whereby he could secure the rights to which he considered he was entitled. The public servants have in the Public Service Arbitrator a tribunal that, enables them to secure satisfactory redress for their multifarious grievances. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank have the right to go to the federal Arbitration Court, but any one who has anything to do with arbitration cases, knows full well that the courts usually refuse to do more than prescribe a minimum wage unless the circumstances are so strong that more liberal action is necessary. The authority of the Public Service Arbitrator is not limited in any way. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank, however, will find that the Arbitration Court acts within a limited jurisdiction fixed by itself as well as by statute. It will not interfere with internal classification, promotions, gradations, and so on, but, as a rule, will only prescribe minimum wages. This makes it all the more necessary that there should be an independent tribunal to which the employees of the bank may appeal. The amendment, if agreed to, would give the proposed Appeal Board a certain amount of respect, and would enable it possibly to do some useful work. Honorable members on this side have shown a non-party spirit in agreeing to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green),</inline> and I trust the Treasurer will accept it. The fate of the Government will not depend upon the amendment, and it would not be embarrassed by its accceptance. </para>

As a large percentage of its supporters come from that class, the Government is undoubtedly riding for a political fall. It should at least give these workers a " fair go." </para>

                <para>Mr.WEST . (East . Sydney) [8.14]..- When the Labour Government first asked Parliament to give control of the note issue to the "Notes "Issue "Board,the Opposition, which included some of the honorable members who are supporting this Government, attacked the proposal violently. It was said that grave danger threatened the financial stability of the country. I am astonished that within  a few years the hard things that were then said have been forgotten. Both the Labour Government of that day and its supporters were -held up to ridicule throughout the country.It was said that more rascals were associated with that Government than could be found anywhere else in Australia among the same number of men. The Government now propose to place the note issue under political control, because notes will not be issued without the approval of the Treasurer. Ido not see the danger from this practice that is imagined by some persons. I know very well that whentheLabour party gains the Treasury bench, the note issue will not lay dormant if a useful purpose can be served by increasing the circulation. Unfortunately the amendment proposed by the Government is designed to serve certain individuals and not the general community.Theboard of directors., when requiring an issue of notes, will apply to the Government for it. If the bill is passed there will "be nothing to prevent the government of the day from applying to the Commonwealth Bank for a loan of £6,000,000 to construct, say, the north-south railway. The interest charged on the loan could be used to reduce the <inline font-style="italic">debt,</inline> and -to prevent 'inflation. Notes to the value of the debt redeemed could be destroyed each year. In a few years the debt would thus be wiped out altogether. The note issue should be used unstintingly for national purposes. We are told that the reason for this innovation is the difficulty of exchange, 'but it is not so. The true reason is that since . 1.914 the liabilities of certain banks have grown considerably. At that time the liabilities of private banks were £168,000,000; to-day they are £312,000,000. Without those liabilities there would be no need for an alteration in the present note issue. Any one who has closely watched the banking journals and the daily newspapers must know, that pressure has been brought to bear upon the Government by banks which have incurred large liabilities, and which consequently fear loss of business owing to not being able to satisfy -their customers' requirements to the same extent as banks whose liabilities are not so great. Before the Commonwealth took over the note issue, the franks received the benefit of the loss of notes by fire and other means. There was a great disparity between the number of notes issued and the number accounted for. The Labour  Government  maintained that the country should receive the benefit of the loss of notes, and that was one of the reasons why the Commonwealth took over the note issue and made notes legal tender,. The Government must be responsible for the bill, as no opportunity is given for its amendment. The directors appointed to the board will be under political influence. Their only credentials will be their intimacy with politicians. The placing of the note issue under political control is an evidence that the finances ofAustraliaare not being managed in the best interests of the people. The note issue should be used for the construction of public works. The "interest payments on such a loan would in a few years wipe out the total debt. I am not the originator of this idea. It was carried out in the island of Jersey or Guernsey for the erection of market places.I am not a pessimist, but I foresee that unless the utmost caution is exercised Australia's financial position will soon be very serious. The policy of" safety first "should be applied to our finances. The Common- wealth has £410,000,000 worth of deadweight, debt' which returns no interest, and the proposal to issue notes to the private banks will not wipe out that liability. I have been a candid friend of the Government in regard to finance; and my criticisms have been admitted by commercial men to be sound. Some banks are pressing the Government to consent to the issue of more notes but others which have been more cautious in the acceptance of liabilities, are not so much in need of such assistance. I hope that, notwithstanding the Government's misconception of the functions of a national bank, some good will come out of this institution. To-day Australia' is living on credit, and all the talk about a return to a gold currency' is so much nonsense. The vaults of the United States of America are filled with gold which was sent there to restore the exchange balance between America and Europe. But of what use is all that gold to the American people ? If investing the Treasurer with power to veto the issue of notes to the Commonwealth Bank does not mean political control of the no te issue,I do not understand the English language. </para>

                        <para>,. - It was felt in some quarters that a provision should be inserted in the bill which would prevent the bank issuing an undue amount of notes to itself and' so causing" inflation. Therefore, the amendment provides that notes shall not be issued to the bank without the approval of the Treasurer. That will practically ensure that the central bank shall not use the note issue for general bank purposes in competition with the private banks. </para>

                        <para>-  If  there is one institution in the country that has definite security to offer, it is the Commonwealth Bank. It, like the private banks, can receive additional notes only after depositing the requisite security.  If  both private banks; and the national bank have security to offer  to  the issuing authority why should not they have equal rights? What would the Treasurer say if, following a change of government, the restriction upon the issue of notes to the national bank were withdrawn, and the issue  of  notes to the private banks were forbidden, no matter how good the security they offered without the approval of the Treasurer?" This amendment involves the direct application of political influence to the note issuing authority, and, so long as the private banking institutions can; exert political pressure, it will be directed against the Commonwealth Bank. No matter what security the national institution has to offer, it is to be prevented from issuing notes to itself without the approval  of  the Treasurer, lest it compete unduly, with the private banks in order to obviate this unfair discrimination,.  I  suggest that the amendment Be altered to read',. " pro-viding thatAustralian notes shall not be issued to any bank without the approval  of  the Treasurer." </para>

It is stipulated in section 60 o that the Commonwealth Bank shall not" obtain notes until it has deposited the same security as is required from private banks, but a discrimination is now proposed, for in the case of the Commonwealth Bank the approval of the Treasurer is required. If there is any discrimination, it should be the other way about. The argument has been put forward that there should be no political control of the Commonwealth Bank. There can be no argument against political control of the private banks, but there is an argument against political control of the Commonwealth Bank. The amendment of the Senate provides for political control of the Commonwealth Bank, and no control of private banks. I do not know whether the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> will fit in with the section, but it embodies a desirable principle. What justification is there for altering the original law? </para>

                        <para>- I believe it would, because the principal act stipulates that the private banks and the Commonwealth Bank shall be on the same footing. The argument used in the Senate was that it was desirable to prevent the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank from issuing notes to themselves. That is a sound argument, and it is met by the provision in the principal act that the Commonwealth Bank can only receive notes by giving credit to the Note Issue Department upon the same terms and conditions as are applicable to other banks. If the directors of the Commonwealth Bank would issue notes to themselves without security, they could issue them on the same terms to private banks. The Government ought to agree either to oppose the Senate's amendment or to accept the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is not intended to discriminate against the Commonwealth Bank ; the endeavour is to serve the public interest. If the Commonwealth Bank was a central bank, purely and simply, there would be no need for any restriction on its note issue, beyond that provided in the act, and notes would be issued against certain classes of security, such as gold, Commonwealth Government and British Government securities, and trade bills. But as the Commonwealth Bank is at the same time a central bank and a trading bank, there is some justification for a fear that notes may be issued to the trading part of the bank in such excessive quantities as to interfere with the central banking part of the business. In that way the central banking part might be prevented from functioning properly in stabilizing banking. The Senate's amendment is reasonable, but I am not in love with the way the limitation is made. If any honorable member can suggest a better safeguard, I shall be prepared to accept it. </para>

                    <para>.- I feel sure that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> if left to himself, would not endorse the Senate's amendment. The section in the principal' act is sound, and was accepted by members of all .parties at the time. The Nationalists, who were then in opposition, protested that the Labour party would discriminate in favour of the national bank as against private corporations, and in order to remove that objection it was expressly  stipulated in the act that there should be no discrimination. The principle of no' discrimination has been accepted as sound. Is there any justification for discriminating between one institution and another, or between one individual and another? Every institution in the country, whether national, municipal, or private, should have the same privileges in obtaining national currency for securities lodged. It is proposed to destroy that principle at the very root. The Senate's amendment is not based on equity or morality, but on the principle of private profiteering. It is designed to protect the private banking corporations, and the Government has accepted it without any pretence of justification. The only plea put forward in support of this outrageous proposal is that the bank will be a general bank, a central bank, and a bank of issue. These will be three distinct departments, and they will be managed by three distinct authorities, who are to be appointed. The men who will be entrusted with the management of this great institution, and will handle millions of public and private money, should be honest men, capable of acting with fairness and equity to all. The Government's justification for the Senate's amendment is that they will not act in accordance with the principles of equity, and will not exercise good judgment and wisdom, but will issue notes without proper security. There is no justification for that assumption, and no justification for the amendment, which is an outrageous discrimination between a national institution and private corporations,- to the detriment of the national institution. There is only one safe principle to lay down, and that is that whoever can offer security to the issuing department should be able to obtain the equivalent in notes. If the Commonwealth Bank is to continue to exist as a general bank, it must be given the same privileges as private institutions; it must be able to go to the Note Issue Department and present its securities in the same way as any other bank. It is not suggested that the manager of the Bank of Australasia, if he deposited securities and received £1,000,000 worth of notes, should be subject to interference by the Treasurer. Who will be the guardian of the nation in that case ? </para>

                        <para>- No, but the Government evidently imagines that the men it will appoint to conduct the institution will do so to the detriment of the nation, or of corporations or individuals in it. It is imagined that they will be so incapable that it will be necessary for the Treasurer to act in the role of guardian of the public interests. It is evident that the manager of the trading branch of the Commonwealth Bank will be seriously handicapped in the conduct of its business if he is not placed on the same footing as, say, the manager of the Bank of Australasia. The Government might as well discriminate between two private banks. It might direct the Commonwealth Bank to issue notes to" the Bank of Australasia while forbidding it, without the approval of the Treasurer, to issue them to the Bank of New South Wales. Upon what basis can the Treasurer assume that the . Note Issue Department would issue notes properly to the Bank of Australasia, and improperly to the Bank of New South Wales. I assume that the department of issue will be quite distinct- from the other departments of the bank - as distinct as the bank of issue in the Bank of England is from the other departments of that bank. The whole thing is a bare-faced discrimination against the Commonwealth Bank in the interests of private banking corporations. It is a bare-faced attempt to place the Commonwealth Bank at a disadvantage as compared with the private institutions. If honorable members on this, side were in power to-morrow and proposed to reverse: this proposal and enact that no' notes should be issued to any private bank without reference to the Treasurer of the country, a howl of indignation would go up from supporters of the present Government against a proposal to discriminate against the private banks in the interests of the national bank of the country. It would be said that it was an attempt to drive private banks out of business. I warn honorable members opposite, and also the private banking institutions of this country, that they are in this matter making a rod for their .own backs. We know the force that is behind the Government. Principles are being embodied in the bill which would be denounced as odious by  the  'Kepi  esentatives  .of  the  priMate-banks if  they were embodied in  ra  Commonwealth Bank Bill proposed -by the Labour (party. Honorable members opposite and 'those by whom .they ,are being n coerced in 'this matter may  find  -these principles extended -against .themselves. There tare two courses which w.e -can take .in .the matter. W.e can, in  :the first .place,, -vote against the -Senate's amendment, and that we shall .do. Under , the .exis'ting act it is .provided that :there shall be no discrimination 'be|tw&gt;een .private -banks and -the '.Commonwealth Bank, and that all private banks .shall have .the same privilege as  the  national bank  of  the country  of  .access to the note issue on the "basis  .of  security. It is provided that the Commonwealth Bank shall enjoy  no .privilege .in this connexion which is .not also  enjoyed  by a private :hank. This .has been the law  for  years- .in ;this country, but it is .now .proposed -to alter it, and to .establish discrimination "in the interests  of  private banking 'corporations .and .against .the Commonwealth Bank. The  object  is that .the Commonwealth Bank shall be .'handicapped.

He -told  ais  .that the .bill .was originally .introduced -without the proviso which has come from the .-Senate. He said there  &gt;wa3  no  Attempt  to discriminate against the Common-wealth Bank, but that some .safeguards .are necessary because the .Commonwealth .-Bank is more than a central bank. If it were ,only -a grand clearing house of the .associated banks, &gt;we know .that these .would be no necessity for this provision, .because <inline font-style="italic">*t</inline> would never .be -a -claimant for .notes. If .the Government turned the Commonwealth Bank into merely ,a central bank, it .would do only discount -work tas a clearing .house .for .the other .banks, -and would not .require notes. It is preposterous to .say that .because -the Commonwealth .Bank is also a .trading bank, it for .that reason must .be discriminated against, and the Treasurer .must , ha,ve the right to say whether it .shall .have .the notes for which it asks, irrespective of .the security it offers. The' idea which the proposal conveys to my mind is that those who are -responsible 'Tor it are determined that the 'gentlemen who are -to be appointed to the board 'tff directors -of 'the Commonwealth Bank shall function in the interests of the .associated (banks, or., if they do -not, that the Treasurer  :shall  make them -do so. There .must be some reason .'for .the Treasurer's refusal  ito  accept the .amendment  ,of  the .Acting Leader of the Opposition. :The honorable member "for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitsitt,)</inline> is .at this moment in conversation with the Treasurer. "I can quite understand why the  honoraBle  member wants a conference with the "Treasurer on this matter.

Their attitude on this amendment is absolutely inconsistent with that which they adopted .on the amendment which we -considered -on Friday, dealing with the constitution .of -the hoard .of directors. Honorable members opposite then .contended that -the -men who might he appointed to the directorate would not act properly. <inline font-style="italic">Mow,,</inline> .when we are considering an .amendment which  would restrict the powers of the directors of the bank, in a way which I candidly admit I do not think advisable, honorable members opposite -contend that the restriction is unreasonable, 'because It is impossible to imagine that the men who would "be appointed 'to the board -of directors of the Commonwealth Bank would so far abuse their trust as to issue -notes without security. I remember that in my young days we were sometimes asked .to demonstrate certain problems of Euclid by the <inline font-style="italic">reductio ad absurdum</inline> method. That .seems to me to be what -the Acting Leader of the -Opposition -has just attempted to do. He considered the Senate's amendment to be absurd, land moved his amendment to show how .absurd it really is. The note issue -department of the bank should not be under any .control by the Treasurer, but should he able to issue notes on .acceptable securities to either .the Commonwealth Bank .or the private banking .companies. </para>

                        <para>- I realize that. Surely we can trust the members of the board of directors of the bank not to abuse the privilege which they will have of issuing of notes. They will be men of integrity. Doubtless the Senate amended the clause to remove any possibility of the directors, in a time of financial stringency when the bank was sorely pressed, yielding to the temptation to take an easy way out of their troubles by issuing notes for the use of the bank. I do not think that it is at all likely that they would be tempted to do such a thing. I am certain that the present Acting Governor, whom I have known for many years, would not think of doing it. The Treasurer will do well if he asks the committee to reject both the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition and that of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- The Acting Leader of the Opposition did not move the amendment for the purpose of having it defeated, as suggested by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning).</inline> Had he done such a thing he would have been unfaithful to his duty. The -Labour party is here to do business and to protect as far as it can the bank which it established. I heartily agree with the principle which is at the basis 'of the amendment. Its object is to hold the Treasurer responsible for any inflation of the currency. If it is adopted it will restore to Parliament a proper measure of control over the note issue. I assert without fear of contradiction that nothing can so seriously affect the wellbeing of the community as currency inflation. It may be said that the note issue will be placed under political control if the amendment is agreed to. I admit that the Treasurer would have a measure of control, but he would not have the power to initiate a movement for the inflation of the currency. All he would be able to do would be to give his approval for or against it. The power of initiation would rest with the note issue department of the bank. But while I agree with the general principle that the Treasurer should have some control of the note issue, I certainly do not agree with the Senate's amendment, which will make discrimination between ' the Commonwealth Bank and the private banking companies inevitable. I can quite understand the attitude of the honorable member for Macquarie. Some weeks ago he delivered an address in this chamber which indicated his strong desire to inflate the currency. In view of all the circumstances I shall vote for the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, but if it is defeated I shall be compelled to vote against the Senate's amendment, for the reason that I am entirely opposed to discrimination between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banking companies. It would be absolutely unjust to the Commonwealth Bank for us to agree to such a thing. "We should rather be doing everything possible to promote the interest of our bank, for in the last half-year it has made available £60,000 of its profits for the reduction of the national debt. Honorable members will fail to do their duty if they do not stand up for the bank and assist it in every possible way. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not see the need for the Senate's amendment. I certainly do not favour any discrimination between the Commonwealth Bank and the associated bank in the issuing of notes. Not a single note "should be issued to any institution unless the issuing authority is given gold security for it. We should have an equivalent in gold for all our notes, and until we have it we cannot claim that we are financing on sound lines. Of course, there is some virtue in printing notes. It provides work for the printers. The £1 note issued by the Commonwealth has the following promise on it: - </para>

                <para class="block">As a matter of fact, a note without proper security behind it is only worth the paper it is printed on. Honorable members must recognize that they cannot get money out of nothing, nor can they get it off a printing press. Certain individuals in Australia have been offering millions of German marks for sale for 5s., but the paper is worth nothing at all. The only real object in issuing notes is to save the wear and tear on gold. Notes are lighter to carry, and more easily handled than gold, but as currency they are only valuable in the degree to which they are backed by gold. The Government recently borrowed another 5,000,000 <inline font-style="italic">£1 "</inline> flimsiest." I would like to know why it has done so. If it needed more money it should have obtained it from the surplus. I sincerely trust that we shall deal with the business of this country seriously, and not. imagine that we are wealthy simply because the banks have a lot of printed paper in their possession. Our industries and finance generally can only be stabilized by a return to the gold standard. I hope that the control of the note issue will be entirely .removed from the Treasurer. The' banking companies know best what currency they require, and we shall do well to provide that notes shall be issued only in the degree to which gold is available as security for them. I am not in favour of issuing one note either to the Commonwealth Bank or to the associated banks, unless they have the equivalent in gold. I trust that the Treasurer will withdraw the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  Honorable' members on both sides have spoken on this amendment. I have explained the reason why it was inserted by the Senate, and I have already indicated that the safeguard given may not be the best that could be devised. It has the disadvantage of practically putting the Treasurer in perpetual control of the note issue, as every matter concerning the issue of notes by the Commonwealth Bank would have. to be brought before him. A suggestion has been made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> to alter the amendment to provide that Australian notes shall not be issued to any bank without, the consent of the Treasurer. If that amendment were carried, not merely the first issue of notes, but also all subsequent issues by the Commonwealth Bank to other banks would have to be approved by the Treasurer. In view of the general concurrence of opinion expressed by honorable "members, the Government is willing to negative the Senate's amendment. This will also negative the amendment suggested by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. </para>

We  as the custodians of the people must look after them for good or for evil. Nothing can be made more an instrument for ill, so far as the community is concerned, than the inflation of currency. By the withdrawal of the  Senate's amendment no control in any shape or form will be exercised by this Parliament, and I regret that the Treasurer has seen fit to withdraw the amendment. </para>

This provision will  not  cause discrimination between the banks, but is intended to put all on the same basis. At present other banks cannot obtain notes except under the control of the Notes Issue Board, but the Commonwealth Bank can, under the- bill as originally drafted, issue to itself notes without any control. </para>

The amendment prevents rather than encourages discrimination. On the other hand; the amendment proposed: by the Acting Leader of the Opposition is to increase discrimination, because if were made the private banks could obtain notes only with the approval of two institutions - the bank and the Treasury.. There is a difference between the Commonwealth Bank acting as a check on other banks and acting to facilitate its own operations.

                        <para>- The- honorable member does not seem to be able to distinguish between the general branch of the Commonwealth Bank and the Board of directors of the Central Bank. If those in control of the general branch of the Commonwealth' Hank require notes, they apply to the Notes Issue Department just as do the managers of private banks. Under the principal act they have to lodge with the Notes Issue Department the same security as private banks. That is the last to-day. The Senate's amendment proposed that the Treasurer of the day should act asa brake upon the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, and should give a free hand to private institutions. I am glad that the Government has decided not to allow such a discrimination. Even if the interpretation of the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Manning) of this party's amendment were right, I regard it as only fair to defeat a proposal by reducing it to an absurdity: A <inline font-style="italic">reductio ad absurdum</inline> is certainly not a ridiculous way of defeating an argument. It has been tried, and" proved very effective on many occasions,, and not ineffective on this occasion. Our amendment was. moved, not for the purpose of. defeating, the Senate's amendment, but with the object of putting upon private banks the same restriction as was placed on the Commonwealth. Bank. The position' as stated by the honorable member is not correct. The law now provides that the Commonwealth Bank cannot secure notes under better conditions than private banks. </para>

                        <para>.- This, I should say, is the most vital amendment inserted by the Senate.. It provides that the board may issue Australian notes to the Commonwealth Bank or to other banks in Australia in exchange for money or securities lodged with the London branch of the bank. When the bill was before the Senate a long discussion took place. Honorable senators championed the cause of the private banking institutions. An amendment was moved that held up the bill. It was to the effect that the whole question of exchange and foreign credits should be referred to a commission of investigation. It was probably a very sound proposition, because no question requires investigation and elucidation. more than that of London credits. Al-  through statements have repeatedly been made that our credit in London is £40,000,000 or £50,000,000, yet any one who examines the trade statistics between Britain and Australia, compares the imports and exports; and estimates the amount, of interest that we have to pay on our public debt will arrive at a debit of something; like £15,000,000 instead of a credit of £40,000,000. Every one who has made an examinations of the figures says that the amount standing to our credit in London is about £40,000,000, but no one has ever come down to this chamber with any concrete evidence that such a credit is in existence. That credit may be real or it may be mythical, but, having regard to the excess of imports over exports, if it exists it is certainly a fast disappearing quantity. During the last four years the balance of trade has been against Australia' to the amount of probably £40,000,000. </para>

                <para>Mr-: SCULLIN.- We are in the anomalous position that the exchange rate is in our favour; but it is killing local industries, and handicapping: the export of primary products. Some investigation should be made by a competent authority to prove that Australia has real and tangible credits in London against  which  notes can be issued. Surely it is the responsibility of the Government to ascertain what those credits are.. </para>

I do not say that we have not a credit in London, but if we have there is something radically wrong with the figures that have been presented to this Parliament. However,. I rose mainly to relate the history of this amendment, and: to protest against then Government's acceptance of it.. When the bill left this chamber it contained no proposal for the issue of Australian currency against foreign credits; that involves a financial revolution. </para>

The action of Government supporters, the champions of the private banks, in holding, up the bill until the Government brought down an amendment to do what the Treasurer says the board already has power to do is significant. It means simply that the purpose of the amendment is not to give the board power to issue notes against foreign credits, but tor instruct it to do so. </para>

I admit that the original act gives the board power to do what the amendment purports to empower it to do. Why then do I oppose the amendment?. Because the conditions under which it is introduced carry an instruction to the board.

                    <para>The next proposal to be noticed is that notes -should be issued to the banks in Australia by the Notes Board, and that the board should take from the banks in exchange an equivalent amount of credits in London. Now this proposal is usually put forward in Australia in a somewhat loose manner. For example, we are not told how long the Notes Board is to hold this credit, and whether or not the Notes Board is to take the initiative in the disposal .of its London money. </para>

                <para class="block">Now that the Treasurer has adopted the principle that had been advanced "in a loose manner," does he intend to tighten it up? And will he answer the questions which he asked of the persons who were responsible for putting forward the proposal in a loose manner? Of course, he was referring to the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> who was at that time an independent critic of the Government. The Treasurer essayed to explain the amendment to the committee on Friday last, but did he answer the questions he had put to his colleague, the honorable member for Martin - " How long is the Notes Board to hold its credit? Is the Notes Board to take the initiative in the disposal of its London money?" He said not a word in answer to his own interrogations. What is the note issuing authority to do with its London credits? Is it merely to hold them as securities, or will it take them over permanently ? These are problems' that the Treasurer has not elucidated. He said on the 13th June - </para>

The result would be that not  merely  £10,000,000 would be added to the local currency, but cheque money manufactured by the banks would further add to the means of payment by from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000, according to the Treasurer's estimate.

                <para class="block">The Minister had carefully studied the question, and he made a very lucid and able analysis of the financial position at that time. It is against the disappearing credit to which he referred that Australian currency will be issued - against a credit the existence of which has to be proved. The reply will, no doubt, be that although the notes will be issued against disappearing assets, new assets will be created. What does that mean? The proposal to issue notes against foreign credits is to relieve Australia of a temporary difficulty, but when further goods are sold in the London market to redeem the notes, there will be inflation. </para>

They will finance the exports of wool and other goods from Australia, and thus will build up more credits in London. If we issue notes to the amount of £8,000,000, and credits are created to finance £80,000,000 worth of exports, we shall have £80,000,000 more of credits in London. Will that relieve the situation ? How are those credits to be transferred to Australia ? Will the bank issue more notes against more London credits? The Treasurer has not said how the situation will be relieved.

                        <para>- -I do not say that we should have a sovereign for every note issued; that is an absurdproposition.It is possible to inflate the currency by an over -issue ofgold;but agold <inline font-style="italic">currency</inline> would be automatically regulated, to some extent, if gold were allowed to be exported. There is much loose talk in blaming the note issue for high prices, and I am inclined to think that cause and effect have been confused. Prices soared in America where there was -more gold than they knew what to do with. My opinion is that high prices were due to the operations of war profiteers, who took advantage of the goods shortage to raise prices, and the currency had to be increased to meet the greater volume of trade. If prices are increased the currency must be increased. High prices were more the cause of the increased currency than the increases currency was the cause of high prices. If notes are to be issued against credits and wealth, Suggest that they should be issued against credits and wealth in this country. To solve the problem of foreign exchanges, we must do more manufacturing in this country, provide a bigger local market for ourproduce,and import less in manufactured goods. Ibelievethat only an expert investigation can prove whether we have any real assets in London against 'which -to issue currency.It is proposed to take away from the Notes Issue Board the discretionary power that the 'Treasurer has always said it should have. The amendment wields the big stick of political influence. Unless that is so, ithasnosignificance,sense, or meaning, and there was no meaning in the Senate holding up the bill until an agreement had been made with the banks. If the amendment is not a direction 'or instruction fromParliamentto the bank. it might , as well be withdrawn .If it is an instruction or direction as I maintain it is and as the evidence goes to show, it is political influence of the worst character exerted byaGovernmentthat says it is removing the bank from political influence. </para>

                    <para>. - The speech of the honorable member for Yarra(Mr. Scullin) is interesting, because the -accusation has been levelled at the Government that the bill was framed -by the private banks, who had dictated every line, and crossed every " t " and dotted every"i " . of it. Now we learn from the honorable member that it was 'held up in the Senate because it 'did not meet with the wishes of the private banks. Both those statements cannot betrue,and, in fact, neither of themis true. I should like to mention exactly what took place at -the meeting between the representatives of the banks and myself. The general managers of the banks in Sydney and Melbourne intimated to me that they would like to discuss some portions of the bill with me while it was still in the Senate. I said I would discuss it with them if they would come to the House.I met them, and they said that there was one thing they would like to have made quite clear.. They told me that there was a considerable diversity of opinion among bankers as to whether the Notes Issue Board had power to issue notes against securities held in London. I said that was an easy statement to answer, because the 'Commonwealth "Bank Act made the position perfectly clear. I told them that it was unfortunate if the provisions of the act had not been properly understood by everybody, and that there was no objection to making the powers of the bank quite clear in the amending bill. All the amendment does is to say that notes "may" he issued to the Commonwealth Bank, or other banks in Australia, in exchange for money or securities lodged with the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank. The amendment makes the position clear, is in no sense an instruction, and confers no additional power. The honorable member for Yarra did not attack its principle, and in my second-reading speech, I dealt with the subject at greatlength.I pointed out that the power existed, and that it was a power that the bank should exercise. I said that, for the exercise of that power, there should be in charge of the bank a board with a wide knowledge of finance,  and Australian and world affairs.I said- </para>

                <para>That is the general power which the Notes Board has had ever since 1920.It is worth noting that, although the Notes Board has had this power all thistime,it has never exercised it in connexion with UnitedKingdomsecuritiesor trade bills. One of the reason's why this central  bank is  being constituted at present, and is being given control of the note issue, is to enable these powers to be operated more satisfactorily and continuously than has been the case up to the present.The Notes Board has felt itself more or less out  of  the stream of banking and finance, and has felt that it could  exercise a much  more beneficial influence in the community at large, and especially in the control  of finance,  if it were in a position to use the securities it holds in this  way  to meet exchange conditions.Theway in which the provision would act is quite different from what the honorable member for Yarra suggests.Hesuggeststhatnotes would be issued in Australia for securities in London, and that the banks would immediately build up credit on that, and sub sequently build up credit again inLondon,andwould so create an increasing pile of credit. That is not what would take place. Theboard would take steps to sell its securities to ensure that there should be no inflation.It is because it has not been an  a position  to deal with securities in this  way that it  has been more or less hampered in  the  past. This provision is part and parcel  of  the central banking system, and will enable the bank  to  make its securities liquid, instead of immobile, as they are at present. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> intimated that it was the influence of the banking corporations that prompted these suggestions. The Treasurer says that that is not so, and that this provision was not in the bill as originally introduced. I am not blaming the Government in the matter. It is up to the Government to do as much as it can for its friends. If people will not help their own, who will help them ? If the present Government does not look after its friends now it will never have a chance to do so later. In connexion with a public matter recently, I desired " the support of one of these gentlemen, and submitted to him a certain proposal. He said, " This is very fine, but I should like some changes made." I said, " Very well; I think we can come to terms; I shall strike out what you object to and put in what you want." A few days later, he said he had given further consideration to the matter, and that there were one or two paragraphs he would like to have omitted and a few items he would like to have inserted. I then said that I would accept everything he had suggested.  A few days still later, he came to me with a third request, and I said, " That's the end of it." But so far as the Government is concerned there is no end to the pressure of the banks. When this bill was originally introduced the private banks made a suggestion, and as they opened their mouths and had them filled they have come again and again for further supplies. I said on a previous amendment that the private banks were making a rod for their own backs. They are doing the same thing in connexion with this amendment. They are laying down fundamental principles. It was formerly a principle accepted and fought for in this House that the note issue must have' a gold backing. That has gone by the board. </para>

                <para class="block">The principle now accepted, put forward by the banking corporations and formulated by the Government in this bill, is that notes can be issued not on the basis of gold, but on the basis of paper securities, whether they be deeds, bonds, or bills for goods in transit. The Government endorses this new principle, and should any Government propose an extension of it the present Government and its banking friends outside will have no right to object. The third principle laid down by the amendment is that we shall not only issue the national notes on paper securities held within our own borders, but we may issue them based on securities held thousands of miles away from this country. </para>

                        <para>- I say that it is a principle which the honorable gentleman is putting forward, and he will have no ground of objection if to-morrow we should build on the principles he is now formulating. If the honorable gentleman can operate this principle in the interests of private banking corporations, he cannot object if to-morrow we .are in a position to do so and apply the principle in the interests of the nation. The Treasurer has formulated a principle that we may issue Commonwealth notes not merely upon securities within Australia but also upon securities held thousands of miles away, and entirely outside the jurisdiction, of the Commonwealth Government. The proposal is based upon the ground that there are immense securities held overseas. I have tried to obtain a few facts on the matter. I noticed the other day in one of the newspapers the statement made that there is no means of obtaining any sound knowledge as to the amount of securities or the amount of credits we have overseas. I direct the attention of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> to this matter. He made a speech recently on the subject of the international problem relating to exports and imports. I find, according to the record, that during the last four years we imported to this country goods to the value of £498,000,000, and exported goods to the value of £528,000,000. This gave us over the period of four years an excess of exports to the value of £30,000,000. These four years included 1920, our peak year for exports, but if we leave out 1920, and take the figures for only 1921, 1922, and 1923, they show that our exports during those three years amounted in value to £378,000,000, and our imports to £399,000,000, an excess of imports amounting to £21,000,000. If these figures tell the truth we axe in debit, and not in credit overseas. It has been most remarkable to hear that this country is in credit overseas. It is said that we have no means of knowing what our credit overseas is, but I say that there is a means of knowing. If one looks at the <inline font-style="italic">Bankers' Record,</inline> issued by the banking corporations, he will find that it shows the balance-sheets of the various banks and their oversea credits, as well as their credits in Australia. I find from this publication that in 1914 the private banks of this country had overseas' credits to the extent of £55,415,000. These consisted of trading accounts, £33,565,000; gold, £14,205,000; Government notes, £2,033,000; or gold and notes to the amount of £16,238,000. Government securities represented £4,427,000. Bank premises overseas were valued at £501,000, and notes and bills of other banks accounted for £684,000. The liabilities of the banks overseas amounted to £29,471,000. This gives a surplus of assets over liabilities overseas of £26,000.000. In pre-war times the banks had enormous assets overseas. In 1920 the surplus of assets over liabilities was £48,000,000.  The assets were given as £120,000,000, and the liabilities as £72,000,000. That was the peak year. In 1921 the surplus of assets over liabilities had fallen to £26,000,000, but in J 922 the assets were £101,000,000, and the liabilities £57,000,000, showing a surplus of assets over liabilities of £44,000,000. The liabilities for 1923 were as follows: Debts due to banks, £51,145,000; gold, £4,704,000 ; Government notes, £27,002,000 ; Government securities, £21,363,000; bank premises, £520,00.0; notes and bills of other banks, £1,110,000; total, £105,844,000. The liabilities amounted to £61,105,000. The surplus of assets over liabilities was, therefore, £44,000,000. We can see from these figures that the position is not so serious now as it has been, for it is better than it was in 1921, and as good as it was in 1922. When this proposal was first put forward it was strongly criticized by the Treasurer {Dr. Earle Page). Doubtless he obtained advice from the members of the Notes Issue Board, who furnished him with the reasons against it which he used when replying to the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> prior to his appointment to the Cabinet, in support of the proposal. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">There- is' no justification' for the* demands of the- private banking corporations, and1 the strongest argument any opposition could1 furnish- against the amendment comes from the mouth of the Treasurer' himself. In his recent budget speech-, in one statement after another- he showed clearly that there was no justification for the amendment. While the Treasurer pointed out" that the increase would: amount to £22,000,000 in. one" year; 1 shall show what the private banks' have done, of recent years. In 1916 they had' £58,000,000 in gold, and they issued* credit to the extent of no less than- £r96,000-,000'. Although their gold reserve has. now been reduced to about £50*000,000, yet- in one form or another the investments of the private, banks amount to,, roughly, -g300j06o,000. With the aid of. Commonwealth notes, which, are as good as gold,, the private banks have raised, a superstructure of credit of over £100,000,000 in a few years. But its. base is getting weaker day by day. They need to replenish it; and: they are going to- do it at the- expense of the nastion. This. Government proposes to advance to. the. banks additional notes. But a business man or any other, member, of- the community in. need&gt; of financial accommodation, no- matter how good his security may Be, may nob go. direct to- the Commonwealth. Bank,, but must mortgage his securities to trie private banking corporations, and pay the interest that they levy.. After that the private banks- will take the securities lodged by- members of the public,, deposit them with the. central bank,, and receive notes- in. exchange. In consideration! of.- those notes- the banks may, build up their credits, and- exploit, the. country.. Who&gt; is. now proposing to- load. Australia with additional7- taxation.?  Unfortunately,  the- revenue- that will come* from, the increased taxation; will. not. flow into* the- coffers of thee public; treasury/,. but.  into  the Commonwealth. Bank... The increased profits.  will  be for the- private corporations;, and! this-, will, constitute a.  further  levy upon' the productive, capacity.  of the country.. Yet the Government asks -why -production .is crippled., instead of studying 'lie interests of (the (private banks the Government should make money cheaper, and .make more currency ;available to all who have 'security to -offer. All should be given an opportunity to go to the national institution. Instead !of laying down the principle that what is good enough for the private individual -should be .sufficient security for the -nation itself., and .instead of providing cheap :currency for the small -producers, the Government, by .its proposal, will enable ;a :few bank shareholders to make 'enormous profits. Whatever liabilities or obligations the private institutions have, the&gt; .nation  must,  under the Government's proposal, -carry the responsibility. It as an outrageous proposition. It does not represent " government "o'f the people by the people for the people," but government rial the interests .of -the great capitalists -of Australia. '-Therefore, the Labour party is distinctly opposed to .the amendment. It is not wedded to the gold fetish. Time and again it has affirmed that Government notes issued on good security are as good .as gold itself. W-e say that the notes should be issued in the interest of -all sections. I ''hope that our attitude will be an intimation to the banking corporations -of this country that when the Labour party gets into power it will affirm what is .good credit -for the Commonwealth -Bank is also good credit for the -whole of the people. </para>

                    <para>.- I was rather interested, if not amused, by the -remarks -of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">-(Dr. Earle</inline> -Page) as to the 'reason -why the amendment is proposed. He told us that there 'was .some doubt  ais  to -whether '{he Notes Issue Board had -power to issue notes &gt;on securities in London,. 'and 'that the banking institutions 'themselves 'had intimated to him at 'some -private ..conference that, feeling their position rather insecure, they desired some definite action to be taken. A remarkable feature is that for the last sis months there has been .a .controversy in the daily press of Australia concerning the note  issue.  Not one of the authorities that has written from the point of view :of .the associated  banks  .has -contended that there .is any doubt -whatever as (to the Dower -of , tale board .to issue notes .against .London securities. .It was .contended that -the board had 'that '.power, -and -some of the .'articles even went ;so far as to .abuse it for mot issuing more :notes. .An .attempt was even made to intimidate it by the -threat of -a financial crisis. The Notes Issue Board resisted the intimidation by -the 'associated banks and their supporters, but now the intimidation -comes (direct 'from the .Government'. Its direction to the Notes Issue Board is that notes must -be issued against credit in 'London. I was rather surprised at the: interjection of --the Minister for Trade -and 'Customs when the 'honorable member for Yarra was speaking: -He said before obtaining Ministerial rank that 'the issue of -these notes against securities in London was calculated to reduce imports into this country. How -are these credits to :be finally transferred? Even  -SE  the Notes Issue Board issue notes against securities '-in London, those credits must be -transferred here at 'some future -Sane, and there is mo other means of doing this than by *£he importation -of goods. This is an innovation in 'banking business 'either in the interests of the private banking institutions or in 'those of the nation. Notes axe .to be issued against securities .outside Australia .over which this Government has no control. Not '.only is (the force of -the banking' institutions  it  toe used, but the whole legislative and administrative force of the Commonwealth Government is to be used to liquefy Australian frozen securities in London. If this would tin .some -way assist -national development, those -who are now advocating the step would toe loud in -their denunciation .of it. Some few weeks ago .1 was accused .in this chamber rand outside of wishing to issue notes against wheat find other commodities. That was not (correct. I stated -that <inline font-style="italic">M</inline> .notes 'were issued -against, say, wheat, -it -could be consumed, and the "notes would, still be .in circulation. Even if notes are issued against securities in London -and their »va'lue 5n imports is received from 'over-seas, there is no provision in -the hill for the cancellation df tha notes to 'the value of -the goods arriving. "The inflation of the currency will remain. Honorable members "have a vague idea of how these credits were .established. They have accrued -to the associated banks by their making -sums -of money available here to exporters of our products, and to some extent by discounting bills of exchange. The Minister for Trade and Customs, when a private member, told us that in one industry in which he was engaged he had to sacrifice £3 for every £100 worth of goods sold abroad. If that applied generally, the bankers, by giving credit here for £97, would receive a credit in London of £100. I wish to know whether the bankers are to get £100 notes for their £100 security in London, for which they paid £97 in Australia, thereby obtaining a " rake off " of at least £3 in every £100, in addition to what they otherwise get. Taking £3 for every £100 of the millions to be issued, honorable members will gain some idea of the first " rake off " that the associated banks will get at the expense of our primary producers. We are told that from £10,000,000 to £20,000,000 worth of notes may be issued. The banks will not only get £3 in every £100 clear profit by reason of the action of the Government, but the million of notes issued will inflate the currency. If the amount is £10,000,000, the banks will multiply credit by three, four, or five times that amount. If notes representing £30,000,000 are issued, the banks will get the benefit of 5 per cent.,  6 per cent., 7 per cent., or even 8 per cent, on £150,000,000. If the economic and industrial conditions of Australia make it necessary for us to have more currency, and the Australian nation can cope ' with another £10,000,000, £15,000,000, or £20,000,000 of currency, there is no need to go to England for it. The security is here, and the Government can get the benefit of a loan free of interest for the time being, if for national development and to prevent unemployment. There is another side to the question. We are to-day almost at an economic stand-still. Not 5 per cent, of this money which will be brought from England will go into anything but capitalistic production, thus making the economic burden harder to bear. That is where inflation and deflation come in. If £10,000,000 is spent in this country to assist in capitalistic production only, there will be inflation in two ways, and inflation of the worst possible kind. The financial institutions will get hold of the money and lend it out to people who will use it in connexion with big profit-making concerns. In every way its effect will be detrimental. It will hold up, instead of assisting, production. I rose to register my protest against this proposal, which is one of the worst put forward by the Government. We have had many boodling schemes introduced in the interests of the capitalists, who stand behind this Government, but this is the most daring of them all. Its effect on the nation will be greater than all the rest put together. This proposal can only be viewed with alarm, not only so far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, but in the interests of the nation. For that reason I am opposed to the proposition. </para>

If we issue notes against produce, we find that that produce is perishable. Notes should be issued against something which is tangible. Gold is the only standard of exchange recognized by the sane nations of the world. My amendment is moved in order to give effect to what I consider is the only sound and sane basis of currency on which any nation can exist, namely, gold. </para>

                    <para>.- At question time to-day the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> asked some questions, through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in connexion with a speech which I made at Ballarat last night. I think that it is only fair that I should have an opportunity to answer those questions. I did not mention, or refer to, the Labour party during my speech. The people to whom I referred were the disloyalists and the bolshevists. If the honorable member for Ballarat is prepared to accept the responsibility for saying that the Labour party comes within either of those classes, that is his concern, and not mine. If that is his opinion, it is certainly not mine. In view of the question he asked about my loyalty, and my war service, it is only fair that I should be allowed to state that although I am not able to wear the returned soldier's badge, I volunteered for service five times. I have certificates to prove that statement, and I also have a reject certificate and a reject badge. Those certificates and that badge relate to the last great war. I have no desire to boast, but I must answer the questions that have been asked. I did everything possible to provide comforts and necessaries for the troops and their dependants.I offered my home, which was suitable for the purpose, as a hospital for returned men, and I offered to equip it at my own expense. I also provided many workmen - carpenters and others - to make comforts, such as crutches and stretchers, for the men.. I paid for that out of my own pocket. I also contributed to all patriotic funds, and in many other directions did everything that it was possible for me to do to further the interests of members of the Australian Imperial Force. I provided motor cars and drivers to take men from hospitals for rides in the country. </para>

                    <para>- In reply to the last question of the honorable member for Ballarat, relating to the huge profits I am said to have made during the war, I can assure him, the House, and the country, that the war was to me a disadvantage from a business stand-point. I am making this statement because I regard it as most unfair for an honorable member to accuse me of not taking part in the war when I did my very best to do so. If any of the references I have made to disloyalty or bolshevism have anything to do with the honorable member for Ballarat, and if he desires to apply them to himself, that is no concern of mine. </para>
                </talk.start></continue><para>Mr.McGRATH (Ballarat)  [11.14]: -  I regret that the hour is late; otherwise there are a lot of things I could say in reply to the honorable member.  As  it is, I shall reply to him only briefly. He said he did not apply the terms " disloyalists," " bolshevists," or " anarchists " to members of the Labour party. He attended a gathering of anti -Labourites, who call themselves the Protestant Federation, and every utterance there was against the Labour party. The honorable member for Henty, in his speech to that gathering, complained of the want of unity between the two wings of the Government-the Nationalist party and the Country party. He said, " Why cannot we get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> to work unitedly? Supported by a united party, those two great men could effectually combat the forces of bolshevism and anarchy." If he was not referring to the Labour party, then I guarantee that his hearers of last night will be disappointed when they read his speech of to-night. There is no doubt that they honestly thought he was referring to the party that they expected him to denounce.  There  is no doubt that we were included in the denunciation, which came very ill from the honorable member. He may have volunteered to go to the war, but a number of others volunteered also, and took care that they did not pass. I do not know that he has any medals for the South African War, and he and others at that gathering had no right to say anything about the disloyalty of the Labour party in Ballarat. He could not have gone to a worse place to make such utterances. Out of seven seats in the State Parliament five are held by returned soldier Labour representatives, while I, another returned soldier, hold the Ballarat seat in this House. I resent his remarks, but as he  has  seen fit to make an apology, I accept it. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech>
