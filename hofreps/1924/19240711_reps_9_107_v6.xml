                        <para>- No. The Commonwealth Bank Act provides for the issue of an adequate amount of currency in Australia, and it is not, therefore, considered necessary to take the action suggested by the honorable member&#39;s question. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a very important clause, and I ask the committee to consider it carefully. I take it that on any money advanced by the Commonwealth towards the capital of the bank interest will be paid to the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- That proves the correctness of the contention of honorable members on this side, that this bill will hamstring the Commonwealth Bank. So far, the bank has got along very well without capital. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, good progress has been made. The original act provided for a capital of &#163;10,000.000, but advantage has not been taken of that provision. The bill originally provided for a capital of &#163;10,000,000 only, &#163;4,000,000 of which was to be taken from the bank&#39;s reserves, and &#163;6,000,000 was to be borrowed from the Treasury. Last night, however, without discussion, because of the application of the guillotine, the capital of the bank was increased from &#163;10,000,000 to &#163;20,000,000, with the result that the bank will be charged interest on &#163;16,000,000 of borrowed money. </para>

                        <para>- If it is not to be borrowed, why is this provision made? Why increase the amount by &#163;10,000,000 if it is not expected that the additional money will be required? No one will dispute that the bill now provides for a capital of &#163;20,000,000. Interest, at 5 per cent., on the &#163;16,000,000 which may be borrowed, represents a charge of &#163;800,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- A national bank, to occupy a strong financial position, should first discharge its liabilities in respect of borrowed moneys. Any balance of profit could then be devoted to the reduction of the national debt. Provision was made in the original act for the profits of the bank, or a portion of them, to be applied to the liquidation of the national debt. At that time, such a provision was desirable; but if the bank is to be loaded with an additional liability surely it is only fair that, after paying interest on the amount burrowed from the Treasury, any profits should go towards reducing the bank&#39;s own liability. Any sensible business man would conduct his business in that way. After the money borrowed for the purposes of the bank was repaid, half of the profits could go towards reducing the national debt. But no one will contend that we are contributing towards the success of the bank by hampering it in this way. I should be sorry for the men who had to administer the bank in such circumstances. If we desire to develop the Commonwealth Bank on purely national lines, and to make it a successful institution, we must proceed on sound principles, and give it an opportunity to make good. This clause does not provide that opportunity. I am only asking that the committee should consider the position carefully. I, therefore, move the following amendment : - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The proposed new section would then read - 30. (1) The net profits of the bank in each half-year shall be dealt with as follows: - {a) One-half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the Bank Reserve Fund; and <inline font-style="italic">\b)</inline> After the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded, one-half shall be paid into the National Debt </para>
                <para>Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet. (2) The Bank Reserve Fund shall be available for the payment of any liabilities of the bank. </para>
                <para class="block">That is a fair and reasonable amendment, which the Treasurer should accept. I bring it forward with no other purpose than to improve the bill. I desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall be the financial bulwark of Australia; but this clause places a great handicap on the bank - a handicap which I think should be removed. We have already decided in favour of the appointment of eight directors. Let us give them a fair chance to make a success of their undertaking. That cannot he done if provisions such as those contained in this clause are permitted to remain. It is idle for honorable members to say that this capital may not be required. If it is not required, so much the better ; but I am of the opinion that it will be necessary. If the bank applies to the Treasurer for &#163;10,000,000, that sum will be advanced, and the bank will have to pay 5 per cent., or more, interest on it. If it subsequently makes &#163;500,000 in profits, &#163;250,000 should go to the reserve fund, and the remaining &#163;250,000 should be applied to a reduction cf the debt to the Treasurer. If that course were adopted, the bank, in course of time, would clear off the debt. In its present form, the bill requires the bank to carry the &#34; poultice &#34; for all time. No doubt, the board of directors will be guided largely in their administration by the debate in this chamber. All I ask is that any money borrowed to provide the bank with capital shall be repaid before any payment into the national debt sinking fund is made. I hope that the Treasurer will accept my, amendment, and that honorable members generally will at least give it due consideration. If they do so, they must realize that it is necessary. </para>

                    <para>. - Before I deal with the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition in support of his amendment, I wish to indicate why the Government have had the bill amended in order to increase the capital of the bank from &#163;10,000,000 to &#163;20,000,000. The provision of &#163;10,000,000 was obviously a clerical error, as could be seen by any one who had read my speech, in which I  pointed out that the capital of the bank would ultimately be ?20,000,000, made up as follows:- ?4,000,000 by capitalizing the reserve fund of the bank, ?6,000,000 by borrowing from the Commonwealth, and ?10,000,000 by issuing debentures under an authority given by the original act, with which the present Government do not propose to interfere. </para>

                    <para>- The Government&#39;s amendment was simply to remedy  a  matter which had been overlooked in the drafting of the Bill, and to carry out the intention of the Government as indicated in the speech in which I explained the provisions of the measure. The Leader of the Opposition has submitted his amendment because a certain confusion of thought exists in regard to the position of the Commonwealth Bank. In the ultimate analysis the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are practically one and the same. The original capital of the bank was the credit of the Commonwealth, upon which the bank was built up. On that basis it has made profits which, it is using as capital. The Government&#39;s proposal is to- increase the beneficent work of the bank by increasing that capital. The ?6,000,000, which is to be raised by the Commonwealth and lent to the bank, will be practically in the same position as the preference capital raised by a private institution, and the bank will pay upon this preference capital, just as  a  private institution would, the effective rate of interest at which the money is borrowed. No one would suggest that as soon as profits are earned they should be employed to return preference capital to those who have provided it. This money will enable the Commonwealth Bank to extend its activities, and  spread  its influence. Tn the case of a private institution individual members of the public are asked to take up preference shares, but in  the case of  the Commonwealth Bank the same  people will  be asked to subscribe to  a  loan raised by the Commonwealth, and the money so raised will form capital for  the  Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party made provision in the original  act  for the raising of additional capital by the issue of debentures by the bank. We propose to provide  a  definite  preference  capital for the bank, thus enabling it, with its reserve, and without resort to the issue of debentures to have a capital of ?10,000,000, which will  be  more than that of any other Australian bank. It will thus be put in  a  dominant position, and be given considerable prestige. The money borrowed by the Commonwealth and lent to the bank will ultimately be repaid by means of  a  sinking fund in the same way as other Commonwealth loans. The bank will get  its  preference capital on the best possible terms on which the Commonwealth  can  borrow the money, and the amount will ultimately be repaid through the sinking fund. The Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to dissociate the Commonwealth and the bank, but they are  part  and parcel of the same big national entity, and cannot be dissociated.  In  the last analysis, the credit of the Commonwealth stands behind the bank,  and,,  in addition, the Government  are suggesting  a method by which the bank  can  be materially assisted.  I  cannot understand the suggestion to  pay back the  capital  of  the bank, seeing that it will be needed <inline font-style="italic">m.</inline> its operations.  The  bank will probably need more money. The honorable member has suggested that if the bank  borrows  ?16,000,000 it will have to pay ?800,000 in interest each year; but if it needs the money for the expansion of its business, that money will  earn  more than it will cost the bank in interest.  If  the bank cannot use the money  it borrows  to earn more than the rate of  interest  it is paying, it will have no  right  to borrow it. </para>

                        <para>- The money provided by the Commonwealth will be permanent capital for the Commonwealth Bank, and I have not heard of a firm malting any attempt to pay off its permanent capital. When the Commonwealth provides &#163;6,000,000 fresh capital for the bank, the profit-earning capacity of, the bank will be increased. If the bank pays half of its total profits into a reserve fund, its reserves will increase more rapidly than they would if that amount of capital were not made availably. It cannot be said that the Commonwealth Government have not acted most generously towards the Commonwealth Bank. Under the original act, the redemption fund of the bank could he utilized to liquidate the national debt; but when we brought down our National Debt Sinking Fund Bill last year, instead of taking steps to utilize the whole of the redemption fund of the Commonwealth Bank, amounting to over .&#163;2,000,000, we left that amount in the reserve fund of the bank, where it could he capitalized and made use of for the purposes of the bank. No one can suggest that the Government are doing anything to interfere with the activities of the bank. </para>

                        <para>-We are not taking away the profits earned by the bank. We are doing exactly what the Labour party originally suggested should be done, namely, dividing the profits of the bank into two parts, one to be paid into a sinking fund and the other to be paid into a redemption fund. We are now proposing to lend the bank more money in order to enable it to earn more profits, half of which will be paid into a reserve fund and the other half to a sinking fund. There is really, therefore, no alteration in the position. The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition can only be due to a confusion of ideas and to an attempt to discriminate between the Commonwealth Bank, as the property of the people, and other undertakings which are the property of the nation as a whole. We are suggesting the proper business-like way in which the matter should be dealt with. Therefore the Government cannot consider for a moment the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; it will be borrowed.  When  a man takes shares in a private company he takes the risk of the company paying dividends in the first few years; but in the case of the Commonwealth Bank the Government will borrow from the public - the associated banks, insurance companies, and other big vested interests who will provide the bulk of the money - and the bank will carry a permanent dead-weight of perhaps as high as 7 per cent, interest, which will have to be met every year whether (he bank makes a profit or not. It is confusing matters for the Treasurer to say that the position of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to this money will be the same as that of a limited liability company with subscribed capital. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank the money will be borrowed at a fixed rate of interest, whereas in the case of a limited liability company the money will be subscribed, as a commercial venture, by shareholders, who will take the risk of getting no dividends for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>- It is confusing to draw an analogy between the two concerns, or to claim that if the Commonwealth Bank is expected to pay back its borrowed money a limited liability company should also be expected to pay back its share&#39; capital. It is wrong to say that it is not good business for any concern to liquidate a debt borrowed at a high rate of interest, or that a national bank which borrows money at a high rate of interest should extort an undue rate of interest from its customers in order that it may earn 2 per cent, over and above the amount at which it has borrowed. To say that it is not good business for the bank to liquidate its own debt before applying its profits to the reduction of the national debt is to talk nonsense. Whoever makes such a statement does not know what good business is. The Treasurer says that it does not matter whether the bank liquidates its own debt or not, so long as it makes 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, profit on its borrowed money. But we should not place the bank in the position of having to demand an extortionate rate of interest from those who borrow from it, in order to ensure that it will be able to meet its own liabilities on its borrowed capital. Another aspect of the subject demands earnest attention. Under the provisions of the bill, the bank will be obliged to pay &#163;SOO,000 in&#39; interest every year, no matter whether the country is passing through, times of depression or not. Although the institution may only make a profit of &#163;200,000 in a particular year, it will still be compelled to pay &#163;S00,000 in interest, for all honorable members know that interest bills are the first that have to be met. One can see in this proposal the application to the Commonwealth Bank, with a view to hamstringing it, of those underhand methods and financial juggling tricks which mark the dealing of financial institutions the world over. It is nothing but an invitation to the financial institutions to destroy the usefulness of our bank. It is significant that the proposal to increase the capital of the bank was not submitted to honorable members until a few moments before the Prime Minister applied the &#34; gag &#34; to close the second-reading debate, and introduced the time-table which was to apply to the committee stage. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see much difference between saying that a man has told a deliberate untruth, and saying that he is a liar. The Treasurer was very indignant yesterday when a remark of this nature was made in respect to him; but I shall not ask that his observation be withdrawn, for I have no doubt that he will say later that many of my statements are deliberate untruths. To my knowledge, his amendment was not circulated among honorable members on this side of the chamber, until the Prime Minister introduced the&#34; &#34;gag.&#34; It may have been on the table, but, if it were, the attention of honorable members was not directed to it. It, and a number of other amendments, were submitted to the committee in one question by the  Chairman,  and, therefore, no consideration whatever was given to them. I do not blame the  Chairman  for submitting the matter as he did, for he acted in accordance with the Standing Orders ; but I say that honorable members have good reason to be suspicious of the motives which prompted the Treasurer to submit it as he did. This is .another way of saying to the committee, &#34; Here is a blank cheque. Please sign it. The Government wants this amendment to be made law, but the money which may be borrowed in accord with its provisions may not be needed.&#34; I am not prepared to accept statements like that, nor am I willing to sign blank cheques, particularly for this Government. It is ridiculous to suggest that the money may not be needed. Why is authority being sought to raise it if the Treasurer thinks that it will be necessary? I, for one, feel that I must assume that effect will be given to the proposal to borrow the whole of the &#163;16,000,000. The rate of interest to be paid for it may be 5 per cent, or may be 7 per cent. Let us assume for a moment, that the money will be obtained at 5 per cent., though I do not think that that is possible. The bank will then be obliged to charge 8, or even 9, per cent, to persons to whom it grants loans. I ask honorable members whether that is a fair position in which to place a national institution like the Commonwealth Bank? It may happen after this huge amount is borrowed, that the rate of interest will fall, even as low as 41 per cent., but the bank will not be able to repay the money it has borrowed. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition will, if adopted, place it in a much better position than is possible if the clause as drafted is agreed to. If the hank borrows the money in accordance with the provisions of the bill, and pays, say, 5 per cent, interest on it for twenty years, it will have paid &#163;16,000,000 in interest, but will still owe every penny of the principal. Does the Treasurer think that will be good business ? Of course, it will suit the <inline font-style="italic">if</inline> Lazzarini. <inline font-style="italic">&#39;tig</inline> financial institutions, but it will effectively cripple the bank. According to the Treasurer all will be right so long as the bank charges a sufficiently high rate of interest to its borrowers to enable it to make a profit. That practice is adopted by the associated banks and insurance companies, but it should not be countenanced in connexion with a national institution. I appeal to honorable members to support the amendment, for it offers the only opportunity they will have to protect the public interests in any degree. If we authorize the bank to repay, as early as possible, the money it borrows under this clause, we shall put it in a better position to assist later in liquidating the national debt. If, over a long period of years, it makes a small profit of 1 or 2 per cent, on its borrowed capital, it will not be able materially to reduce die national debt, but if we leave it free to liquidate its liabilities in this regard as soon as it can do so, it will probably be able, in a few years, to take effective steps to even wipe out the national debt. The Treasurer apparently desires that the bank shall be a good milch cow for the financial institutions, and, therefore, he proposes that we shall tie it up. It has been said that the Labour Government made provision in the original Commonwealth Bank Bill for the bank to borrow &#163;6,000,000. That is so, but the money was never borrowed. The proposal made by the Labour Government was absolutely different in principle from that now before us. The Labour party&#39;s ideal was: &#34; The bank the nation, and the nation the bank.&#34; The Treasurer says now that we wish to dissociate the bank from the nation. That is a ridiculous contention, as everybody who knows the Labour party&#39;s ideals in relation to the bank must realize. It is the Government that wishes to dissociate the bank from the nation, by compelling it to enter into closer relations with the associated banks, and so bolster up the present system. Not even the worst class of private financial institutions would suggest that borrowed money should be used as permanent capital, yet that is what the Government is proposing. How can borrowed money be termed permanent capital? The thing is impossible. The very fact of borrowing money postulates that it has to be repaid, and security given for it. The only way in which this &#163;6,000,000&#34; or &#163;16,000,000 of borrowed money can become permanent capital is by repayment out of the future profits of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Treasurer says that the Commonwealth Bank cannot be dissociated from the people, yet he refuses to dissociate it from the big interests. It is obvious that the large financial institutions and interests will contribute to the loan. If the Treasurer said, &#34;Let the people of the Commonwealth raise &#163;6,000,000 by subscribing &#163;1 each.&#34; that would be a different proposition, and the permanent capital of the bank would then be contributed by the whole of the people. To provide &#163;6,000,000 or &#163;16,000,000 at, say, 5 per cent., and to term it permanent capital is the height of absurdity, and I cannot understand the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> making such a statement. </para>

                    <para>.- When listening to the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> I felt the most awful sensations, worse than nightmare following an unwholesome meal. He talked of nothing but capital, capital,  capital.  His  remarks are insulting to the acting governor, and to every other officer of the Commonwealth Bank. It is no wonder that almost every industry and business undertaken by the Government results in failure. We see evidences of this day in and day out. It is the foolish criticism and political &#34; guff &#34; used by the Opposition that prevents any business man from taking an interest in this country. How can the Commonwealth progress under such circumstances? The members of the Opposition have no real desire to perfect this bill. Their one objective is to take up, with irrelevant discussion, the whole of the time of the committee, to ensure that nothing shall be done. This is not the way in which legislation should be framed by this Parliament. They should realize their responsibilities, and not decry what is being done by the Government. It is dirty tactics, pure political strategy and intrigue, that is at the bottom of all this talk. The Opposition try to discourage the Government supporters in every possible way. The Government are blamed for everything. According to honorable members opposite, every director appointed to the board will be dishonorable, and, in fact, every individual in the Commonwealth is dishonorable. It is a shameful attitude. We should consider this measure in a business-like manner. The capital of &#163;16,000,000 is to be subscribed to increase the business of the Commonwealth Bank. That amount will not be. subscribed by any private bank or individual unless it is thought good business to subscribe it. Money cannot be obtained at less than 5 per cent, interest, and the management of the bank will, therefore, be unable to make loans at less than 6&#163; or 7 per cent. The same rule will apply to the bank as applies to an individual who borrows money from a bank for, say, two years, at a certain rate of interest. The money must be invested judiciously and no bad debts incurred. The bank must have good security, equal at least to a margin of 40 per cent. When opportunity offered, and the directors desired to reduce the capital of the bank, the Commonwealth Government would be pleased and willing to take back portion of the borrowed money. </para>

How can the Commonwealth Bank, with a capital of only &#163;4,500,000, be expected to carry on the business of the Commonwealth ? Honorable members opposite say, &#34; We shall make the bank the people&#39;s bank, and the only bank in Australia; we will buy out with &#163;4,500,000 of capital the Bank of New South WaJ.es, with &#163;10,000,000.&#34; I have never listened to such utter rot. One honorable member said that the Commonwealth Bank should buy up all the associated banks of Australia. </para>

The Opposition claim the right -to take the assets of the associated banks and run the Commonwealth Bank with the brains of Parliament. Not one of us knows much about banking. I know very little about it myself, and I should be very sorry if this Parliament, or any party - Labour, Country, or National - attempted to finance Australia. It is not within our province. It is our duty, as representatives of the people, to raise sufficient money by way of taxation to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. Every individual should follow his own avocation. It is disastrous for any one to interfere with something about which he knows nothing. For any honorable member to contend that we have the whole of the brains of Australia in this House is absurd. </para>

Australia will never be developed while it is hamstrung by political interference. We are preparing this country, not for Australians, but for other nations. It is time that we realized the position financially. We should use our best endeavours to make this bill perfect, to enable the Commonwealth Bank to deal effectively with the question of exchange, thus keeping men in employment, instead of closing up industries and driving men off the land. We should try to prevent this country from deteriorating to a state of stagnation and decay. The Opposition wish to establish an impossible state of things in which everything shall work like an automaton. Instead of dealing with this measure in an incapable manner, showing our ignorance, and becoming the laughing stock of the whole world, we should work on practical lines to assist every individual of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not follow the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitsitt)</inline> in his accusation against the Labour party of dirty political intrigue and strategy. Probably he is the best judge of such things, and I shall leave him to his own thoughts on that subject. This is the first time that I have risen to speak on the bill. I wish to pla.ce on record my feeling of sorrow that the Government has seen fit to allot the time for the consideration of the measure at the committee stage. My sorrow is the greater when I notice on the other side of the chamber the listlessness of honorable members, and the general chattering that is taking place during the discussion, proving that members there have no further interest in the bill, having decided at all costs to support the Government. The Treasurer&#39;s statement, supported by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> that the Government has brought down similar proposals to those that were originally introduced by the Labour party, is incorrect. I shall compare the proposals that were brought before the country by the Labour party with those that the Treasurer now intends to insert in the bill, so that readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may he able to form their own opinions. The section that was inserted by the Labour party, and which it is now proposed by the Government to strike out, reads -  30. (1.) The net profits derived by the Bank shall be dealt with as follows: - (a.) one half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the Bank. Reserve Fund, and (6) the other half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the Redemption Fund. (2.) The Bank Reserve Fund shall be available for the payment of any liabilities of the Bank. (3.) The Redemption Fund may be used in repayment of any money advanced to the Bank by the Treasurer, or in the redemption of the debentures or stock issued by the Bank, but if the Fund exceeds the amount of debentures and stock in circulation the excess may be used for the purposes of the redemption of any Commonwealth debts or State debts taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition this morning is distinctly in line with that section. The amendment proposed by the Government reads -  30.- (1.) The net profits of the Bank in each half-year shall be dealt with as follows: - (a.) One-half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the Bank Reserve Fund; and (b) One-half shall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet. (2.) The Bank Reserve Fund shall he available for the payment of any liabilities of the Bank.  </para>
                <para class="block">The first difference is that, in the Government proposals&#39; - the clause now before the committee - it is distinctly laid down that half the profits shall be paid into a fund to he called the bank reserve fund, and the other half of the profits paid into the national debt sinking fund. There is no option whatever to be exercised in that matter. But in the provisions inserted by the Labour party, it was laid down that half the profits should he placed to the credit of the hank reserve fund, and the other half to the credit of the redemption fund - not the national debt redemption fluid. I want that distinction to he noted. The Labour party&#39;s provisions set out that capital borrowed by the bank from the Treasurer could be repaid out of that bank redemption fund. But the Treasurer will admit that, in his proposals, he is deliberately cutting out the original.  provisions of the Labour party. What is the object of doing that? </para>

                        <para>- What has been done has been done, but it is evidently the intention to issue debentures in the future. The bank will become indebted to the people that advance the capital, and its .indebtedness will continue perpetually. That is where the Labour party and I join issue with the Treasurer, for his proposals perpetuate a system whereby the bank will pay its profits into the pockets of private capitalists. The Treasurer may argue otherwise, but the fact remains. All we ask is that the profits made by the bank shall be used to pay back money that lias been borrowed. The Treasurer said in his speech, &#34;But the bank will want its capital.&#34; He was trying to suggest that- if the bank made profits that were used to pay back borrowed money, the effect would be to lessen its capital. Nothing of the kind would happen. The capital of the bank would remain, and the only difference would be that the bank would not have to pay interest on it. It is ridiculous for the Treasurer to say that if the bank used its profits to pay back borrowed money, its capital would be decreased. As a matter of fact, to use its profits in such a way would place the bank in a much stronger position. I resent the Treasurer&#39;s suggestion, that the Government&#39;s proposals are in line with the original proposals of the Labour party. The Labour party&#39;s proposals were framed with a view to making the bank a national bank, and to remove it from the power of private financiers. The Government&#39;s proposal will do the reverse, and yet wonder has been expressed that honorable members on this side have doubts of what is in the minds of members of the Government. We cannot think other than we do when we consider the provisions made by the Labour party, and the amendments of them proposed by the Government. I want, for a moment, to cast aside all party feelings. I regret that on such an important bill the Government should restrict discussion in committee. It could more reasonably have restricted the debate upon the second reading. Members&#39; second-reading speeches might have been cut down from an hour and 5 minutes to 30 minutes each. There was a lot of repetition in those speeches, and they were tiresome to listen to. It is not fair or reasonable, to u3 or to our constituents, to limit the discussion in committee. </para>

                    <para>.- I want honorable members to cast their minds back to the original proposals made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> The bill says that certain profits of the bank shall be devoted to the liquidation of the national debt. The Leader of the Opposition tackled the very difficult job of convincing the committee of the unwisdom of that proposal, and he did it in spite of contemptible remarks and indifference on the part of honorable members. Members of the committee ought to take more interest . in the bill. Few things affect the interests of the people more than does finance, in which this bill plays an important part. The Treasurer told us something this morning about which honorable members opposite know very little. I asked the Treasurer whether the question had been discussed in caucus, and he replied, &#34; No.&#34; I forgot for the moment that there were two parties in the Government, one of which meets upstairs, and holds a caucus on all Government matters, and the other downstairs. This question was evidently brought before the party that meets upstairs. The Government is going to raise &#163;20,000,000, and my leader suggested that instead of the bank using its profits to pay off the national debt, they should be employed to reduce the debt of the bank. If so employed they would not reduce the capital of the bank. If the bank had a borrowed capital of &#163;20,000,000, and made a profit in one year of &#163;1,000,000, it would be in a position to reduce its debt to &#163;19,000,000. In the next year it would save, by that action, &#163;50,000 in interest, and its second year&#39;s profit would be increased by that amount. Eventually there would - be no debt on the bank, and it would have a capital reserve of &#163;20,000,000 without interest to work on. When honorable members on this side put that proposal before the Government, the Treasurer, in reply, tries to distort the issue. I am quite satisfied that even the Treasurer is not pleased with the bill. He finds it necessary to consult With his departmental officers repeatedly. Knowing something of the procedure of Parliament, I am quite satisfied that the Government did not know the true position until it was brought under the notice of the Treasurer by members of the Opposition. T hope honorable members will deal more seriously with the question. I feel very serious, and very disappointed, because I can see the stupidity of the Government&#39;s proposal to kill the bill. Honorable members sitting behind the Government will soon be condemned tor the action they are now taking. Whoever has advised the Government has not a true conception of what a national bank should be. Honorable members on this side are wedded to a policy that the electors endorsed by a very substantial majority of votes in 1910. The people then declared that a national bank should be established. The proposal to wipe out the public debt before removing the debt on the bank is not treating the bank properly. A company that has debentures maturing in ten years sets aside a certain sum of money each year to provide for the redemption of those debentures. If the bank was a private concern its profits would be used to pay dividends to its- shareholders, but as it is a national bank, every individual in the community is a shareholder. Instead of dividing the money among the people in the community, we advocate that it should be set aside for the purposes of redeeming the debt on the bank. If honorable members would give the question a little consideration, instead of treating it with indifference, they would agree with the Leader of the Opposition. I doubt if a majority of honorable members will support the proposal of the Government, but, even if they do, I believe that in another place a broad view of the matter will be taken, and the interests of the people conserved. One can only gather the impression that behind the bill is an ulterior motive that has not been made known to honorable members. I have an idea that it is desired that in the busy season, about September, when shearing takes place and the private banks have to meet a big drain on their liquid assets, they may be able to call upon the Commonwealth Bank to help them until such time as they can get their export returns from Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- But the bill does not provide for that; it is designed to do something else, and makes the bank&#39;s customers pay very high interest. If the honorable gentleman had given the bill full consideration he would be unable to agree with its provisions. If he does approve of the measure, then, considering the speeches he has made in this chamber on financial subjects, he takes a stand that is remarkably reminiscent of the &#34;Yes-No&#34; attitude of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid on certain important public questions. I am satisfied that Ministers do not have much time in Cabinet to go into the details of the measures to be brought down, and it seems to me that they have not fully considered the effect of this bill. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> will be in a strange position when the people learn the exact nature of the present bill and also refresh their memories regarding the Minister&#39;s financial orations. Of course, I realize that he will be able to justify his position to some extent, in that the bill was introduced before he took office. Instead of efforts being made in this chamber to establish a truly national bank, the measure is being manipulated in such a way that the Commonwealth Bank cannot possess that characteristic. I hope that steps will be taken in the next Parliament 1o place the bank on the basis originally intended. In 1910, a substantial majority of the electors endorsed the Labour party&#39;s policy, and every alteration of the original act involving a serious change in the functions of the bank means a breach of faith with the people. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment before the committee is not unexpected, since the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> forecast it in his second-reading speech. I have listened with interest to the debate, and particularly to the remarks of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West).</inline> One aspect of the discussion is rather amusing to those who realize to what an absolute farce the proceedings of this Chamber can, without committing a breach of the Standing Orders, be brought. In speaking to people who have not the privilege of knowing how debates can be carried on in parliament, I have said that if all honorable members fully exercised their privileges under the Standing Orders, no business whatever would be transacted. Honorable members are now considering the third amendment that has been moved. The Leader of the Opposition, and those of his supporters who followed him, contended that the Government have not allowed sufficient time to discuss the measure, although when the Leader of the Opposition first spoke, he said that the bill could, without fail, be put through before the closing time this afternoon without the necessity for the application of the closure. The guillotine has been applied strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, and yet the Opposition has discussed the bill in such a way as to deprive the debate of interest to honorable members. First there was an amendment proposed in the definition clause, and the first two hours were occupied in discussing that clause. </para>

                        <para>- It is advisable that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should show how members of the Opposition have deliberately blocked progress. I, for one, strongly protest against the way in which honorable members opposite, although strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, are blocking discussion on a very important measure. As the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> said a few moments ago, when the bill reaches another place proper consideration will no doubt be given to the amendments - an ample justification of the bi-cameral (system of government. What greater argument could be adduced in opposition to a single-chamber parliament - which I understand is advocated by honorable members opposite - when we find a few honorable members taking advantage of their privileges to mock one of the most important bills we shall have before us this session ? If honorable members opposite were seized of their responsibilities, they would give every assistance to the Government to have the measure fully discussed with a view to improving it. The first two amendments submitted, however, were identical. When the Leader of the Opposition &#39;moved on the definition clause an amendment that the directorate be altered, and when he failed, as he was obviously destined to do, instead of accepting his defeat, he went on to the next clause, which dealt with the same subject, and moved a. similar amendment. The result was that the time of the committee was occupied in debating over again the question which had already been decided by a considerable majority. The Leader of the Opposition remarked that he did not wish to go over the same ground again, yet he deliberately did so. One member after another made what were, in effect, second-reading speeches. </para>

                        <para>- Unlike some honorable members opposite, when I do that the people will be able to understand what I say. The extraordinary statement has been made that if the Government advance &#163;6,000,000, or any sum, to the Commonwealth Bank, the money will not be capital. I do not know what it can he called if it cannot be properly designated as capital. We have also been told that it would be a liability on the bank. Is not the capital that the shareholders have advanced a liability on a bank? Personally, I am very glad to know that half the profits are to be earmarked for the very laudable purpose of the redemption of the national debt.. If there is anything that  this  party prides itself upon at present, it is the reduction already made in the national debt. Any steps taken in that direction will receive my hearty support. </para>

                        <para>- In all its history the Labour party has never reduced the public debt. Its sole achievement has been the squandering of public money. When they are in opposition they protest loudly against a policy of borrowing, but whenever they get into power they lose no time in increasing the public debt and in squandering public funds. The people know this. It is one reason why honorable members opposite have had such a long experience of the cold shades of opposition. Their whole stock-in-trade now is, &#34; You wait until after the next general election. We shall be in power then.&#34; I was not in this Parliament prior to the last election, but I remember reading, time after time, the same predictions in the debates of former Parliaments, and I have no doubt whatever that after the next general election those who survive the election will be saying the same thing and from the same places in this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the man who beats me will have to put up a pretty good fight. I regret that, as the result of action taken by honorable members opposite, the time available for the discussion of the various clauses in this bill is so limited. On the admission of their own leader, the Government have allowed ample time for debate. Possibly it was an unfortunate remark for the Leader of the Opposition to make, but the statement nevertheless is on record that he admitted that the time which the Government proposed to allow for the debate on this bill was ample. And then he deliberately set out to prevent discussion. The guillotine is nothing new. It has been in operation in the British Parliament for a great many years, and experience has shown that if the time allowed be used properly ample opportunity is given to members on both sides to discuss measures in a reasonable way. But when the occasion is abused, as it has been in connexion with this measure, the guillotine becomes the best instrument I know of to enable the Government to get its bills through without amendment. Were I a member of a Cabinet and anxious to get measures through without amendment, I know of no better method, provided, of course, the Opposition adopted an attitude of obstruction, of getting bills passed without amendment than by means of the guillotine motion. Honorable members opposite swallow the bait like a cod swallows a frog. They immediately set out to debate some futile amendment and lose sight of their opportunity to concentrate on the more important provisions of the bill. The guillotine process was never intended to work in that way. If the time allotted for the consideration of the various clauses of the bill is utilized wisely, there is opportunity, for fair debate and a proper consideration of legislation going through. </para>

                        <para>- By speaking in general terms, I am following the example set by the honorable member last night when he entertained the committee with his views. I am about tired of sitting here listening to honorable members of the Opposition without saying something in reply. The clause should be accepted by the committee. The honorable . member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> explained the position fairly well. It must be obvious to any one that what he said with regard to the capital of the bank was correct. If the profits are used to repay borrowed capital the capital of the bank is not thereby reduced. </para>

The amendment provides for the constitution of a board of appeal to deal with classifications, transfers, and dismissals which might occur from time to time, and if adopted will give some measure of security to the employees of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment must commend itself to the committee. At present there is no provision whereby officers of the Commonwealth Bank may secure redress against any form of tyranny to which they may be subjected by the management of the bank. Commonwealth public servants work under a board of appeal or a board of inquiry, and the amendment seeks to place officers of the Commonwealth Bank on a similar footing. There are many ways in which a despotic management may impose all sorts of unfair conditions upon officers of the bank; among others, transferring them to isolated places, depriving them of their classification rights, and withholding from them emoluments which rightfully attach to the positions they occupy. The amendment provides complete machinery for dealing with such eases. I have been informed that strong prejudice has in the past been exhibited by the management of the bank against officers who have identified themselves with any association or union. The best interests of the institution are not thereby promoted, nor are the staff made satisfied and contented. As the right of appeal is allowed to officers in the various divisions in the Public Service, it is only fair to give the officers of the bank the same right, so that they may feel that a full measure of redress is secured to them by a tribunal free from prejudice and bias, which will give judgment upon the merits of their cases. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Government appreciates the position in which the bank&#39;s officers are placed, and recognizes that there is a necessity to provide some means for insuring that the men shall have an absolutely fair run. But I venture to suggest that the machinery proposed by the honorable member is so cumbersome that it would practically hamstring the board in its management of the bank&#39;s affairs. The Government offers an alternative amendment. At present, I understand, the difficulty is that officers of the bank are very often unable to reach the governor of the bank. The amendment which <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government proposes provides that where an officer of the bank is affected in his employment by the action of any authority of the bank other than the board, he may, within the prescribed time, submit in writing an appeal to the board, stating fully the action appealed against, and the grounds of the appeal. It is provided, further, that the board shall consider and determine any such appeal, and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive. That will provide an easy passage between the employees and the board of directors. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> apparently overlooked the fact that he was addressing a body of men who know something about the Public Service and the manner in which it is controlled. No branch of the Public Service would tolerate for five minutes an appeal board consisting only of the employers. An appeal should be heard by an independent body. The proposal of the Treasurer would mean an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. The matter can be simply handled by bringing the officers of the bank under the control of the Public Service Board, giving them the same status as public servants, the same rights and privileges, and the same tenure of office. The position of the officers of the bank to-day is intolerable. They can be dismissed at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The only change proposed is that from one-man control to control by a board. There is not the slightest change in principle. The principle underlying the constitution of a board of appeal is that it shall be independent and impartial and have represented on it the employees concerned. It is astonishing that the Go.vernment should insult the intelligence of honorable members by circulating the amendment referred to by the Treasurer. Were it not for the operation of the guillotine, and the fact that there are other amendments to be considered, we would be justified in holding up the clause until the Government changed its mind. These officers in the past have been tyrannically treated. Proved cases of victimization, because men have dared to join a union, can be placed before Parliament if the Government will give us an opportunity to do so. The right of access to the Arbitration Courts is not a protection to these men, even though they are registered in the court, because the management of the bank has been so subtle in its methods that it has taken fine care not to openly dismiss men because they have taken an active part in the affairs of the union. Men have been dismissed for  fictitious  reasons and have not been able to bring their cases personally to the notice of the governor of the bank. A tyrant visiting Melbourne has been able to impose his sweet will upon the men, and whenever one has come between the wind and him out he has gone, although he may have rendered good service for many years. If the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> wants the bank to be a success - which I seriously doubt, in view of the actions of the Government - the only way to achieve that object is to have a contented staff which will work in unison with the management and take a personal interest in the advancement of the bank. That is not the case at present. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot help thinking that the Treasurer was ironical in the suggestion he made regarding the vexed question of control and the relationship of employer  and  employee. The Public Service Arbitration Act provides a tribunal for dealing with public servants, and that tribunal was created as the result of long-sustained agitation by the Labour party. It does not operate with entire satisfaction to the persons most concerned, but on the whole it represents a step in the right direction. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank are excluded from the operations of that tribunal, and whilst technically they are not excluded from the benefits of the general policy of conciliation and arbitration, they are really excluded by the attitude of hostility, at one time veiled, and more recently open, on the part of the management of the bank. Having regard to the favorable  attitude  of Parliament towards arbitration, this bill represents a deplorably retrogressive step, for it gives no protection whatever to the employees of the bank as regards recourse to the Arbitration Court or an independent board of appeal. The Government have made use of means ready to their hands for preventing the expression of public indignation in this regard, but they have not ready means of preventing the growth of serious discontent in the service of the bank; and that feeling is finding expression. The present acting governor of the bank at one time gave a sort of halfhearted permission to the employees to form an organization for registration under the Arbitration Act, in order to get the benefit of an award; but when members of the staff went so far as to assure the staff generally that the acting governor was sympathetic with such organization, that gentleman issued a manifesto in which he declared his hostility to arbitration in terms that were scarcely veiled, and hinted that he would prefer an organization of the employees on the old familiar lines - a boss&#39;s organization. We have progressed much beyond that,, and if the Government desires to have a contented staff in the bank, it will have to give the officers the arbitration facilities that are available to members of the Public Service generally, and to workers in every avocation. The Commonwealth Bank service must not continue to be the &#34; Cinderella &#34; of the industrial world. The amendment of which the Treasurer has given notice gives point to much of the criticism that has been uttered in regard to the management of the bank. Without attempting to threaten the Government, I assure Ministers that if they do not provide machinery such as is suggested by tie honorable member forHindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> or some other means by which the employees may organize and get the results of organization in an ordinary lawful way, organization will proceed on lines which will not be conducive to the success of the bank. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> on having made a close study of the Country party&#39;s platform, and on having taken from that platform the new clause which he has just moved. I point out to the honorable member, however, that if he studies that platform a little more closely he will notice that it suggests that the rural credit system shall be established as an integral part of the savings bank department of the bank to carry out the various functions which his motion suggests. This hill has been introduced with the definite object of making the Commonwealth Bank a central bank; all other issues have been carefully excluded. Possibly the Commonwealth Bank Act could, with advantage, be amended in other directions, but the Government has tried to keep the issue clear and free from confusion. The powers which the bill will vest in the board of control are wide enough to accomplish what the honorable member desires.  His  amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. It would be unwise at this juncture to inaugurate a system of this kind without at the same time providing the requisite machinery to carry it into effect. In connexion with a system of rural credits, we must not lose sight of the essential fact that advances in these cases are required for fairly long terms. Australia requires a system whereby the producer can receive payment for his produce as soon as it is delivered at the store, even though it is not sold for eight or ten months afterwards. A central bank needs resources of a very liquid nature, able to be mobilized quickly. The Government in this bill has endeavoured to provide resources for the central bank which will be essentially liquid-resources capable of being availed of in the shortest time possible. That is the reason for the capital of the bank being increased from a reserve of about &#163;4,500,000 to &#163;20,000,000 in all; firstly, by means of a loan to the bank ; secondly, by retaining unimpaired its debenture power, and thirdly, additional liquid sources are provided by giving the board the power to control the note issue. I shall not labour the point, but desire to inform honorable members that the Government has the whole question of the financing of our rural industries under consideration. When the plan has been thoroughly worked out, the House will be informed of the policy the Government proposes to pursue regarding the marketing of our primary products, and the provision of machinery to enable the bank to function with the greatest satisfaction to all concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- A very respected and expert financier, named John Law, once propounded a scheme for the issue of notes on the lands in the Mississippi Valley, and for 200 years his scheme has been held up as one of the greatest wild-cat financial propositions ever put forward. I take this opportunity of drawing attention to the fact that after the second reading of the bill had been passed, and the gag had been applied in committee, the Government introduced the following entirely new provision :  - </para>

                <para class="block">This proposal, not having been put forward at the second-reading stage, could not then be discussed, and, by the application of the gag, no opportunity was afforded to discuss it in committee. Even now I have no desire to comment upon it beyond saying that the Government are laying down a new basis for our currency. It will no longer be based on gold or securities within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, but will be based, to a large extent, on securities outside the Commonwealth, and liable to destruction or depreciation from causes over which the Commonwealth Government will have no control. It is quite possible that the Government are now paving the way to a serious position which may eventuate in the near future. However, my main object in rising now is to call attention to the fact that at Traralgon, on the 15th August, 1922, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> said that &#34; it was important that a rural credit branch of the Commonwealth Bank should be established, in order to foster rural production &#34; ; and that on the 27th </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has a certain amount of doggedness in his nature, because he has. hung on to this particular proposition for, I think, three days. To him, apparently, a matter of such urgent importance to the whole community, as is this bill, the object of which is to provide efficient machinery to handle exchange problems, is a tremendous jest, or something that can be bandied about. The honorable member has received the assurance of the Government that the establishment of a rural credits bank is receiving consideration. He has been told that it is in the platform of the Country party. In the speeches he has quoted I distinctly stated that it was to be dealt with in connexion with the savings bank, and not the general business of the Commonwealth Bank, and the reasons for not providing for it in this bill were fully explained to him. In his second-reading speech he dismissed, with an airy wave of the hand, the whole question of overseas exchange, notwithstanding that I considered it sufficiently important to devote a considerable part of my speech to it. The exchange question is of vital interest to the producing interests of Australia, and the Government believes that the establishment of a central bank will help to relieve the difficulties which now exist. It is- specially important that an immediate attempt should be made to improve the position, for our producers will soon be attempting to dispose of their wool clip and wheat harvest. The sale of these products must be financed. That is one of the main reasons why the Government wishes the bill to be passed quickly. The honorable member for Bourke and his colleagues are not very much concerned- </para>

However, I ask the Treasurer to confine himself to the question of the recommittal of the bill on the grounds stated in the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I have made it abundantly clear, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the Opposition does not desire a discussion on the important matter of our exchange difficulties. This bill has been before the House for almost a month, yet the honorable member for Bourke took four weeks to incubate and submit his amendment on rural credits. It appears that the Opposition has suddenly had a wonderful inspiration, and thinks that here is a chance to prevent the Government from rendering rapid and reason a&#39;ble assistance to the producers. Honorable members opposite know very well that one of the functions pf the Commonwealth Bank is to stand behind the primary producers and stimulate the  development of the country. It is rather surprising to find that although a Labour Government has been in power for nine years in Queensland, it has made no effort to introduce legislation of the kind desired by the honorable member for Bourke, For seven years, that Government gave no consideration whatever to the men on the land, but when it found that its hold on the country was slipping, it introduced some specious legislation to try to regain its lost ground. I do not think that the motives of the Opposition in supporting this amendment of the honorable member for Bourke will he any more misunderstood by the general public than were their motives in failing to support the Government&#39;s recent effort to obtain Imperial preference. Had we succeeded in securing Imperial preference, the prospects of profitably marketing our produce would have been increased enormously </para>

                        <para>-The New South Wales Government, which was drawn from the Nationalist and Progressive parties, has already provided for a system of rural credits, but it was bitterly opposed by the Labour party. This Government considers that the establishment of a central Hank will assist that scheme. Legislation has also been passed by other countries to provide for rural credits, but the honorable member for Bourke should have some regard to the proper procedure. The United States of America first established a central bank and a federal reserve system; then farm loan banks and associations were formed, and later, rural credits societies were established. A central banking system was necessary before an effective system of rural credits could be established. The procedure of the United States of America is the one that we shall have to adopt. If the honorable member for Bourke were permitted to put the cart before the horse, a successful system could not be inaugurated. A proper method of rural credits can only be constructed on the solid rock of experience. It cannot be built on the shifting sands of expediency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley desired to establish a bank of issue, rediscount, exchange, and reserve. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so pessimistic as the honorable member. The honorable member&#39;s amendment may have a result quite unexpected by him, since it may hasten the day when we shall be able to bring down to this House a concrete proposal for a system of rural credits. There is an essential difference between a central banking system and a system providing for loans to farmers, rural credits, &#38;c. In the case of the central banking system, the assets and the resources . of the bank must be available at short notice. At a time of temporary stringency we must be able to mobilize those resources in the quickest possible time, and wherever there is a weak spot in the system, to concentrate our efforts on it to try to prevent a disaster. On the other hand, the outstanding feature of the rural credits system is that the terms of credit must be long. Farm mortgages should operate for ten years, or even longer, to enable a farmer to have a reasonable prospect of considerably reducing his mortgage by the time it falls due. A reasonable rate of interest should be charged, and provision made to enable the produce of the farmers and pastoralists to be marketed in such a way as to prevent these people from being forced to sell immediately, at a sacrifice, owing to shortage of money. They should be able to obtain a fair price for their produce at the time it is fit for market. At present our producers have frequently to sell at a sacrifice because they are in need of ready cash. The institution administering a system of rural credits must be able to make advances over long terms. When the proper machinery has been created, we shall be able to bring into being a satisfactory, well considered, well based, and progressive system, that will enable the producers of this country to come into their own. </para>

                <para>I am pleased to inform honorable members that the regulations relating to broadcasting will probably be issued in the course of the next few days, and that I am now able to outline their provisions. Honorable members know that in an attempt to- define the basis upon which broadcasting should be permitted, a conference of all interests concerned was held in Sydney. It was decided that operations should be conducted by means of sealed sets, and that individual wave lengths should be apportioned. That system was tried, but, unfortunately, experience proved beyond question that the basis recommended by the conference, and adopted by the Government, would not lead to a rapid expansion of broadcasting. Consequently, further conferences were held, and the recommendations made by them have been under the consideration of the Government for some time. Very great difficulty has been experienced in evolving a system that, while it would promote broadcasting to the fullest possible extent, would be equitable to all the interests concerned. The regulations shortly to be issued will provide for the continuing of existing licences to broadcasters, but sealed sets will be entirely abolished, and open sets substituted. Every one will be able to receive broadcasted programmes provided he or she has a receiving set and has paid the required licence-fee for the service. There will be two types- of broadcasting licences. One will be for class &#34;A&#34; stations, which will obtain revenue from licence-fees, and the other for class &#34; B &#34; stations, which will not receive any revenue from that source. Both types of stations will be allowed to broadcast advertisements, but class &#34;A&#34; stations will be permitted to broadcast advertisements only for limited periods. The stipulation will be that advertising matter must not exceed five minutes at a time, and must not aggregate more than 30 minutes in a regular programme, or 60 minutes in twelve consecutive hours. Advertisements must be preceded by a suitable announcement, so that any one listening-in will be warned that for the next five minutes at the most advertisements will be broadcasted. Those who do not wish to listen to the advertisements will thus not be compelled to do so. The minimum powers on which the stations shall operate are stipulated. Existing licensees will- be permitted to operate &#34;A&#34; class stations, and in Queensland and Tasmania, where no licences have yet been issued for broadcasting, one . &#34; A &#34; class station will be .authorized in each case. The two existing licensees in each of the state3 of New South Wales and Victoria will receive 70 per cent, and 30 per cent, respectively of the fees available for distribution in those states. One of the stations will operate on a power of not less than 5,000 watts, and the other on not less than 1,500 watts. The higher percentage of fees will be allotted to the station operating on the higher power. If the apportionment of the fees in the ratio of 70 to 30 per cent, is objected to by the broadcasters, they can go to arbitration to determine what the proportions should be. The total amount to be apportioned between the two will, of course, be the amount provided out of the licensing fees for distribution to the broadcasters. In other states, where there is not more  than  one licensee of the &#34; A &#34; class, the allotted revenue collected within the state will be paid to that licensee. The licence-fees will be collected by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. There is also provision that where a reasonable public demand exists licensees will be expected to establish, additional broadcasting stations, including relay stations. Subject to a satisfactory service being rendered, the regulations, so far as they relate to class &#34;A&#34; licensees, and the amount in respect of each class of receiving-licence fee apportioned to the broadcasting licensees, will not be altered within a period of two years from the date of issue. At the end of that period rights are reserved to review the position and make such alterations as may be deemed necessary. It is impossible to estimate the extent to which, broadcasting will develop in Australia in the next few years. If the system proposed is successful, and if first-class programmes are broadcasted, it is possible that there will be tremendous expansion, but, on the other &#39;hand, there is no certainty that that will be so. The Government feels that it is essential to place broadcasting on a definite basis, and at the same time to retain power to alter the basis upon which broadcasters are remunerated for their programmes. The date fixed will enable a reliable estimate to be made of the probable expansion of broadcasting. In default of satisfactory service reservations are provided to cancel a licence, or any portion of the rights secured thereunder. </para>

                        <para>- Only one broadcasting licence has been issued in that state, and there will be only one. The licence-fees are on such a low basis that the revenue to be derived cannot possibly be sufficient to support more than one broadcasting station at the present time in each of the States of Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland. The point I have just made is that the licences can be revoked if a satisfactory broadcasting programme is not given. Honorable members will realize that such a provision is essential, because the success of broadcasting depends to a great extent on the public being impressed by the programme rendered. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General. For the purpose of fixing receiving licence-fees . the territory will be divided into three zones, giving roughly a 250-mile radius in the first zone, a radius of 150 miles extending beyond the first in the second zone, and the rest of the territory of the state constituting the third zone. The basis on which fees are to be charged is different in each of the zones. The fees are to be based upon the principle that the licensee who is in the 250-miles zone will probably receive a better service than the licensee who is situated further away, and, consequently, licensees in the inside zone will pay a larger amount, though only a fraction more, than those in the outside zones. The proposed fees per annum are : - </para>

Honorable members will notice that under the present proposal there is to be a reduction in the licence-fee for the second year. The Government feels that it must do this, notwithstanding the fact that it is in a position to alter the whole basis of the arrangement with the broadcasting companies after two years. There may be a tremendous expansion in the number of receiving licences issued, and, as the broadcasting companies are to receive part of the licence-fees paid for the service rendered, the position at the end of the first year may be such that the broadcasting companies will be receiving an amount far in excess of what the service being rendered merits. Therefore, for the first year, we have fixed a figure which we think will give a reasonable return to the broadcasters. We have reduced the fee for the second year, and at the end of the second year it will be open to the Government to review the whole basis of the remuneration to the broadcasting companies. It must be recognized, on the other hand, that there may not be such an expansion as is anticipated, and  the amount derived by the companies under the present proposals may not give them sufficient remuneration to ensure the giving of a first-class programme. The Government is, therefore, prepared to consider taking some action so that there will not be a reduction of revenue to the broadcasters in the second year. That, however, Will not affect the reduction in the licence-fee. Some such action may be particularly necessary in those states where there are comparatively small populations, and where there may not be an expansion of broadcasting sufficient to create a revenue large enough to ensure a first-class service. Dealers will be licensed and will be charged per annum as follows: - Zone 1, ?5; zone 2, ?3; and zone 3, ?2. There will be no restrictions on the design of equipment or the sale of apparatus by registered dealers. Experimental licences will be issued in cases where the. department is satisfied that the applicant possesses sufficient knowledge to undertake scientific research and investigations. The charges per annum will be: - Zone 1, ?1; zone 2, 17s. 6d. ; zone 3, 15s. The revenue to be collected by way of licence-fees will be apportioned between the department and the broadcasting licensees. The amount that the post office will retain out of each fee is 5s. ; the balance will go to the broadcasting company, where there is only one in the state, or will be apportioned between the two broadcasting companies operating in the larger states. Penalties are provided for breaches of the regulations. One must lay considerable stress upon this point, for, under the original proposal, with sealed sets, only a person who had made a payment to the broadcasting company could receive the service which that company was giving; but under the new regulations there will be open sets in use, and anybody who has one can pick up any programme. Obviously, it will be most necessary to police these regulations, and be very strict in regard to them, for a person receiving a broadcasted programme without having paid his licence-fee, will be almost in the position of a man receiving goods without having paid anything for them. The complete regulations are almost ready, and the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department hopes to issue them within a few days. </para>

I desire to refer to the subject of, the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. The honorable member for Fremantle &#34;(Mr. Watson) has been particularly busy in trying to get compensation for the economic losses sustained by those who were affected by the outbreak. Honorable members from the western state have waited patiently, and to-day, in answer to a deputation that waited on the Prime Minister on the 12th June, the &#39; following reply was received by me: - </para>

                <para class="block">In one case a woman with, a milk round had her cattle destroyed, and she was paid only for the loss of her herd. She received no compensation for the loss of her means of business, and she has now no means of livelihood. I could quote other instances where the results of the action of the Government were equally serious. It is said that &#163;21,000 was paid by the Commonwealth, and that a similar sum was granted by the Government of Western Australia, which I claim should not have been required by the Commonwealth to pay anything towards making good the loss of the cattle and pigs and the loss due to the burning of barns. Nothing, however, has been done to repair the economic loss sustained. The people concerned were so infuriated at the time that the honorable member for Fremantle had to go with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> and try to explain to the justly-indignant settlers the object of the action of the Commonwealth authorities. A meeting was convened, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> assured the farmers that, so far as he was concerned, he could say that the Commonwealth would see that full compensation was paid. With that understanding the settlers submitted to the destruction of their property, so that Australia should be saved from the menace of a dreaded cattle disease. Claims for loss of business have been put in to the extent of over &#163;50,000. I have no doubt that in this case, as in others, some <inline font-style="italic">people</inline> submitted larger claims than they should have presented, but the loss can be readily assessed, and there is no reason why the Government should not pay just compensation. This is not a state matter. The Federal Government was responsible for the destruction of the cattle, and it should make good the loss. The action taken was for the protection of Australia generally. Why should a few struggling settlers in one part of the continent be made to suffer? The Government has been open-handed enough with regard to other claims. Recently, it paid to the Central Wool Committee &#163;275,000 in respect of a claim which we on this side of the House contended had no foundation whatever. Last year the Government agreed to remit &#163;1,300,000 in taxation to certain large land-owners. In this &#91;83&#93; matter, practically the whole of the people of Western Australia are up in arms, and no wonder, because the action of the Government in destroying stock took away the means of livelihood from quite a number of persons. Compensation for the loss of cattle is not sufficient. I want to know what compensation this Government intends to give the people who have lost their means of livelihood. Why should a small body of people in my state be penalized? Their claim is a just one, and I trust that the final word has not been said on this matter by the Government. I was surprised to receive this letter. I had not expected that the question would be so definitely closed. I do not intend to let the matter rest without my protest, and an effort to see that justice is done. I hope that the efforts made by the honorable member for Fremantle will yet be successful and compensation for the economic loss will be paid to the people concerned. It is a reflection upon our system of party government that honorable members representing the people most concerned are content, except in the case of the honorable member for Fremantle, to sit in this House with folded arms, and allow this claim for economic loss to be disposed of without a protest. Practically, in this matter, the honorable member for Fremantle stands alone so far as those on the Government side of the House are concerned. Up to the present there has not been a public protest in this chamber, but I am prepared, anyhow, to speak. I hope that the Government will yet do justice to these people. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has seen fit to deliver a lecture on etiquette to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green).</inline> The &#34;honorable member himself is not such an exemplar as to be privileged to lecture other honorable members in this House on etiquette. &#165;e have been told that the matter has been in the hands of the &#34;honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Watson).</inline> If so, why does the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> jump into the breach ? Why does he not leave the business to the honorable member for Fremantle? Although this question does not affect the people of my own division I can see a strong case for demanding that justice be meted out to the people concerned. In the letter received by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie the Government states that, in view of the undesirable precedent that might be created, the claim against- the Commonwealth for economic loss in connexion with the rinderpest outbreak, cannot be recognized. I wish to goodness this government would take notice of some of the precedents established by it during the last two years. It has paid away large sums of money for which there wa&#187; neither moral nor legal claim, and whilst in this case there may not be a legal claim for compensation for economic loss, there is certainly <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> strong moral claim. The Government, in order to combat the rinderpest outbreak, sent officers to Western Australia and ordered the people in the affected area to destroy their stock. I have no quarrel with that. The Gover.uni.eut, in my opinion, took the right course. The expenditure of scores of thousands of pounds would not bo too much to prevent the spread of an. awful disease like  rinderpest  in Australia, because, unchecked, it might involve tha Commonwealth in the loss of many millions of pounds. If, as is suggested, this question of economic loss is a state matter, why did not the Commonwealth Government leave it to the state? As a matter of fact, the prevention of the spread of any disease in Australia is essentially a Commonwealth matter, and the Commonwealth Government quite properly took steps to see that stock that were diseased, or stock likely to spread disease in a given area, were destroyed. Having done that, it was clearly the duty of the Government to pay, not only for the value of stock destroyed, but for the whole of the loss incurred by the people as a - result of the Government policy. This question should not require argument at all. It is an elementary principle of justice. The economic loss following such action may be much greater than the actual value of stock destroyed, because in a milking season one cow may return in butter production alone her full market value. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie waited patiently until he received this letter, and then he took the first opportunity of making his protest in the place where his voice ought to be heard, namely, in this chamber. This matter cannot bo confined within the boundaries of any particular division in the Commonwealth. It concerns every honorable member in this chamber. Why do. not honorable members opposite get up in their places and protest ? Why are they like dumb, driven cattle.? Evidently, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is the only one with sufficient courage to speak in -this matter. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member, by his silence, is making this a party matter. Since he has become Whip of this Government he has not dared to open his month in criticism of its actions. Prior to his appointment as Whip, and when he was sitting in the corner as an alleged critic of the Government, his voice was often heard, but since his fortunes have been linked up with those of this composite government . he says nothing. If the honorable member was doing his duty to his constituents, if, for once in a while, he could forget party interests, and give some thought to the welfare of the people he represents, he would try to see that justice was done in this matter. I commend the honorable member for Kalgoorlie for having brought this question up to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - I very much regret that the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia should have been treated, as it has been to-day. Every honorable member who knows anything about the matter is aware that the* id aim for payment of compensation for the economic loss sustained by the people whose stock were destroyed, bus been pressed to the fullest degree by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watson).</inline> That honorable member has left no stone unturned in urging their claims, both as to the amount of compensation for the loss of stock, and compensation for the economic loss. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> was one of a deputation, attended by nil the members from Western Australia, which placed the claim before the Ministry. </para>

                        <para>- I think that all those who were present on that occasion will admit that the honorable member for Fremantle was the moving spirit, and that,, at the time of the outbreak, he rendered the greatest possible assistance to the Government in dealing with a very difficult situation. I entirely agree with the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the ordinary courtesies usually observed by one member to another should have been shown by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, to the honorable member for Fremantle, who should have been advised of the action which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie proposed to take to-day. The matter could very well have been left with the honorable member for Fremantle. It is lamentable that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> having no knowledge of the subject at all, should simply peruse the letter quoted by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, and then proceed to deal with it from a strictly party stand-point. I very much regret the way in which this matter has been treated, because it is a very serious question. To many of the people concerned it is a life and death matter. No one who has had to consider it, could have any feelings other than those of the deepest sympathy for the owners whose stock had to be destroyed. But in this question there is involved probably one of the largest issues which the government of any country could be called upon to face. I refer to the claim for compensation for economic loss sustained as the result of action taken by the Government. There have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain and in America, and outbreaks of other diseases in other countries. On every occasion this question of economic loss has been discussed and disallowed. Obviously, if it were admitted it would be impossible for any one to say where the principle might lead a government in the future. It was on these grounds, and on these grounds only, that the Government felt obliged to refuse to admit the principle of responsibility for economic loss in connexion with the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. As regards the other side of the question, compensation for the destruction of stock, the Government has paid its full share. It is not on that point, however, that the greatest stress is laid by the honorable member for Fremantle. He has been urging the payment of compensation for economic loss sustained by the people concerned. As I have already said, this principle, if admitted, might have very far-reaching effects in the future. That being so, no honorable member should treat it from a party stand-point; there should not be any attempt to make political capital out of it. I regret the stand which the Government has had to take on the claim for economic loss; but after the fullest investigation, we came to the conclusion thai it was impossible to admit the principle. No one can say what outbreaks may take place in the future. They may not be confined to our flocks or herds. There may be outbreaks of epidemic diseases amongst the people. If we admitted the principle, and paid compensation for economic loss to people against whom action had to be taken in the interests of the nation, it would be impossible to say where it might lead us in the future. For this reason the Government had to refuse the claim. </para>
