            <para>-I did not see in the press the statement to which the honorable member refers, but some few days ago I heard some reference to a Constable Green having been in possession of certain information. Inquiries were then made, and itwas found that that information was not brought under the notice of the Home and Territories Department or of the Administrator of the Northern Territory. It has come to light only within the last few days, when the reports have appeared in the press. There is no further statement to make on the subject of the rescue proceedings, but the Government is endeavouring to send  a  wireless operator to Elcho Island so that communication can be established with those engaged in the work of rescue. I should like to remind honorable members that whilst wireless communication is of very great interest to the people of Australia, it can render no assistance in the work of rescuing the unfortunate women who are alleged to bc in the hands of the blacks. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>ANSTEY  (Bourke) &#91;3.91.  -  I am very sorry to have to make any reference to a matter which has become the subject of an inquiry by  a  royal commission, and I would certainly never indulge in criticism of the character of that of the distinguished gentlemen who form the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, and have attacked &#39; a commission appointed by the State </para>
          <para class="block">Government. But there are certain matters which I consider, it important to bring under notice. I direct attention to the fact that, on the 7th, 19th, 20th, and 21st August, the  honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin);</inline> in conjunction with other members of the Opposition, condemned the Government for its maladministration of the Taxation Department, and, in particular, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> as the Minister responsible for that department. The Prime Minister stated that he would refer the allegations made to a royal commission, A royal commission of one, in the person of Judge Edwards, of New South Wales, was appointed. The judge, sitting as a commissioner, is not permitted to base his investigations upon a perusal of the parliamentary proceedings, so that he may form his own opinion as to what the allegations were. On the contrary, the accused have drawn up their own indictment, and they bar the judge, from considering any statement by the honorable member for Yarra other than such statements, or portions of statements, as the Government has thought fit to include in it. The judge was handed extracts from speeches made by the honorable member for Yarra on the 7th and 19th August, but no references to statements made on the 20th and 21st August. The judge is permitted to inquire only &#34;into the matters referred to in the extracts &#34; submitted to him. The extracts presented are torn from their contexts, and important statements made by the honorable member for Yarra are excluded from tlie investigation. The main accuser is the honorable member for Yarra, but he was not consulted about the terms of reference. Parliament, also, was not consulted.  While such action might be justified if the Government was an uninterested party, it becomes an entirely different proposition when the conduct of the Government is itself in question. I respectfully submit that the terms of reference should not have been drawn up by a Government that is vitally interested in the decision, especially when it has been charged with interference in the administration of the law. I further submit that not mere extracts from the speeches of the honorable member for Yarra, but the whole of his speeches on the Taxation Department, should have been presented to the judge for him to decide which parts were extraneous and which were germane and vital to the issue. Members of the Opposition do not wish to enter into a controversy on a subject that will be judicially investigated, but we regard it as our bounden duty, at this early stage, to make our view clear. </para>

            <para>. - Like the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> I shall not enter into a controversy on a subject that will be investigated by a royal commission., but I point out to the honorable member that the reference to the commission has been drawn in the widest possible terms. . In addition to extracts from the speeches of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> certain general questions have been submitted for the commissioner&#39;s particular consideration. The honorable member for Yarra is entitled to be present at the inquiry, and the Government has placed at his disposal the services of counsel, who will be able to make to the commission any representations desired by the honorable member. Any member of this House, or any person in the community who reads the terms of reference, must come to the conclusion that they cover everything that it is desirable to investigate; and in view of the fact that the honorable member for Yarra will be present in person, and will be represented by counsel, every facility is provided for a full inquiry, which the Government very much welcomes. </para>

            <para>.- While I shall follow the example of the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in not discussing; a question that is to be investigated by a royal commission, I wish to support the statements made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and to deny emphatically those made by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that the reference to the royal commission had been drawn in the widest possible terms. I invite honorable members to read -the terms of reference. I invite them to read the extracts that have been torn from the context of my speeches. I invite them, also, to have regard to the opinion of the judge who has been appointed commissioner. He distinctly informed me that he could not investigate anything outside the questions of  the extracts taken from my speeches. I had with me statements taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Barnard</inline> report of those speeches, but he said that he had nothing to do with them, but only with the extracts supplied to him in the terms of reference. I draw the attention of honorable members to the fact that definite statements made by me have not been referred to the commissioner for investigation, and that direct and definite charges are excluded from the scope of the commission. For example, I made a definite statement that the law of this country was not observed, in that section 9 of the act, which requires the presentation of annual reports to Parliament, was not being obeyed. That was a definite and serious charge of a breach of the law, but it is not included in the questions to the judge. I also asked for the names of the big companies and individuals that were in arrears with the payment of their taxation. I was informed that the names could not be supplied to me, because it was not the practice to reveal them. I made the charge that the Government had revealed such information in some cases, and had refused to reveal it in others, and I alleged unfair discrimination by the Government. No question on that charge has been submitted to the judge. I made a general charge that the Government had interfered with the collection of land taxation, and that for seven years certain taxation had not been  collected. I raised the question why a sum of over &#163;1,600,000 due on Crown leaseholds had not been collected. That question has not been submitted to the judge for investigation and decision. On the other side, I draw attention to the questions that have been submitted to the judge. One of them calls upon me to prove something I did not say. It puts into my mouth words that cannot be found in any part of my speech, and designedly frames the question in such a way as to get one answer, and one only, and that favorable to the Government. Another question has been submitted to the judge with the deliberate intention of showing that the figures I quoted in the House were incorrect. As the Govern.ment well knows, my calculations were based on figures supplied by the. Treasurer. I cite these few facts to show that the reference to the commission is not wide where it ought to be wide, and is wide where it ought to be specific. The object appears to be to avoid getting decisions on the definite charges I made. </para>

            <para>. - When royal commissions have been appointed in the past, it has been the practice to submit the terms of reference to them to the House. Why was that not done in this instance? The action of the Government in not acquainting the House with the terms of reference is an act of discourtesy to honorable members. It may be true that the terms of reference have been published in all the newspapers, but I certainly did not notice them. I should like to know whether the Crown Law Department or the Cabinet drew up the terms of reference, for I do not wish to blame the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> or the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> if the Law Department is responsible. If the Law Department drew up the terms of reference, did it receive any  specific instructions from the Government ? </para>

            <para>.- I am quite sure that honorable members of all parties are unanimous in their desire to have this matter thoroughly investigated. They wish every opportunity to be given to the honorable member for Yarra to prove the charges he made. There appears to be a difference of opinion  regarding the reference to the royal commission. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said that the scope of the commission is sufficiently wide, but some honorable members opposite have said that its scope is not wide enough. That  question can be left where it is until the commission meets. If the honorable member for Yarra finds that the scope of the commission is not wide enough to permit him to submit evidence to prove his charges, it will be competent for the commission to recommend the Government to extend its scope. The Government might at this stage give the House an assurance that if the commission is of opinion that evidence which the honorable member for Yarra desires to submit is outside its scope, the terms of reference will be extended. </para>

            <para>.- I agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning).</inline> Probably before the commission meets, Parliament will be in recess, and we should have an assurance from the Government that&#34; if, as the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has said, the terms of reference are not wide enough to cover the charges he has made, they will be amended. After all, the person to decide whether the terms of reference are comprehensive enough to allow him to state his case to the commissioner, is the honorable member who made the accusation, and not the Ministers or the departmental heads who are accused. The Government&#39;s neglect to consult the honorable member for Yarra in this regard was more than a lack of courtesy. If the terms of reference are not so extended as to cover the whole accusation, the royal commission will satisfy nobody. In the interests of justice, the request of the honorable member for Yarra should be acceded to. During recent weeks, debates have taken place regarding the interpretation to be placed upon a promise made by a former Prime Minister, and honorable members realized that the only person who could say definitely what that promise meant was the man who made it. Similarly, the only person who can say what was meant by the charges against the Government, in regard to the noncollection of land taxation, is the honorable member who made them. </para>

          <para>Mr.FENTON  (Maribyrnong) &#91;3.23&#93;.- A simple and proper procedure would have been to hand over to the commissioner copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing the speeches of the honorable member for Yarra, and allow the commissioner to discover the charges and investigate them. If that were done, nobody could complain. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has told us that he has already appeared before the commissioner, who informed him that he was bound by the terms of reference. Apparently, the inquiry will be confined to a few set phrases torn from the context of the honorable member&#39;s speech. The charges which the honorable member made are contained in his speeches; let them be investigated fully; but when a Ministry which isaccused of certain acts of maladministration, appoints  a  commission to inquire into those charges, but limits the scope of the investigation, it appears to be guilty of what the Americans term  a  &#34; frame up.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- Looking casually into the commission,  T.  do not see how the Government could fairly and honestly insert in the terms of reference the word &#34; exclusively,&#34; which was not used by the honorable member for Yarra, whose speech clearly showed that he meant &#34; mainly.&#34;  The honorable member made a statement that, in respect to taxation on freeholds, &#163;800,000 was owing. That was the result of a calculation based on the Treasurer&#39;s statement that the amount owing on leaseholds was &#163;1,300,000. The deduction of that amount from the &#163;2,114,000, which was the total outstanding land taxation, gave a remainder of &#163;800,000, apparently owing on freehold property. But the Treasurer subsequently amended his statement by declaring that the amount due on leaseholds was &#163;1,600,000. That decreased the liabilities in respect of freeholds, but the royal commission is merely asked to declare whether it is  a  fact that &#163;800,000 is due on freeholds, and the Government knows that the answer must be in the negative. The amended statement by the Treasurer is omitted from the reference, and thus the figures of the honorable member for Yarra will be made to appear wrong, whereas the error was in the original information given by the Treasurer. I shall say no more. We have made our protest, and it was better to do it before the inquiry commenced, than afterwards. </para>

            <para>- The question is stated in an ambiguous way. It is not clear whether it relates to an agricultural farm for which a freehold title has been obtained before the sale, or to a case in which lease has not yet been actually converted into a freehold. If what was sold was a lease with a right of conversion into a freehold by the purchaser, but had not been converted to a freehold by the date of the sale, the vendor of the lease is subject to the provisions of section 16 <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-1923, and if there is any part of the proceeds of the sale return  able  as income under that section, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation must assess it for income  tax.  The Government proposes to introduce legislation which will exempt for the future the proceeds of the sale of leases with a right of purchase. </para>

            <para>- The question of prohibiting the importation of all kinds of synthetic or artificially compounded fruit essences and flavours is now under consideration. It will be necessary for the states to co-operate to prevent misleading labels being applied to goods manufactured in Australia, or to imported goods after the latter have been released from control of the Customs Department. In instances where the synthetic essences are manufactured in Australia, the matter is entirely one for state legislation. </para>

          <para class="block">This bill is introduced because the Government realizes the necessity for taking action to provide for the control of the export of Australia&#39;s surplus production of dairy produce. The purpose of the measure is to establish a board to organize the overseas market for Australian butter and cheese. All who study our present national circumstances must realize that the marketing of our surplus production is one of the greatest problems that we have to face. It is impossible for us to maintain our White Australia policy, or our present standard of living, or to ensure our national safety, unless we increase our population. But it is of no use for us to increase our population unless every individual who enters the country becomes a productive unit, and even productive units are of no value to us unless a payable market is available for their production. The problem of marketing our surplus production has become acute in the last few years. For many years our production was only sufficient to meet the requirements of the home market, and both our primary and secondary industries were in a substantial position, because our own people were able to purchase all their products. Gradually we reached the point when our production exceeded our home requirements, and of late years we have had to send more and more of our surplus production overseas. We are now faced with the position that unless we can find more extensive markets abroad it will be of no use for us to increase our production, and unless we can do so the development of our country will cease. That would be most detrimental to Australia. The interests of our primary and secondary industries are closely allied. Our secondary industries are absolutely dependent for their prosperity upon the success of our primary industries, and it is to our primary industries that we look to provide the greater part of our national finance. Australia is a debtor country, and we shall never overtake our indebtedness until we are able profitably to dispose of our large exportable surplus of good? in the markets of the world. The Gover: ment appreciates this position.  another of  our national problems that will neve be solved until we overcome the difficulties of marketing our products, is the concentration of the great bulk of our population in our cities. It is unfortunate in any country for the great majority of its people to live in its cities, but it is peculiarly deplorable in a country like Australia, for its wonderful potential resources can never be developed while its population is so settled. In view of all these circumstances, the necessity for giving careful consideration to the exploitation of oversea markets for our products is apparent. It may be that this bill is the right step to take to develop the necessary markets abroad, but if it is not, some other step must be taken, for the problem must be solved if Australia is to remain prosperous. In practically all our primary industries, there is an exportable surplus for which, with the exception of wool, we are finding it difficult to secure a profitable market. It is therefore necessary to attempt to meet the position without delay. The primary producer has to incur not only the ordinary risks of business, but two additional clearly defined classes of risk. In Australia, he is subjected to the natural risks due to seasonal vicissitudes, and he is also faced with great marketing risks. These drawbacks are so great that the great majority of the people living in the cities would hesitate long before accepting them. While much has been done to overcome the climatic risks with which the primary producer is faced, he will always be dependent to a considerable extent on the conditions that prevail from year to year. We havehad evidence of what can be done in the economic production of wheat in semi.arid areas, and steps have been taken to counteract the effects of periodical droughts by the storage of fodder. We hope that many disadvantages will be overcome as improved systems of transport are provided throughout the country. But despite all the scientific knowledge they may bring to the assistance of agriculture, thereby increasing the efficiency of their methods, the primary producers will always have to face great seasonal fluctuations. No other branch of industry is so liable to extraordinary instability of prices. There are wider variations in the prices of primary products than of almost any other commodity, due to a large extent to the fact that particular classes of produce have to be marketed every year at a particular period, and to the fact that the requirements of the consumer do not vary according to the seasons. The needs of the consumers are continuous, and are an inelastic quantity from year to year, but the supply is not continuous throughout the year, and it varies from year to year. Furthermore, a good season, with bountiful production, may not prove a blessing to the producer, for it may result in overproduction for that particular period, and decreased prices. The financial results to the producer, after a good season climatically, may not be so satisfactory as after a moderate season. On the other hand, when unfavorable meteorological conditions have resulted in a small production in, say, Australia, it may be that there is a tremendous production in other parts of the world, and therefore our producer receives no enhancement of price as a result of the diminution in the local supply. </para>

              <para>- The difficulties to be overcome are the natural risks and the marketing risks to which the industries are subject, but the bill before the House deals primarily with the marketing risks. Our primary products are disposed of partly on the Australian market, and partly on the overseas markets, and this Parliament must .recognize the nature and the extent of its obligations. The home or local markets are a responsibility of the states, but the disposal of our export surplus on the overseas markets is a matter that vitally concerns the Commonwealth The bill deals solely with the marketing overseas of Australia&#39;s surplus dairy production, and has no reference to the local marketing. The necessity for organizing and controlling the marketing of our surplus products must be obvious to anybody who has had an opportunity of visiting the overseas markets, particularly those in Great Britain. To-day we are faced, not only with the organized competition of the Argentine Meat Trust and monopolies of that character, but we also have to contend against the organized opposition of industries in all primary producing countries, in many of which the industries receive government assistance and have the advantage of government banks. This complete&#39; change in the situation has been brought about by the economic disturbance due to the late war. While in pre-war days the marketing in <inline font-style="italic">Great</inline> Britain of the primary . products of most countries was done through individual channels, and there was no coordination of effort between the producers of any one country, the position is very different to-day. In the British market, at any rate, Australia&#39;s surplus production will have to be disposed of in competition with the co-ordinated and cooperative marketing of our competitors. In the disposal of nearly all our great primary products there are innumerable sellers in- London competing for the custom of a limited number of buyers. If we continue to do business on those lines, we shall certainly be at a serious disadvantage in comparison with other countries. After the Imperial Conference last year, I spent a good deal of time in obtaining as much information as I could concerning the. marketing methods being adopted in connexion with Australia&#39;s surplus production. The first thing that was obvious to me was that our supplies were coming forward through different agents, and that there was no co-ordination of effort on the part of the sellers of the produce.&#39; Another fact that impressed me was the lack of continuity of supplies. There is a period when a great deal of Australian produce is on the market. Possibly, by some great effort, by organization and propaganda, we might succeed in establishing a market for one of our primary products, such as dried fruits ; but, having done SO, through lack of continuity of supplies, the demand that had been created among the people of Great Britain could not be regularly met and the market would be lost. Another feature of the British market that strikes one is the loss of identity of Australian productions. In the case of butter, for instance, when the Australian article reaches Great Britain, it is sold by different persons; there is no coordination and the butter loses its identity altogether. At present, we are doing nothing to establish what is almost the greatest asset that one who is trying to sell anything can possess, and that is the good will of the persons to whom he is trying to sell. Another factor which has to be considered is the insufficiency of the propaganda carried on for the advertising of Australia&#39;s productions. Something is being done at the present time to overcome .that difficulty in connexion with the exhibition at Wembley. It is essential that Australia should adopt better methods of propaganda in order to make her productions known to the people of Great Britain. From what I observed when I was in the Old Country, I am quite certain that if our productions were really brought under the notice of the British people, it would be found that a majority of them have a sympathetic desire to obtain their supplies from Australia. I was convinced that we shall be at a disadvantage, and shall never be in a satisfactory position until we organize the marketing and selling of the export productions of our primary industries. This must be done in such a way as to retain the Australian identity  of our produce, to secure the continuity of supplies, control over our own production, and marketing in an orderly manner. There is another reason why we should realize that organization of our export services is necessary. At the Economic Conference, the questions of markets and preference were discussed at very great length. I moved a resolution that a permanent economic committee, consisting of representatives of all the self-governing parts of the Empire, should be appointed to consider the problems of Empire marketing. I suggested that it should have as its fundamental function the consideration of schemes which would lead to greater consumption of Empire productions in Great Britain, on a basis that would be mutually advantageous to the dominions producer and the British consumer. That scheme was accepted, and the Economic Conference recommended the establishment of such a committee. Subsequently the British Government changed its mind, and indicated that it was not desirous of going on with the scheme. That intimation came as a very considerable surprise to me, because I had discussed the matter with Ministers of the new Government, and found that they were favorable to it. Later the British Government again changed its mind, and some two or three months ago communicated with the dominions saying that it was desirous of going on with the scheme for the establishment of an economic committee, and asking whether the dominions were prepared still to co-operate. I understand that all the dominions have agreed to do so, and it is only a question of time when such a committee will be established. If it is brought into existence, and frames any schemes designed to benefit dominion producers, and at the same time assist consumers, of dominions productions in Great Britain, it cannot be expected that they will be successful, unless our great primary industries establish some orderly marketing system and control over their own productions. This, if no other reason existed, should be sufficient to recommend to this House some measure of control of the marketing of Australian productions. With regard to the bill now under consideration, dealing with the export of butter, I may say that proposals were submitted to the Commonwealth Government some mouths ago, asking that action should be taken to control the interstate trade and to fix the prices upon which it should be carried on. The Government refused to accept a scheme of that character, because it would be contrary to: the whole spirit of federation. When the Commonwealth came into being, it was intended that there should be no longer any restriction of trade between the states. To establish such a control as was suggested would certainly be a negation of the federal idea. The Government felt that it would not ultimately have been in the interests of the industry itself to take such action as was suggested. On a previous occasion I explained at great length why we took that view, and I do not propose to repeat what I said then. We also felt that the admission of such a principle would in the end be found to be disadvantageous to every one in the community, including those engaged in the production of dairy produce. If it were admitted that we should fix the price of butter, we should have to apply the same principle to all the other great necessities of the people, and this would inevitably tend to an increase in the cost of all commodities so dealt with. The cost of living would be increased, the rates of wages would be raised, and we should eventually get back to the point at which we are starting today. We should be faced with the same problems as those which are giving us so much difficulty at the present time. The Government would not accent the proposal, but at a conference of the dairying industry which I attended I indicated that we were quite prepared to consider the advisability of controlling the export surplus of dairy produce. As a result of the conference, certain proposals were submitted to the Government for legislation which might be introduced in order to give effect to the control proposed. At the conference I suggested that there should be some voluntary arrangement amongst those engaged in the industry, and if that could not be brought about, I said that the Government was prepared to bring down legislation following somewhat on the lines of the New Zealand act, unless the conference could submit a proposal which appeared to the Government to be more satisfactory. I indicated to those engaged in the industry that if orderly marketing were brought about, and a continuity of supply provided for, that would probably involve the holding of a certain amount of butter in cold storage, which would mean additional expenditure, and it might, further, be necessary to provide additional funds in order to make advances to producers directly. The Government indicated that it would be prepared to consider the question of granting financial assistance to the industry on the basis of advances against butter. Those engaged in the industry, after considering the proposals submitted at the conference, intimated to the Government that they did not anticipate that any financial assistance would be required. and that the industry would be able to finance itself. The Government is proposing to bring down a measure complementary to that now under consideration, giving the power in dealing with primary industries in connexion with which boards have been created to control the export trade, to make advances up to an amount not exceeding SO per cent, of the market value of the commodity over which the control board has authority. The Government has considered the proposals which the conference put forward, and the measure now under consideration is to a very large extent based upon those proposals and the New Zealand act. New Zealand was faced with the problems that confront us, and the New Zealand Parliament passed two acts to deal with them. It appointed control boards for two industries. In 1922, a control board was established for the meat industry, and, in 1923, one was established for the dairying industry. The act dealing with the meat, industry gives very wide powers, but they have not been exercised up to date. All the people interested in the industry have recognized the existence of the board of control, and have realized that the best results can be expected from co-operation amongst themselves. There has, so far, been no necessity for the exercise of any of the stringent powers contained in the act. The Meat Board in New Zealand at the present time is controlling all shipping of products in the industry. lt makes freight arrangements on behalf of the industry as a whole. It also regulates the monthly export quota of frozen meat from New Zealand. In addition, it fixes, every week, a reasonable price for sheep and cattle throughout New Zealand. Apart from this, the board has not interfered with the industry. The underlying principle of the New Zealand act, and also of this bill, -is to leave the industry free to avail itself of the ordinary channels, but to control it in such a way that, instead of those channels being used for the advantage of individuals, they shall be used for the general benefit of all the producers concerned. The bill now before the House provides that in connexion with the dairying industry there shall be a &#34;board of control consisting of ten members. -One member will be elected by the Government; six are to be elected, one from each of the states, by the directors of the co-operative butter and cheese factories; two are to be elected by the proprietary companies; and one is to be appointed by the Government as a representative of the persons engaged as sellers of dairy produce outside the Commonwealth. The constitution of the board is designed to give fair representation to all interests in the industry, but there is, of course, an overwhelming representation of the producers themselves. </para>

              <para>- Yes, if the honorable member wishes to describe him in that way. He will be the representative of one of the interests in the industry. The Government have given great consideration to the matter, and it feels that the board will be seriously handicapped in its work unless there is representation upon it of all the interests in the industry. If it is to function successfully, the representatives of the different interests will be able to bring to its counsels a certain amount of knowledge that should be of very great value to it. However, the constitution of the board is a matter for consideration in committee. The bill provides for an executive of five members. It has been felt that if all executive acts had to be decided upon at meetings of a committee consisting of ten members, the board would be hampered in its work, and it is therefore provided that there shall be an executive of five members drawn from the members of the control board. Provision is made for the establishment of a London agency, and on that agency the Government will have one representative. The agency will derive its authority from the control board, and will act onbehalf of the board in Great Britain. Its functions will be to advise the board with regard to the position of the market in Great Britain, and generally to advise asto the best methods of placing Australia&#39;s surplus dairy produce on the British market. How far its functions will go must depend on the policy framed by the board when it is brought into existence. With regard to the powers of the board itself, the provision upon which the whole success of the bill depends is that no butter shall be exported from Australia except under a licence. That licence will be issued by the Minister for Trade and Customs, but the board will have the power to recommend to the Minister the terms and conditions upon which licences to export butter should be granted. The success of any scheme for the orderly marketing of our surplus dairy production will depend upon the way in which the board exercises its powers. The boards appointed in New Zealand have acted with great wisdom and prudence, and have demonstrated that there is every prospect of success following upon control of the export of butter. It is felt that if the Commonwealth board shows the same degree of prudence in its operations it will bring about a system of orderly marketing of Australia&#39;s surplus dairy production which will prove of great advantage to our producers. The board will have power to accept for export any dairy produce which may be handed to it, and provision is made for that in the bill. The board will be required to secure from the Minister a licence to export on the same terms and with the same restrictions as attach to licences issued to other exporters of butter. </para>

              <para>- Licences will be issued by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the advice of the board. The terms and conditions are to be laid down by the board, but it will be open to the Minister to refuse to grant a licence or to  decline to approve of any conditions laid down by the board. Like the New Zealand Meat and Dairy Control Board, the Australian board will have power to make contracts on behalf of the industry as a whole. By another bill, to be introduced subsequently, an amount not exceeding one-eighth of a penny in the case of butter, or one-sixteenth of a penny in the case of cheese, will be levied on all dairy produce that is exported. The amount so raised will be utilized by the board to further its scheme of marketing. The accounts of the board are to be subject to inspection and audit by the </para>

              <para>- The act will not come into operation until a vote of the producers has been taken and until it is demonstrated that a majority of those producers are anxious to have this form of control over the exportation of their produce. In adopting that course, we are following the procedure of New Zealand in regard to meat and butter control. The establishment of control over the export of butter is a matter which does not affect the community as a whole and for that reason it is thought desirable to take a vote of the producers only before bringing a scheme into operation. The Government believe that the control proposed will prove of advantage to the producers and of subsequent benefit to the people of Australia generally. But it is only fair that the people directly engaged in the industry should be given an opportunity to express their opinion on an issue which concerns primarily themselves alone, and not the general community, for whom we legislate in the ordinary way in this Parliament. </para>

The principle to be considered on the second reading is the necessity for establishing a better system for the orderly marketing of our surplus production of dairy produce in Great Britain. The actual method proposed to be adopted is a matter . for consideration in committee. There is no doubt in the mind of any one who knows the present position of the markets of the world that it is essential for Australia to have a better system for the orderly marketing of its surplus production. New Zealand has set us an example by the adoption of a scheme which shows every sign of being successful, to the great benefit of the producers of the dominion. A proper system of control should place Australia in a better position to participate in any scheme that may subsequently be devised by the proposed Imperial Economic Committee. I have every confidence in recommending the bill for acceptance. It is the first step towards that organization of our primary industry which is so necessary. I am sure it will prove to be of great benefit to the producers of butter and cheese, and, ultimately, of benefit to the people of Australia as a whole.. </para>

            <para>. - I moveThat the bill be now read a second time. The provisions of this bill are almost identical with those of the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill. The measure relates solely to the export of dried fruits, and sets up a control board and a London agency, as does the other bill, with this difference, however, that this board will consist of six persons, as against ten provided for in the other measure. Of these six, one will be appointed by the Governor-General to represent the Commonwealth, three will be elected by the producers, and two will be appointed by the Governor-General for their commercial experience. It is thought that a,board of six can function without an executive such as has been provided for in the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill. Another measure subsequently to be introduced will provide for a levy of not more than one-eighth of a penny on each pound of dried fruit exported. The success of this bill will be more dependent on a third bill than will that of the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill. A few weeks ago, a measure was passed by this Parliament giving financial assistance to the dried fruits industry. The position of the industry is such that the growers cannot finance the export of their surplus produce. This is mainly due to the fact that under the land settlement schemes of the states many returned soldiers have been established in the industry, and there has been such a tremendous increase in production that the position of home consumption and export figures has been completely reversed. Instead of our consuming 80 per cent, of the production, leaving 20 per cent, available for export, our home consumption of dried fruits now accounts for only 20 per cent, of the production, leaving 80 per cent, for which a market must be provided overseas. The financial circumstances of those engaged in the industry are such that they are obliged to rely upon the assistance given by the bill already passed, and by another bill to be introduced, under which the Government will advance an amount not exceeding SO per cent, of the market value of the dried fruit available for marketing overseas. </para>

              <para>- No ; when it is in the &#34; sweat-box,&#34; to use the technical terms of the industry. All advances made by the Government will be secured on the fruit itself, and no advance can be made unless the board set up by this bill exercises full control over the fruit. This measure therefore, will operate somewhat differently from the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill, inasmuch as practically all the producers of dried fruits will avail themselves of the financial assistance up to 80 per cent., and they cannot get that assistance until they place their produce in the hands of the board. As a result, Australia&#39;s export of dried fruits will, to a large extent, be in the hands of the board and under its control, and there will be only one marketing authority in Great Britain for these fruits. It will be the task of the board to examine the circumstances of the industry, and to bring about a reduction in the costs between the &#34; sweat box &#34; and the sale of fruit in Great Britain. Those costs are now far too high, but with a properly organized scheme of marketing they could certainly be reduced. There should be a larger margin of profit for the producers, and the Government is hopeful that the board, by its control of the export surplus, will greatly increase this margin. The underlying principles of the Government&#39;s action are identical with these in the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill, and I set them out at such great length in moving the second reading of that bill that I do not now purpose to repeat them. I trust the House will give the. bill a speedy passage, because the industry is unquestionably in very serious difficulties, and unless better prospects are held out for those engaged in it, difficulty will be experienced in keeping them on their blocks. It is alleged in some quarters that there is over-production in the industry. That statement is not correct, for if we could organize our export trade in fruit it would probably be found that the amount grown would be insufficient to supply the markets available. </para>

            <para>.- The Government, having pursued its course of late hours and riotousliving, has now, in the natural order of events, come in juxtaposition with the bankruptcy court. It is said of this bill that it is essentially a lawyer&#39;s bill, and that it can be considered more properly in committee than on the motion for the second reading. The Government is proceeding so rapidly into the haven of recess, in spite of the opposition which the official Opposition, in the interests of the country, is making to its progress, that even I am somewhat loath to place obstacles in itsway. I therefore do not purpose to detain it with a long, or, if I can help it, a tiresome speech. I do not admit that this bill is essentially or necessarily either a lawyer&#39;s bill or one for consideratiou in committee. As a matter of fact, it is well known that the lawver usually loses interest in the estate once it has passed into the hands of the public liquidator. I say of this bill that it is an intensely human document. It is a bill, not. for lawyers, but for poets and melodramatists. It is a bill to inspire the creative genius of writers of romance. It runs the gamut of human emotions, and represents the triumph of bleak experience over radiant hope. From beginning to end, it is a veritable epic of calamity. My speech, so far, is what pressmen would call my &#34;introduction,&#34; and, like most pressmen&#39;s introductions, it has been carefully prepared in advance, with just an artistic semblance of spontaneity to grace it. I adopt gratefully the quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ringwood,</inline> made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom),</inline> when moving the second reading of the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ringwood</inline> states - </para>

            <para>The chief aim of bankruptcy should be to combine and regulate two great objects: first, the distribution of the debtor&#39;s effects in the most expeditious, equal, and economical manner; and, secondly, his release from his creditors, whenhe has made a full disclosure and surrender of his property, and has not been guilty of fraud or misconduct. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ringwood&#39;s</inline> words for a number of reasons. First, he is a master of arts and a barrister-at-law ; secondly - and this is a stronger reason - he is an Irishman ; and, thirdly, and most potently of all, I am convinced that he is a poet. 1 am sure that he did not intend his treatise on the bankruptcy law to be regarded as a poem, but, fortunately, it is so, and, at the risk of appearing to digress even for a moment, I remind the House that it was Coleridge, I think, who wrote a poem on an ass tethered to a stake, and that it was Wordsworth who addressed an ode to a footstool. In the light of those precedents, there is no reason to complain of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ringwood</inline> for writing a poem on bankruptcy. I have spoken of the bill as &#34; an epic of calamity,&#34; but it is only fair to say that the calamity is not always exclusively that of the debtor. Sometimes he rises, like the Phoenix, out of the ashes of his dead self, and soars into the realm of happy prosperity ; while the creditor wilts and fades away until ultimately we find his name in the list of insolvents, where he gives, as one of the reasons of his insolvency, &#34;bad debts.&#34; That is well illustrated by the lines of Goldsmith, who, honorable members will remember, wrote touchingly about the highly respectable citizen who was bitten by a mad dog - </para>

          <para class="block">I observe that the Government have elected to employ the term &#34; bankruptcy,&#34; instead of &#34; insolvency.&#34; &#34; Bankruptcy &#34; is a harsh, ruthless term, while &#34;insolvency,&#34; on the other hand, is soft, delicate, and soothing, like the murmur in the evening of a low tide on a shelving beach. It is curious that, with the idolatry of property that has characterized the evolution of history, inability to pay one&#39;s debt was in other times regarded as a crime in itself, though, in fact, there may have been nothing criminal about it. There was in those days scant regard for human life and emotion and the poetry of existence, but high regard for the transcendent claims of property. For property, men nave been hanged or banished, or even worse things have befallen them. The only presentday parallel for the former harsh treatment of bankrupts is to be found in the vicinity of Melbourne. Proceeding in a north-westerly direction, one may arrive at the suburb known as Flemington, where persons known as &#34; welsher3 &#34; occasionally operate. These persons, on finding their commitments to be in excess of their resources, sometimes take refuge in flight, when their creditors, if sufficiently alert, make a rapid descent upon whatever assets they possess, and when these fail to realize sufficient, execute speedy judgment by throwing the defaulters into the Saltwater River. It is very curious that that was the course adopted in the early days of insolvency proceedings on the shores of the Mediterranean. When the Italian trader at his little bench was found to be in financial difficulties, his  creditors,  instead of going through an elaborate procedure such as that provided for in this bill, simply made a raid upon the bench, and dealt with the debtor in similar summary fashion. The result was described as <inline font-style="italic">banca rot ta,</inline> from which we got <inline font-style="italic">banca</inline><inline font-style="italic">rupta,</inline> and thus our term &#34;bankrupt.&#34; We have passed beyond those unhappy times, but there is an historical case for the distinction between &#34; bankruptcy&#34; and &#34;insolvency,&#34; and I think the Minister is technically right in retaining for the title of this bill the harsher term &#34;bankruptcy.&#34; Insolvency did not apply to traders, but bankruptcy did. &#34; Insolvent &#34; denoted the gentlemanly position of the superior person who could not for the moment pay his debts, and&#39; was suffering from a sort of financial constipation, for which the law provided a mild and painless aperient. In 1861, the provisions of the bankruptcy law were extended to nontraders - to gentlemen as well as to mere men of business. The Attorney-General, with that reverence for tradition which I share, though only to an attenuated extent, has preserved &#34;bankruptcy&#34; as the title for the law which we are considering, and has rejected &#34; insolvency,&#34; a term with which we are more familiar in the State of Victoria, where we have become accustomed to speak of &#34; insolvency &#34; and not of &#34; bankruptcy.&#34; The honorable and learned gentleman has failed in this regard to follow the prac tice of the principal state of the Commonwealth. I have referred to the incidental hardships of the bankrupt, but it has to be borne in mind - in fact, it follows from what I have said - that the bankruptcy laws have ameliorated the condition of the debtor. This legislation is really a paternal interposition of the law in favour of that unfortunate. Not so very many years ago the debtor was thrown into prison. That great reformer, to whom the present and succeeding generations cannot be too grateful - I refer to Charles Dickens - has called attention in some of his powerful books to the conditions under which  debtors  &#34;were in his days imprisoned. Most of his readers will have a lively recollection of the unfortunate incidents which followed the judgment in the immortal case of <inline font-style="italic">Bardell</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pickwick,</inline> when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pickwick</inline> was cast into prison for refusing to pay the damages awarded against him. There he would have remained but for the unexpected advent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Bardell. His</inline> gallant nature not allowing him to leave a lady in distress, he paid what he owed and was forthwith liberated. This incident may seem foreign to the subject under discussion, but it serves to emphasize the fact that there is now no imprisonment for failure to pay one&#39;s debts, though imprisonment may be, and sometimes is, inflicted in certain circumstances for the faudu-lent, non-payment  of debts. That happens when the non-payment has a criminal aspect, and there is what lawyers term mens <inline font-style="italic">rea,</inline> that is, a guilty intention in what is done. The debtor, in the words of the AttorneyGeneral in introducing the bill, and which I adopt, is not to be &#34;merely the prey of the creditor.&#34; It is a good phrase, suggesting the vulture or the carrion crow picking at the bones of a still living caTcass. The law interposes to prevent this. I was entertained, however, by the honorable gentleman&#39;s suggestion that the measure should be regarded as one of some urgency, owing to the manifold and intricate operations of bankruptcy throughout the  Commonwealth.  I find that the subject first came under the purview of this House as a result of a conference which sat in 1907. Its deliberations took form in 1912 in a bill which, by a &#39;stupendous effort, arrived at the first-reading stage. </para>
          <para class="block">In 1914 clause 179 of the then current bill was reached, further consideration being deferred owing to the outbreak of war, when works of  mercy  were abandoned for works of slaughter, and the measure was not taken up again until 1922. The Attorney-General said that the bill was an act of mercy. But I have always thought that mercy should be quick, eager, instant; it is justice that is proverbially heavy-footed and slow, though </para>
          <para class="block">Ave  may flatter ourselves that it is sure. This consideration leads me to think that when the people of succeeding generations are thoughtfully picking the moss from the monument which a grateful public will have erected to the Nationalist party and its Governments, they will say that among many good deeds which they did in a naughty world was to conceive an act of mercy in 1907 </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">One would think that that provision was hardly necessary in view of the terms of the Constitution. There are matters over which this Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction, but bankruptcy is not one of them, and the only limitation that is placed upon the powers of the State Parliaments is in the terms of section 109 of the Constitution, which provides that when a law of the state is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth the latter shall prevail, and the former shall to the extent of such inconsistency be invalid. There is, therefore, no exclusive Commonwealth jurisdiction in the matter of bankruptcy, and I wonder why the clause I have quoted is inserted in the bill. I mention it only because it touches the fundamental jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and affords me an opportunity for pointing, out that in that regard the people owe very little to honorable members opposite. The nation will, I hope, recognize in years &#39;to come that it owes a great deal to members on this side of the House for the efforts they have consistently made to enlarge the powers of this Parliament in face of the stern opposition of the parties now in power. However, the residuum of power still resides with the states. The bill applies to married women, foreigners, and persons enjoying the privileges of Parliament. It has been said that some of us might have had to make use of our privilege, but for certain corporate action which we took in 1920 to fortify ourselves financially. The English statute- upon  which the bill is largely based applies to married women in only a modified degree. The fact is that, with the passage of time and the evolution of circumstances, a married woman&#39;s proprietary rights have been extended until to-day she stands almost on an equality with man in that regard. If there is one thing necessary to put her in the position of complete equality it is that in every department of activity there shall be equal pay for equal work, a principle earnestly advocated by honorable members on this side. The coping-stone will be added to the work of English jurisprudence in that regard when the equal rights of women in the material sense are recognized. Of course, there has never been any limitation .of the prerogative of a wife to render her husband insolvent.  Upon that point I speak historically, and without personal experience. Turning to the English act, I find that peers and members of the House of Commons are conveniently grouped with felons and lunatics. Some people might say that nobody but a lunatic would become insolvent. I counter that by saying that many wise men have done so. The bill proposes the division of the states into districts - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>For the purposes of this act the GovernorGeneral may  declare  any part of the Commonwealth to be a district. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is worthy of serious comment, because it represents the unconscious adoption of Labour&#39;s policy of dividing the Commonwealth, not according to state boundaries, but for greater convenience in local government. It is curious how casually and unwittingly the Government, when dealing with a practical subject of this kind, begins to adopt piecemeal Labour&#39;s ideas. In connexion with the distribution of the bankrupt&#39;s estate, I notice, with regret, that the pampered landlord has not been overlooked. I have no prejudice against the landlord - indeed, for a few fleeting weeks, I myself might have been so designated - but I call him pampered because, under the English law, he is the only person who can seize another person&#39;s property for debt without judgment of a court; indeed, in certain cases he has power without such judgment to pursue, overtake, and seize a debtor&#39;s goods, and we are aware of his long standing prerogative, which he has exercised so freely in many times and places, of evicting the tenant according to processes of law. Under the English act he may continue distraint even after the unfortunate debtor has sequestrated his estate, but it is only fair to say that that power is not retained in this bill. The bill does, however, secure the landlord in his preferential treatment. It is true that the wages of a clerk or servant, for a term of not more than four months and for an amount not exceeding &#163;50, will have priority over the claim of the landlord, but there is a vast difference between the two classes of creditors. To the wage-earner, his wages are everything; and if he does stand out of them patiently, hoping that the undertaking out of which they are to be paid will ultimately prosper, only to find eventually that the business has failed, and his employer has become insolvent, his position becomes very grave indeed, and all systems of bankruptcy have recognized that preference should be given to the wage-earner to secure his wages. This bill does not secure him beyond an amount of &#163;50 and arrears owing for a period of four months. That is a niggardly provision, and I hope that in committee it will be substantially liberalized. It is, 1 thiiik, a copy of the Victorian provision. </para>

              <para>- I am not sure that the Victorian provision is not even less liberal. However, the bill does in another way offer a measure of mercy to the wage-earner who has the misfortune to become insolvent, by providing that his tools, implements, and instruments of trade, and the necessary wearing apparel of himself and family, not exceeding in value &#163;20, shall be exempt from seizure by the trustee. It is curious that at this time in our history, when the prices of twenty years ago have practically doubled, there should be no improved proposal to alter the law to protect the wage-earner in regard to the necessaries of life. I sincerely hope that the Government will not think of insistingupon so poor a safeguard of the interests of the worker who is compelled to take advantage of the insolvency law. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and the same provision appears in the insolvency law of Victoria, and possibly of the other states. I do not propose to go into the details of the bill, which contains a large number of clauses. If I dealt with the measure in detail possibly the Government might be put off the measure for another fifteen years. Now that we are in the mood to pass a Bankruptcy Bill we should do so. Of course, there is every prospect that the bill would, in a certain event, be passed expeditiously after the next general election, for reasons which delicacy forbids me to refer further. But, apart from that consideration, I think this Government might now be allowed to place upon its head the Growning glory of this achievement. It should be entitled to claim that it had passed a Bankruptcy Bill in seventeen years. The measure is really wanted. </para>

In the interests of practical uniformity, in the interests of all classes, including the workers, and in the interests of commerce and manufacture, we should place this bill, in an amended and, I hope, a better and more liberal form, upon the statute-book.

            <para>. - After the very able speech by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> I feel somewhat at a disadvantage, but I have been requested . by a number of people in Queensland, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and trustees, to direct attention to the omission from this bill of certain desirable provisions in the Queensland law passed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith 49 years ago. I shall state the case as briefly as possible. This bill is an extremely intricate measure, of interest chiefly to professional men, business men, and trustees. The bill prohibits assignments for the benefit of creditors. This practice has proved most satisfactory in Queensland, where fully 1,000 estates have been dealt with since Bir Samuel . Griffith passed the Queensland insolvency law in 1874. This law was amended in 1876, and has proved to meet requirements for the last 49 years. The Queensland act extended the theory of fraudulent preference by sections 108 and 109. I trust that the Acting AttorneyGeneral will permit those sections to be inserted in the bill, and when the measure is in committee, I shall move for their inclusion. This bill retains the provisions of section 107 of the Queensland act, which , renders voidable any payments made or security given with a view to giving preference to any creditors. But there is an important omission from this bill, namely, the provisiou that pressure by a creditor shall not protect any transaction. This weakens the efficiency of the clause. To meet the demands of a young country like Australia, the insolvency law should be simple and economical. I fear that, on the contrary, the cost of insolvency proceedings will, under this measure, be enormously increased, and administration made more cumbersome. The bill also omits the Queensland provisions with regard to liquidation by arrangement. This enables instant possession to be taken by creditors, through a receiver, without any law costs, and permits of a reliable report being presented to the first meeting of creditors. It also provides for the punishment of offences and for the recovery of preferences, as well as a veto power io creditors on the debtor&#39;s discharge. Another omission is the Queensland provision for the examination on oath of a debtor by a trustee. This has been found to be extremely beneficial, often saving a court examination, and costs of from &#163;25 to &#163;150, and usually it is quite as effective. There is nothing in the bill to meet cases where creditors wish the business to be carried on for gradual realization, paying the trustee a nominal commission, usually 1 per cent., for his supervision. </para>

              <para>- No. In practice, the system has worked very well. In cases where a debtor may be living 200 or 300 miles away, the trustee is empowered to make an examination on oath, so as to get a true state of his affairs, and report to the meeting of creditors. If the report is favorable, the creditors may assist the debtor by extending his credit until improved seasonal prospects enable him to get on his feet again. </para>

              <para>- No; but in Queensland creditors of a country storekeeper frequently extend his credit, provided he extends the credit of dairymen and other primary producers, who through adverse seasons may not be able to pay him. In this way a debtor is enabled subsequently to meet his obligations. In scores of instances within my knowledge this course has been adopted with every success. </para>

              <para>- It is a very important provision so far as Queensland is concerned. Under this bill a person may not solicit for a trusteeship. I can quite understand that this should apply in Victoria, where the distances are not so great, but in a vast country like Queensland young business men in country towns should not be prevented from soliciting for trusteeships when they could be employed to the advantage of both debtor and creditor. A young fellow in the country who, perhaps, has had experience in a bank or in a stock and station agent&#39;s office, may hear that a storekeeper is in trouble  financially,  and ask to be permitted to act as trustee. The creditors would naturally inquire into his credentials, and if he were capable and honest he might be asked to accept the trusteeship to take an audit and report. In such a case the expense of sending a trustee from Brisbane or Rockhampton away out west would be saved. No objection can possibly be taken to the practice of soliciting for trusteeships, hut under the bill it will be an offence. No fault &#34;has been found with the Queensland provision. The manager of one of the largest trustee firms in Brisbane has informed me that he cannot see any wisdom in prohibiting persons from soliciting for trusteeships. How are new trustees to be obtained if persons cannot solicit for business? In any case, one would not be bound to employ them. Compositions and assignments without sequestration, under part XI. of the bill, to some extent take the place of liquidation by arrangement and composition with creditors, as provided under parts IX. and X. of the old Queensland Insolvency Act. Part IX. of the latter section provides a convenient method of winding up a debtor&#39;s affairs without making him insolvent. It confers upon the creditors the absolute control of their meetings, and the right to appoint a receiver without any application to the court; the debtor&#39;s discharge is entirely at their discretion. Part X. provides that creditors of a debtor unable to pay his debts may, without any proceedings in insolvency, resolve that a composition shall be accepted in satisfaction of the debts due to them from the debtor. </para>

              <para>- I hope that the Minister will later deal with this subject, so that the people of Queensland may learn, through <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> that in his opinion the bill conforms with the Queensland act. This provision has been in operation in Queensland for years. It is a simple and easy method of enabling a debtor at small expense! to relieve himself from pressing liabilities. It also enables creditors to treat leniently a debtor towards whom they desire to show indulgence. It is a speedy, effective, and inexpensive procedure, and a similar provision should be included in the bill. Section 108 of the Queensland act, which is omitted from the bill, includes every transaction which was not made for a reasonable and sufficient consideration given . at the time. This provision has frequently been availed of by trustees. The principal provision of section 109 of the Queensland act, which we are also to lose, renders voidable any transaction which diminishes the property to be divided among the creditors. It also has been the means of recovering valuable assets for estates. It will be observed that clause 95 of the bill, for the voidance of preferences, applies only to creditors, and any person who is not a creditor but is a party to a fraudulent transfer of a pro.party, cannot be attacked. I have been informed by trustees of &#39; long standing, who have large staffs and a solicitor and a barrister at their command, that under the bill only preferences that are given to creditors can be attacked, and they consider that the bill should contain the Queensland provision allowing an attack on those who are not creditors. In a case of this kind in Warwick, &#163;4,000 was obtained for the creditors. In another case, in Gympie, &#163;2,000 was obtained. The insolvent transferred property to his family to defraud his creditors. Sections 108 and 109 of the Queensland act made it perfectly clear to the court that the trustees were entitled to these amounts. But under this bill I fear they would have been lost to the creditors. Sections 108 and 109 are preference provisions peculiar to Queensland, and have proved by experience to be very desirable. There is no provision in the bill for a minimum remuneration to a trustee on small troublesome estates. Of course, through the courts these estates can be wound up, but, as honorable members know, a government receiver has not the full information and time at his command that <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> trustee has - a man who obtains through the circulation of weekly gazettes particulars of all cases that have been before the courts, whether the District Court, the Supreme Court or the Petty Debtors Court. </para>

              <para>- I know of one trustee in Sydney, and two others in Brisbane, who receive full particulars of all cases before the courts. They know the best method of realizing a small estate. The payment of remuneration to a trustee by results is not justified by experience. Many estates are inherently impossible of good results, and they cannot be wound up fairly and justly under the system of payment by results. The good definition of proper books of account in the bill of 1912, that they shall contain a record of all goods bought, all goods sold, all cash received, and all cash paid, is&#39; omitted from the criminal clauses of the bill except that if a man has been insolvent before, or if he has previously called a meeting of his creditors, it is a criminal offence not to keep such records. Why should not a debtor be punished for failing to keep a proper record of his dealings ? </para>

            <para>- In Queensland, no attempt has been made to put such a man in gaol, but the effect of the act has been to make people very careful to keep reasonable accounts &#34;of their dealings. It is only fair and just that the Queensland provision should be included in the bill. Part XII. of the bill provides for assignments, but terms them deeds of arrangement. In Queensland, a debtor in financial difficulties may, with the consent of his creditors, execute a deed of assignment. A deed of assignment may be broadly defined as a contract in writing between the debtor, creditors, and the trustee, whereby the debtor agrees to assign the whole of his assets to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors. That is the most simple and convenient method for dealing with an estate, and releasing a debtor from his liabilities. It is very economical, the legal costs rarely exceeding one guinea. When a man has been proved to be honest, and severe floods or droughts have caused him to lose heavily, why should he not be allowed to assign his estate without the necessity for taking insolvency proceedings, which may leave a stain upon his character ? </para>

              <para>- Liquidation by arrangement, with its immediate control of the estate by the creditors, and absolute control for all time of the insolvent&#39;s discharge, is entirely cut out of this bill. The automatic stoppage of adverse proceedings by the appointment of a receiver will also be rendered impossible. A far greater hardship will be the prohibition of assignments for the benefit of creditor&#39;s who are outside the act. White&#39;s Mercantile Agency, a firm in Brisbane, has informed me that that plan has been carried out in the administration of fully 1,000 estates. Its elasticity and economy commend themselves to creditors so much that of late years it has become the method most frequently adopted in the winding-up of estates. The bill proposes to make that procedure a criminal offence. Why cannot creditors be allowed to manage their affairs in the manner which experience has shown to be the most advantageous? In the case of an unfortunate debtor, whose creditors are sympathetically inclined towards him, that practice combines a minimum of publicity and expense with a maximum dividend. It is naturally the most acceptable course to the debtor. The bill does not provide for the private examination of the bankrupt upon oath by the trustee. That is regarded as a most desirable proceeding, as a good deal of expense is thereby saved. If many of the Queensland provisions were included in the bill, a great deal of legal expense would thereby be saved, because judgments have been given upon the Queensland provisions by the higher courts, and there is not very much likelihood of those judgments being challenged. It is considered advisable that the examination of a bankrupt should take place before a special instead of a common jury. The special jury panel in Queensland has upon it men who possess business knowledge and experience. That is not the case with the common jury panel. A special jury would be as sympathetic as a common jury, but because of its knowledge of business and finance, it would be more likely to see that justice was done. The provision which gives to the ofiicial trustee the monopoly of estates of a value under &#163;300 is manifestly unfair and undesirable.In many cases it will be impossible to decide immediately whether an estate will be above or below that limit. Estates can be wound up much more economically, and with greater satisfaction to all parties, by an outside trustee. I have had several interviews with the acting AttorneyGeneral, and I trust that he will consider favorably my suggestion that we should continue to enjoy the provisions that we have so long enjoyed in Queensland. </para>

          <para>Mr.HURRY. - The Victorian insolvency law is more up to date than that of any other state. In 1915 it was codified by the present Acting Chief Justice of Victoria. As the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has said, some of the states have undoubtedly fallen down on. the job of codifying their insolvency laws because the Commonwealth proposed to introduce this measure. There can be only one answer to the question whether it is advisable to pass this bill. Every business man knows that it is absolutely necessary to have one bankruptcy or insolvency law throughout the whole of Australia. Consider the case of a resident of Mildura, Victoria. On the other side of the river, a few miles distant, is the town of Wentworth, and a little further on is the townof Renmark. If a man becomes insolvent in Mildura and is careless or dishonest, he can easily remove himself from the jurisdiction of the Victorian court. Suppose that one of his assets is a motor car. He can slip across the river to Wentworth, to which place the Victorian assignee or trustee would find it very difficult to follow him.  His  solicitor would inform him that the jurisdiction of the Victorian court does not extend to Wentworth, and it would be necessary to forward the matter to his agent in Sydney. The long arm of the law would reach out from Melbourne to Sydney, and back again to Wentworth. It might then be found that the man had escaped to Renmark, and proceedings would have to be commenced afresh. The Melbourne agent would have to communicate with Adelaide, from which city the long arm of the law could reach out to Renmark. If that can happen in an area embracing three towns that are only 100 miles apart, what could happen in the whole of Australia, which has a length of 4,000 miles by a breadth of 3,000 miles, and a coastline of 12,000 miles? The rights of debtors and creditors must be considered. If the debtor can make over to his creditors the assets to which he is entitled, and obtain his release, the method adopted will not make very much difference to him. The matter is entirely different, however, when considered from the point of view of the creditor. In addition to the ordinary insolvency provisions relating to small bankruptcies, there is Part XI., which deals with compositions and assignments without sequestration, and Part XII., which relates to deeds of arrangement. If the amendments forecast by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> are accepted, there will be two additional methods, dealing with liquidation by arrangement and composition of creditors. Ihave read over very carefully the proposals of the honorable member, and I think there is very little need for them, as those matters are adequately dealt with in Parts XI. and XII. There may be some slight details that it will be advantageous to adopt. I notice that the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> is to bring forward an amendment in relation to priorities which is designed to give special consideration to claims by carriers. I shall be interested to hear the honorable member in support of that proposal. I cannot see why a carrier should be given priority over practically everybody else. The honorable member may be able to put forward such a strong case that we shall be prevailed upon to assist him to have his amendment accepted. The summary administration in small bankruptcies provided for by clause 154 will prove beneficial. That clause provides - </para>

          <para class="block">The value of that provision will depend mainly upon what modifications are prescribed. I see no reason for the displace- ment of the official receiver by a trustee.

          <para>It will be of great advantage to have uniform legislation throughout Australia If we find that certain provisions of the measure do not work satisfactorily, we can amend them from time to time.

          <para>Insolvency jurisdiction in South Australia is vested, in the first instance, in a Commissioner of Insolvency, although there is the right of appeal to the Supreme Court from any decision of the Commissioner of Insolvency. But if the definition of &#34;The Court&#34; and clause 18 are agreed to, it seems to me that an important alteration of the existing practice in South Australia will have to be made, notwithstanding that it has been satisfactory since its establishment in 1886 - 38 years ago. I doubt very much whether the South Australian Government would agree to such an alteration. It would also be undesirable from the South Australian stand-point for the reason that there is not only considerable congestion of work in the Supreme Court of South Australia, but also very limited accommodation. Several years ago, a fourth judge was appointed in South Australia, but, in spite of that, all the judges have their hands full. The accommodation in the Supreme Court building is so limited that sometimes cases have to be heard in chambers instead of in the court rooms, which causes considerable inconvenience to every one concerned. If we agree to this definition and to clause 18, one of two alternatives will have to be faced. Either the South Australian Government will have to appoint another judge, or give to the pre- sent Commissioner of Insolvency the status of a judge of the Supreme Court, which I do not think it would do, or else the Commonwealth Government will have to appoint a judge to deal with the insolvency work in that state, which will mean incurring considerable expense. I suggest to the Minister that an amendment be made to the definition and to clause 18, to provide that where the insolvency work is at present being done by a Commissioner of Insolvency, as in South Australia, that practice may be continued. </para>

            <para>. - Our constitutional power to delegate judicial authority is limited, for we can transfer it only to a court and not to a person. If the Commissioner of Insolvency in South Australia presides over a properlyconstituted court, as I believe he does, no difficulties will arise from the passing of this legislation. In New South Wales there is a Registrar of Bankruptcy and a Bankruptcy Court. So long as there is a recognized court to which we can delegate judicial authority no difficulties will arise. </para>

              <para>- That is so, but I am afraid that the passing of this measure will place a good deal more work on the judges than they are obliged to do under the state acts, and this Parliament should make up its mind now whether it is willing, if the need should arise, to appoint additional judges to do this work, in the event of the state judges refusing to do it. I shall be glad if the Minister can give me an assurance that the passing of this bill will not mean the incurring of considerably greater expense without compensating benefits to the people. I can see very little hope of obtaining any help from the judges of the Victorian Supreme Court in administering the measure. </para>

If the proposal made by the honorable member for Boothby, to place the administration of at least parts of the proposed uniform bankruptcy law on commissioners or registrars could be adopted, it would be a good thing. No doubt, honorable members know that the Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court deals with quite a lot of business which only needs to be placed before the judges of the court for ratification. If that custom could be introduced into our bankruptcy laws, it would be advantageous. </para>

            <para>. - Clause 18 provides that the jurisdiction in bankruptcy may be vested in such one or more judges of a state court as the Governor-General, with the concurrence of the Governor of the state, appoints for that purpose. In New South Wales, at present, a judge of the Supreme Court has jurisdiction in bankruptcy, but district court judges and certain magistrates also have certain bankruptcy jurisdiction. Nothing in clause 18 will prevent that practice from being continued. It is thought better to confine it to the judges of the different courts rather than take in outsiders and make additional judicial appointments. A great deal of the work will still be done in the same way as hitherto, and the commissioners and registrars will have certain judicial powers conferred on them; but so far as the jurisdiction of the courts is concerned, it is thought desirable that there should be uniformity throughout the Commonwealth, and that the jurisdiction should not be vested in a commissioner in one state and in a judge in another state. We have adopted the principle of vesting it in the judges, so that there may be uniformity throughout the states. </para>

            <para>.- I am not satisfied of the necessity for this office. The clause is quite foreign to the operation of the state acts. The justification for it - so far as there is justification - is that this will be a Com- monwealth act, operated from a central department - the department of the Commonwealth Attorney-General. I point out that its being operated from that central department gives it a federal centre, and a federal home. The appointment of an inspector-general involves the appointment of other officers also, and the establishment of an inspector-general&#39;s department. I cannot see that that is necessary. As we proceed with the bill, it will be seen that we have registrars in each of the states, and the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> has just pointed out that, in South Australia, we have a Commissioner of Insolvency. In all the states we have the necessary machinery for operating the act. The position of inspector-general is merely that of a picturesque figure-head. The nexus between the Commonwealth and the states is provided by the AttorneyGeneral in his official capacity. On the information at present available, I am opposed to the creation of this office. </para>

            <para>. - The InspectorGeneral in Bankruptcy will be responsible, under the Attorney-General, for the administration of the act, and for securing uniformity throughout the states. In view of the fact that this act will apply throughout the Commonwealth, and that in the several states differing systems are at present in operation, it is necessary that we should have one officer who shall be responsible, under the Commonwealth Attorney-General, for the proper administration of the act. It would be impossible for the Attorney-General to do the whole of this work. The officers of the department consider that proper and uniform administration can best be achieved along the lines suggested in this bill, and have suggested that this office should be created. </para>

            <para>.- I can see in this clause the possibility of another department being superimposed on the six departments now existing in the various states. I do not wish to overwork any member of the legal profession, but from time to time appointments have been made to tie Attorney-General&#39;s department to assist the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General with their work. If an inspector-general is appointed, he will gather round him a number of other officers, and soon we shall have another Commonwealth department. If uniformity is so desirable, it can best be obtained by giving to this Parliament those powers that it should possess. If this bill is passed, will it supersede all other bankruptcy laws throughout Australia, or will they be superseded only to the extent that they conflict with it? If we are to have both state and federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws, there will be seven such acts to be administered throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

If not, it means that we shall have six states, as well as the Commonwealth, administering bankruptcy and insolvency laws.

Whatever duties it is proposed to allot to the inspector-general could, and should, be performed by the AttorneyGeneral. The clause gives no idea as to the nature of these duties. Honorable members do not know whether the officer is to be located in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, or whether he will visit the various states in a supervisory capacity. In any case, it means the creation of another unnecessary office carrying a high salary. </para>

The administration of the bankruptcy laws throughout Australia is a going concern. The courts are working according to the laws of the various states, and on the whole they are operating fairly satisfactorily, except for difficulties and differences of the kind mentioned this afternoon by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hurry).</inline> These anomalies are quite sufficient to warrant a Commonwealth bankruptcy law, but it is not intended that the bill should create a revolution in the working of the existing statutes. When this bill has been passed, the state courts will continue on much the same lines as have been adopted in the past. </para>

              <para>- The courts in the various states will adhere to the existing procedure, as far as it is not inconsistent with this measure. That is my answer to the contention of the Minister that the appointment of an inspectorgeneral is necessary to create some kind of artificial harmony amongst the states. There will be no lack of harmony, although there may well be a difference in procedure. The less this bill interferes with existing machinery, the more efficacious it will be. </para>

              <para>- No. From his high-sounding title, I take it that he will receive a considerable salary, but I have never known an appointment of this kind to be authorized without the duties being set out in a general way. All we know about the duties of this officer is contained in the one and a half lines of the clause under consideration, which states that his duties are to be &#34; as are prescribed.&#34; In all the states there are registrars of insolvency, and provision is made for the appointment of trustees and official receivers. Generally there is provision for all the local requirements in connexion with insolvency matters, and I see no necessity to make a special appointment of an inspector-general to supervise the operation of the insolvency law. I am afraid that this officer will be a source, not of harmony, but of discord. Furthermore, there is a fundamental objection to the appointment of a person who will receive a high salary, and gradually gather about him a staff of officials which from no point of view is necessary. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> expressed some anxiety on this account. There will be good grounds for the honorable member&#39;s apprehension if we set out by providing for the appointment of such an officer as the proposed inspector-general.  I appeal to the committee not to entertain the proposal for a moment, unless the duties of the inspectorgeneral are set out in the bill. Can honorable members point to any act in which provision is made for the appointment of a highly-paid officer that does not, at least in general terms, set out the duties he is to perform ? I suggest that the reason why the duties of this officer are not set out in this bill is that the Government does not know what they will be. There, no doubt, is a confident belief that if such an officer is appointed he will create duties for himself, and will recommend the appointment of a staff. In my view, such an officer would merely interfere with the proper operation of the measure. I can imagine none but a sentimental reason for the proposed appointment. We have certainly heard no reason from the Minister for Defence. To say, as the honorable gentleman has done, that the appointment is necessary to harmonize the procedure under the act in the different states, is an absurdity. </para>

              <para>- The bill provides that it is to be administered through districts proclaimed, without regard to state boundaries. I should like to see the bill passed into law; but I do not wish to see its successful operation endangered by the appointment of an unnecessary and, perhaps, an interfering official. The less interference there is with the present operation of the bankruptcy laws in Australia the better. Should there be occasion to invoke the aid of a superior federal tribunal, the proper tribunal to refer to is the AttorneyGeneral, and- the staff of the Federal Crown Law Offices. The AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department possesses ample machinery to deal with such a matter. </para>

            <para>.- I trust that the Minister will give some better explanation for the proposed appointment of an inspector-general under this bill than he has so far given. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has pointed out that the duties of the proposed ^official are not defined in the bill. It appears to me that two-thirds of the time of the present Government is spent in trying to find jobs for its friends. In this bill we have another highly-paid office created for some one who wants a job, or must be placated. In consenting to the appointment of useless officials, honorable members forget that their greatest trust is the proper control of the finances of the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Batman has pointed out that other measures providing for similar appointments Bet out, at least in outline, the duties of the officers appointed under them. I say, further, that in measures creating positions of this kind, it is usual also for the&#39; salary of the proposed officer to be stated. </para>

              <para>- Then a similar mistake was made in providing for his appointment, but the Minister will not contend that the position of the proposed inspector-general under this bill will be  analogous to that of the ComptrollerGeneral of Customs. I have no wish to prevent the speedy passage of this bill, but I am not prepared to vote to create this office until I am shown that there is a necessity for it. The honorable member for Batman has shown that it is unnecessary, and his contention has not been replied to. If honorable members agree to the proposed appointment their action will be quoted as a precedent for providing for a similar appointment in some other bill. I hope the committee will negative the clause. </para>

            <para>.- I maintain that this clause proposes the creation of a new department. An inspectorgeneral of police has absolute control of the force, and is in charge of a department. An inspector-general of lunacy is also in charge of a department and has a staff of officials under his control. All these inspectors-general are practically in charge of departments. I am always anxious to prevent the creation of new departments. I have confidence that those in charge of the Crown Law Offices of the Commonwealth will be able to administer this measure, and there is no necessity for the appointment of a highly-paid official who will soon surround himself with a departmental staff. We often see complaints in the press concerning the enormous Public Service of the Commonwealth in view of the comparatively small population of Australia, and there is much justification for those complaints. We have no evidence that the proposed inspector-general will have any duties whatever to perform. I can quite understand that the Government has not given this bill the critical consideration which it&#39; is the duty of the Opposition to give it, and has perhaps overlooked this provision for the appointment of a superfluous officer. The bill would be better without it, and I trust that the Minister will see the wisdom of permitting the clause to be negatived. </para>

            <para>.-  I think the Minister in charge of the bill would be well advised to postpone this clause until he is able to tell the committee what will be the duties of theinspectorgeneral. I listened to the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> when, some weeks ago, he moved the second reading of this bill, and I listened this afternoon to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> . I have been under the impression, from what they have said, that the object of the measure is to co-ordinate existing bankruptcy laws, and not to set up new machinery for their administration. If the intention is to create new machinery, other offices besides that of an inspector-general will have to be provided for. It is extraordinary that provision should be made for the appointment of an inspectorgeneral without one. word in the bill to say what are to be his duties. The Minister said that the same practice was followed in the appointment of the ComptrollerGeneral of Customs. </para>

              <para>- The salary, after all, is a comparatively minor question, although it is important. Surely&#39; before the committee is asked to sanction the appointment of an officer it should be told what his duties will be. The duties of the ComptrollerGeneral of Customs are set out in several clauses of the Customs Act. Will the proposed inspector-general, have powers of delegation ? Will he be subject entirely to the Attorney-General? For how long will he be appointed? What will be his salary ? No information on these points is given for the guidance of the committee. Honorable members are asked to shut their eyes, open their mouths, and see what the Lord will send them. The Minister, by refusing to give the required information, is forcing members of the Opposition to vote against the clause. We have not shown any disposition to impede the progress of the bill. For seventeen years it has been pursuing the long trail, and if we can expedite its passage we shall be pleased to do so. I am satisfied that it is a necessary bill, but I cannot see the need for the proposed appointment. When co-ordinating the laws of the Commonwealth it seems to be a habit of the Government to create new offices. That is a wrong practice, unless the necessity for the appointments can be shown. I suggest that the clause be postponed until further information is available. </para>

Clause 12 provides that the GovernorGeneral may proclaim districts, in each of which will be a registrar. Clause 24 sets out the duties of the registrars. It does not make much difference what we call this new officer. If we call him a, &#34;chief registrar&#34; the difficulty disappears. He will really perform the duties of a chief registrar. Some one will have to co-ordinate the duties of the district registrars, and it does not matter whether we call him an inspector-general or a chief registrar. </para>

            <para>.- If the bill becomes the bankruptcy law of Australia and supersedes the state acts, regulations must be issued. Every registrar, receiver, and official employed in connexion with insolvency and bankruptcy must conform to those regulations. Is it to be assumed that the registrars, deputy registrars, and other officers in bankruptcy will not be able to understand and obey the regulations? What necessity is there for appointing a man to meander all over Australia, unless it is to create a certain amount of irritation ? The Solicitor-General, or an officer appointed by him, could meet the state officers in conference, and thus obviate the need for the proposed appointment. To superimpose upon the machinery of administration a highly-paid officer is absurd, and there is a great danger that he will collect round him a staff of subordinate officers. His appointment will be practically a charter to form a new department. Unless the states have been employing a large number of inefficient officers, the proposed new regulations will be interpreted and enforced without difficulty. The chief officer of the insolvency and county courts exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction in Victoria is the chief clerk, who is appointed by the Governor in Council. The position is analogous to that of registrar in bankruptcy in England or New South Wales. Even in Great Britain, where there is a population of 45,000,000, there is not an inspector-general to instruct the registrars. </para>

The GovernorGeneral may not necessarily direct that a judge of the state court shall officiate. In other words, while the Governor-General may appoint a judge of the Supreme Court, he may not do so, and in such case the official who administers this work will still continue to do so. I should like to have an assurance from the Minister as to whether the position is as I have indicated, and whether the clause does not necessarily prevent the present commissioner in South Australia from carrying out his duties in that state. </para>

        <para class="block">If that amendment is agreed to, I shall then propose that the time limitation also be struck out. The claim of a working man on what is known as &#34; the bread line &#34; to have priority for his wages in the application of the estate of a bankrupt is unanswerable, and there should be no limitation as to time or amount. There are many circumstances in which a workman may be prevailed upon, in the interests of an undertaking, to work either for no wages or for a reduced wage. If the employer becomes bankrupt, men dependent upon their wages for their means of living should be considered without regard to either the amount or the time during which the wages were due to them. </para>

          <para>. - I am afraid the amendment would defeat what the honorable member desires to accomplish. The limitation of &#163;50, and of the period to four months, is more likely to safeguard the interest of the wage-earner than the amendment. If there is no limitation either as to the amount or the time, men on a salary, and above what is generally regarded as the bread line, may draw  hundreds of pounds owing to them and share equally with wage-earners drawing lesser amounts. The limitation has been inserted to ensure that the working man,, as we know him, shall get what is due to him. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The bill makes provision for preference in respect of wages, of rates levied by local governing authorities, and also of rent. The agent, in my opinion, should also be considered. Let us consider the case of a country storekeeper who instructs his agent to take delivery of goods from an incoming vessel. The agent may be called upon to pay duty, freight, and landing charges. In due time the goods may be received by the storekeeper and taken into stock, but owing to financial stress the storekeeper may be declared insolvent. Under the law as it stands at present the agent ranks as an ordinary creditor. If the goods had remained on the wharf the official trustee would certainly have been obliged to pay out of the estate all the charges that were met by the agent. I agree that amounts owing as wages are rightly included as a preference claim, and, to a lesser extent, rent also. I contend that the cash outlay of an agent should take preference over rates levied by a local governing authority. An agent is not in quite the same position as an ordinary business man supplying goods upon which he expects to make a profit. It is quite true that he receives a commission for the performance of certain duties, but frequently his work involves him in payment of cash out of pocket, for which he is legitimately entitled to preference. I submit this amendment on behalf of the Master Carriers Federal Council of Australia, which recently assembled in conference at Brisbane. </para>

          <para>. -  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment, as it would widen the scope of the bill too much. &#187; An agent takes the ordinary business, trade risks, and should rank with other creditors. There is no reason why an agent should be secured in his out-of-pocket expenses any more than the man who supplies goods, or the solicitor who pays fees on  a  legal document. </para>

        <para class="block">This sub-clause provides that where a debt has been proved and where any claim is made for interest, the interest consideration shall be calculated at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum, without prejudice to the right of a creditor to receive out of the estate any higher rate of interest to which he may be entitled after all the debts proved in the estate have been paid in full. The interest provision is, in my opinion, a very liberal one. Most creditors would be delighted to receive payment of the amount owing without interest. When this clause was before the committee of another place an honorable senator sought to reduce the rate of interest to 6 per cent., but the Government resisted the amount. The creditor is very often a money lender. Most creditors would consider themselves extremely fortunate if they could recover the whole amount of debt with interest at the rate of 6 per cent. </para>

          <para>. -  The limitation on the rate has been inserted to prevent excessive claims on account of interest. In some instances the claim has been as high as 100 per cent. The recognized rate now is 8 per cent. The Government is paying 6| per cent, for its money, and the banks usually get 8 per cent, for overdrafts. In the circumstances the amount provided in the clause may be considered reasonable. </para>

        <para class="block">We should safeguard the interests of the creditors if anybody other than a creditor receives preference. Under sections 108 and 109 of the Queensland act, if a person other than a creditor receives preference, action can be taken to compel him to divulge the whole of his transactions with the insolvent, and property which he has received can be recovered for the benefit of the creditors. In Warwick, a trustee was able, by means of this provision, to recover &#163;4,000; and in Gympie, another trustee secured for the creditors an additional &#163;2,000. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendment. The Queensland Chambers of Commerce, representing the commercial community, are very anxious that the provisions of sections 10S and 109 of the Queensland act shall be included in this bill. It is contended that clause 95 of the bill is insufficient, as it does not include the provisions contained in section 108 of the Queensland act, for attacking any transaction that is not made for a reasonable and sufficient consideration given at the time ; nor does it include the provision contained in section 109 of the Queensland act, which makes voidable any action that diminishes the property to be divided amongst the creditors. It appears to the Queensland Chambers of Commerce that clause 95 is meant to apply only to creditors, and that any person other than a creditor cannot be attacked for taking part in a fraudulent transaction. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. The vital words in the Queensland section that we have not adopted are &#34; diminish the property to be divided amongst the creditors.&#34; I think they have too wide an application. Any conveyance or transfer of property to any person within six months ofthe date of the bankruptcy, which would have the effect of diminishing the amount of money to be divided among the creditors, may, under the Queensland provision, be rendered void. There was a case in Queensland which turned upon those words. A property was sold for &#163;1,500, but somebody valued it at &#163;1,650, and the transfer was declared void because the amount of property which went to the creditors had thus been &#34; diminished.&#34; I can quite understand a man who is in urgent need of cash offering to accept &#163;1,200 for a property upon which he places a value of &#163;1,500. If he becomes insolvent within six months of that transaction, it can be rendered void under the Queensland provision unless the purchaser could prove the bona fides of the transaction. </para>

          <para>.- Surely a most vindictive penalty is proposed to be inflicted ! The clause provides that if any person, knowing that any property is liable to seizure does any act to hinder the seizure of that property he shall be guilty of an indictable offence and be subject to a penalty of imprisonment for three years. I suggest that it would not be a case of making the punishment fit the crime. A great many persons in the community are liable to a fine of &#163;10 or &#163;20 and imprisonment for one month, with the option of a further monetary penalty, for offences which . 1 consider are graver than would be that of an unfortunate bankrupt who failed to deliver up certain of his property.

            <para>-  This clause refers to the remuneration of the trustee appointed to administer an estate. Let us suppose that a storekeeper, through no fault of his own, but through adverse seasons, is unable toobtain payment from his debtors, and that he asks for an advance from his creditors. The creditors meet together and decide to give him an extension of time on the condition that a trustee is appointed to carry on the business at a remuneration of 1 per cent, on the turnover. Later, the storekeeper is able to meet his obligations. In that case there is no act of insolvency. Under the bill there is no power to appoint any trustee to look after a business that is being carried on in the interest of the debtor and his creditors. I know of cases where estates in this way have been retained by the debtors, who, through reasonable time being allowed them, have been able to carry on their affairs and pay 20s. in the &#163;1. </para>

          <para>. - I suggest that this clause be left out, for I see no objection to allowing solicitation for trusteeships. In a large state like Queensland, it would be difficult and expensive to send trustees to outlying parts. Creditors would not be bound to accept as trustees any persons who might solicit appointment, but there is no reason why a young man, who might be thoroughly capable but yet not well known, should be denied the right to seek new business. </para>

        <para class="block">The clause is an extension of that provision, and it is strongly opposed in South Australia, the one state in which a somewhat similar provision is in operation. I suggest, therefore, that it should be eliminated. There does not appear, either, to be any&#39; reason why the powers of the trustee should be restricted in the way proposed. He is likely to be a reputable person who will safeguard the interests of the creditors. Clause 126 makes provision for his appointment by the court, and the court has power, not only to appoint him, but to cancel his registration, I point out, further, that this clause contains a proviso which makes the matter much worse, and does not appear in the South Australian act. That proviso is contained in the words in the centre of the clause -  nor until the assents required for the validity of the deed have been obtained. </para>

            <para>- I prefer that the whole clause should be eliminated ; but, if the Minister is not prepared to agree to that, the amendment he suggests would be some improvement upon the clause. It should be obvious to the committee that under this clause, read in conjunction with clause 163, it is possible that a trustee might not be able to sell a property within a month in the case of creditors resident in Australia, or within six months in the case of creditors resident outside Australia. That would defeat the whole purpose of the clause, which is to provide that the property of the debtor shall be realizable as quickly as possible. It is further to- be noted that provisions somewhat similar to those in clause 163  <inline font-style="italic">ri</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> are included in the South Australian act. If honorable members will look up the South Australian act, or will accept my assurance, I tell them that, under that act, the trustee has power to sell at any&#187;time after the expiration of ten days, whereas under this bill he might not be able to sell, in some cases, within a period of less than six months. </para>

          <para>.- I have received a communication from a very reputable public accountant in my electorate, who acts as trustee in a great many cases of bankruptcy. He states that if the amendmentof the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> is agreed to, the result will be that accountants will refuse to undertake trusteeships. He points out that if the commission is based on the net amount realized by the trustee, it will mean that in many cases he will receive practically no remuneration for his services. This will apply, particularly, where the trustee is compelled to resort to litigation, and where the whole of the proceeds of the sale of the assets are absorbed in legal expenses. The trustee&#39;s remuneration, he contends, should be left as it is, that is to say, the commission should be based on the gross receipts. This also applies to the case where the trustee carries on the business of the debtor with the consent of the creditors. One per cent. on the turnover of the capital of a business, he holds, is absurd, and may mean nothing to the trustee. As a matter cf fact, in most insolvent estates, there is no capital, for otherwise they would not be insolvent. The Queensland act leaves this matter in the hands of the creditors. Usually the trustee gets from1&#188; to1&#189; per cent, of the gross sales of the business, and he thinks that that basis should not be altered. The Queensland act covers the ground adequately in this respect, and does not require altering. I contend that the trustee&#39;s remuneration should be left entirely in the hands of the creditors, as is done in Queensland and England. According to Pixley, an authority on accountancy, the English bankruptcy rules of 1886 do not restrict the amount of commission paid to the trustees in insolvency. The commission is generally based on the amount realized, and, in addition to that, a percentage is usually allowed on the amount distributed in dividends. I bring this matter forward because the gentleman who wrote to me is a wellknown authority on bankruptcy matters in Central Queensland, and acts frequently as a trustee. </para>

          <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment. As will be seen, the penalty provided is imprisonment for one year. Such apunishment might not be excessive for one who had previously been insolvent, but would be unnecessarily harsh on a person who had not previously been before the court. Provision is made elsewhere for the punishment of a bankrupt who has been guilty of an offence by declining to issue a certificate of discharge. </para>

          <para>.- It is provided in sub-clause 1 that if a bankrupt brings about or contributes to his bankruptcy by gambling or by unjustifiable speculation unconnected with his trade or business, he shall be guilty of an offence, for which he is liable to be imprisoned for twelve months. A person may have no wilful intention of defrauding his creditors, but at the same time may, as the result of speculation which he considers justifiable, become bankrupt. </para>

          <para>.- I agree that there is much in the objection raised by the honorable member for East Sydney. The clause is curiously worded. Ordinary speculation, such as mild betting on horse races, in which a normal man may indulge, might be followed by bankruptcy due to other contributing causes, but such gambling or speculation might be regarded as a contributory cause, and render him liable to twelve months&#39; imprisonment. The penalty is too. severe. </para>
