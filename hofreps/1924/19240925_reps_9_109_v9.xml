                            <para>- In common with other honorable members on this side, I am very far from desiring that the cession should close at an early date, and I am aware that, under the Standing Orders which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> so strictly - and, if I may be allowed to say it, so ably interprets - I may not ask a question arising out of an answer given to another honorable member. But, in a speech made by the Prime Minister recently - for the purpose of identification, I may say that in it lie spoke of blackmailers, cut-throats, sectionists,  and other undesirables; the right honorable gentleman will remember the speech - he stated that the session was likely to close when the measures appearing on the notice-paper, with the exception of certain minor measures, were disposed of. Having regard to the fact that, in the process of debate, minor measures may develop into major measures, I  should  be glad if the right honorable gentleman would inform the House which are the minor measures on the paper that are likely to be jettisoned before the session closes? </para>

Indeed, I cannot remember making any speech in which I referred to the work which has to be done before the session closes. As the honorable gentleman has asked what are the measures with which it is not intended to proceed, I shall take an opportunity at an early date to inform the House what are the proposals of the Government. </para>

Those of us who come to Parliament House between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning are compelled to swallow quantities of dust stirred up by the sweeping pf the cleaning staff, which uses the most antiquated carpet appliances, so that as much dust arises as goes into the sweepers. I wish to ask whether better methods might not be adopted, including, if necessary, the laying down of rubber carpets. </para>

Therefore, I ask the right honorable gentleman, Who was the first Leader of this party that has saved the honour and prestige of Australia? What recognition has the Nationalist party made of his great services? What has become of him ? Is not to-day his birthday, and what does the Government propose to do to recognize his past services? </para>

The Government has not come to a decision about the sugar embargo. As the embargo will continue until next year, I do not think it is likely that an announcement will be made before the House rises, but the Government's decision will be made known in ample time to enable those interested in the industry to know exactly where they stand. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Public Works Committee has already investigated and reported to Parliament concerning the main outfall sewer at Canberra, the main intercepting sewer within the city boundary, and the main serving the southern portion of the city. The time has now' come when consideration should be given to the construction of the branch to serve the north-eastern portion of the city. The present proposal comprises the construction of a main sewer leading northwards from the junction of the southern and main intercepting sewers on Commonwealthavenue, across the Molonglo River, and extending eastwards as far as Prospect-parkway. At the present time, this district is served by local treatment works, the reticulation thereto being so arranged that it may easily be connected with the proposed sewer when constructed. The population on the northern side of the city is increasing. With the advent of private enterprise and the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, the present works will be inadequate to meet the demand, and it will be necessary to connect the service with the main city sewerage scheme. The proposed development is in general conformity with the scheme submitted by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in its first general report. A plan indicating the proposed route of the sewer is submitted herewith. This sewer will be laid in the form of precast concrete pipes of similar construction to those used for the southern intercepting sewer. The estimated cost of the proposed northern main sewer is £82,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">The gravitation, sewerage scheme adopted for the Federal Capital involves the construction of works at the' outfall to treat the sewage, in order that an innocuous effluent may he obtained for discharge into the Molonglo River. In 1915, the Public Works Committee, when considering the general sewerage scheme for Canberra, and approving of the main outfall sewer, suggested that "prior to the date on which it is proposed to erect treatment tanks, exhaustive inquiries be made, with a view to the installation of the most up-to-date system then obtainable." Since that time, methods of sewage disposal have been the subject of close investigation by experts in various parts of the world, and the results of these experiments, and the conclusions arrived at by leading authorities were carefully reviewed, before a method of treatment for the Federal Capital was adopted by the technical advisers of the Government. In Order that the sewerage scheme may be in operation by the time Parliament is transferred to Canberra, it is necessary that preliminary action should now be taken iii connexion with the treatment works, and accordingly a scheme has been formulated for reference to the Public Works: .Committee. The scheme provides for- the installation of a first unit of sedimentation tanks and trickling . filters to deal with 500,000 gallons daily, being the sewage from 5,000 people, plus the flushing water necessary for scouring the sewers in the initial stages, and for the installation of a small experimental unit capable of treating the sewage of 500 people by the activated sludge method, so arranged that either crude sewage or settled sewage from the sedimentation tanks can be passed through it. The present proposal provides for these units to be increased, as necessity arises, to treat the sewage of 10,000, and, later, of 25,000 people. It is designed to provide for immediate requirements at a minimum of cost, and at the same time offer possibilities of developing alternatives at a later date, after experience of Canberra conditions has supplied the necessary local data on which to form a definite opinion as to the direction in which future expansion should be made. I lay upon the table a plan showing the general locality of the works, and an outline of the pro- posed scheme. The estimated cost of treatment works to provide for 25,000 people is £60,000, of which, it is anticipated, £37,000 would be expended within the next three years. </para>

                        <para>.- Proposed expenditure of this kind must be governed by the probable influx of population into Canberra. We have been told that a big city will grow there, and that as soon as the land is thrown open for selection many people will take up residential and business blocks. So far no attempt has been made to make the land available for selection, and population cannot go there until that is done. We were assured that the first sale of leases would be held in September or October, but it has been further postponed. </para>

                    <para>.- By introducing such measures as this, the Government seems to be dealing piecemeal with our various industries, without any attempt to organize them at all. If our primary industries are to flourish, we must in a few years take uniform and comprehensive action to deal with Australian products, and to obtain markets for them overseas. I shall quote a few figures respecting the importation of currants into Britain. Last year the currants imported into Britain from Australia amounted to 77,000 cwt., valued at £278, 000, and from other countries, 967,000 cwt., valued at £3,000,000. Other dried fruits imported into Britain from Australia amounted to 102,000 cwt., valued at £483,000, and from other countries, 1,312,000 cwt., valued at £5,714,000. These figures show that there is a splendid market in Britain itself for Australian dried fruits. I believe that the scheme outlined in the bill, if put into operation, will be of some benefit to the producers, but assistance will be needed in other directions if their industry is to flourish at all. I have been greatly impressed with speeches recently delivered on this subject by party leaders in the British House of Commons. They seem to be unanimous that something must be done by way of organization to bring about the satisfactory marketing of the products of the dominions in Britain itself. The Secretary of State for the Colonies <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thomas),</inline> following in the footsteps of his predecessor, is strongly in favour of this. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> when introducing the bill, mentioned the Imperial Economic Committee that had been appointed by the Imperial Conference. I believe that committee was established to encourage trade within the Empire. The ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baldwin)</inline> made a most important proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philip</inline> Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when delivering his budget speech recently, referred to that proposal as one certainly of the most drastic character. A number of honorable members in this chamber would disapprove of it, but I am inclined to support it, because we should do everything possible to bring about a better trade understanding between Great Britain and the dominions. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> when dealing with this subject, said - </para>

                    <para>It is unfair to adopt the policy that, unfortunately, has been adopted in the past, of assuming that on these Empire questions one party alone is the patriotic party. It is not true. We resent it, and we shall be able to prove that it is not true. Equally we are prepared outside these fiscal controversies to consider every question without party bias or prejudice. </para>

                    spoke in a similar strain, and said that the people of Great Britain had a perfect right to decide their own fiscal issues in the same way as the dominions had the right to settle their own domestic affairs. I shall now refer to the proposition submitted by

                    still stands that Great Britain should be prepared to take produce from Australia.

Although the Australian proposal for inter-imperial preference made at the meeting of the economic committee of the Imperial Conference was objected to by Canada, it seems to me that when the leaders of the various political parties in England are favorable to something of that character being done, it should be possible to do it.

                        <para>- I should also like to know by what method the Government proposes to compile the roll of fruit-growers for the purpose of taking the poll. A number of fruit-growers in South Australia, some of whom are in the Adelaide hills district, are not members of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, and they should not be overlooked. While I agree that it is highly desirable for all the growers to be members of the organization, provision should be made for those who are outside of it to exercise a vote on this scheme. I intend subsequently to move for the insertion of some provisions which will meet the difficulties created by the outsiders. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see why the Western Australian growers should not be equally content with the proposal in the bill. In my opinion, the board is already too large. We keep piling these boards one on top of another, and during the past two or three years an enormous number of them has been created. I am more inclined to reduce than to increase the size and number of boards. If the growers, whose interests are identical all over Australia, are not satisfied with a majority decision, they cannot be satisfied with anything. There is no reason why state boundaries should be considered at all. The growers might prefer to elect three men from one state, and it may be assumed that if they did so, they would have every confidence in their representatives. The effect of the amendment will be to add one more member to a board that is already too large. </para>

                    <para>. -  Personally, I agree with the view of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that it is undesirable to increase the size of the board. The number of members of such boards should be restricted as much as possible. There is, however, a great difficulty in arranging the personnel of this board. It is imperative that the growers should have confidence in it. The dried fruits areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia' adjoin one another, and are situated mainly in the Murray River valley. There is no doubt that representatives elected by the growers in those areas would have their confidence. Western Australia is in a somewhat different category. While I agree with the principle of electing representatives of the whole industry, I can appreciate the argument that the Western Australian growers will have more confidence in the board if one of its members is elected by them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that there is any serious possibility of such a conflict. As a general principle, I am opposed to recognizing state boundaries, but in view of the peculiar circumstances of Western Australia, the Government is prepared to accept the amendment. The three representatives of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia will not be elected one from each of those states; they will be elected by the growers in those three states as one body. There is another argument that can be advanced in favour of the amendment. To give the growers a fourth representative will give them a majority of representatives on the board. That was not provided for in the first instance, because it was felt desirable to keep the size of the board as small as possible. As the bill is a purely marketing proposition, and as a considerable sum of Government money will be involved, it is necessary, in the interests of the producers, to have on the board men who have an intimate knowledge and a wide experience of the marketing of this product. </para>

                <para>As the bill now stands, both these representatives will be selected by the Government. The reason for this is probably that it was thought that if their appointment was left to the growers persons might be appointed who, although they might be experienced in the growing of fruit, might have little or no knowledge of marketing it. I think it would be better to provide for the nomination of persons for appointment to the board by the growers, and leave with the Government the discretion to select from the nominees those believed to be most suitable. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the clause is to ensure that one of the members of the board, with commercial experience, shall be a person acceptable to the growers He will, under the clause, be really a nominee of the growers. The only way in which this could be carried into effect would be by consultation with the Australian Dried Fruits Association. I can assure the honorable member that the Government has no intention of appointing to the board members with commercial experience without consultation with the representative body of the dried fruit growers. Before any appointments are made it will consult with the association. I, therefore, think that the amendment which the honorable member has suggested is unnecessary. </para>

Under this proviso the Government of the day, on the recommendation of a majority of the board, might remove any member, or any smaller number of members than the majority, from office.

The Governor-General should have the power to remove a member of the board from office. Such action would not be taken except in very extreme circumstances, but extreme circumstances might arise in which it would be advisable to remove a member. The use of the words " on the recommendation of the board," might be regarded as an invitation to the board to try to get rid of a member obnoxious to the majority, but there should be power left with the Governor-General to remove from office an objectionable person. </para>

Four of the members of the board will be elected by the growers as a whole, one will be appointed by the Government, and two will be appointed by the Government in consultation with those engaged in the industry. We must assume that a board of that character would not dream of exercising the power of recommending the removal of a member from office except in very extreme circumstances, or unless it were necessary to enable the board to carry out its duties under the act. As the final decision will rest with 'the Governor-General, I think the honorable member may be sure that there is not likely to be any abuse of the power contained in the proviso to which he has taken exception. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the honorable member for Kooyong will not persist in his amendment. Most of the objections that have been taken to the clause as it stands are based on theoretical grounds. It is possible, but it is not within the bounds of probability, that what has been mentioned as likely to occur will ever happen. If the suggestion of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> were adopted, it would mean, as the Prime Minister said, that if a member of the board who was particularly active made himself a nuisance to the Government, it could remove him. </para>

                    <para>.- No. The Government has given a good deal of consideration to this subject and has come to the conclusion that, as the board represents the producers, and will be financed with the producers' money, it is really for them to determine what fees shall be paid to the board. It is impossible to predict what the producers will desire the board to receive by way of fees and expenses. One suggestion considered by the Government was that the fees should be determined by the board itself. There is something to be said in favour of that, for the board will consist of the elected representatives of the producers, and should be able to give expression to their views. The Government, however, saw great objection to allowing the board to fix its own fees, and consequently decided that the fees and expenses should be prescribed. After the board has been appointed it can consider how often it will have to meet, and what fees it thinks should be paid. If the amount is reasonable I have no doubt that the Government will accept it and prescribe it. When the board has been in existence for some time, its members will be subject to the will of their masters, the producers, but in the first place the Government, acting in the interests of the producers, intends to see that nothing unreasonable is done. </para>

                    <para>. -  I see nothing in the clause to make the keeping of a full record of the proceedings of the board compulsory, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that a sub-clause be added to provide for it. It may not be essential, but it seems to me that, where a board is appointed to carry out the provisions of an act of Parliament, a true record of its proceedings should be kept. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think it would be as well to retain the quorum of three. Although the personnel of the board has been increased by one, it is very probable that the Western Australia representative will not attend more than a few meetings of the board. He will be concerned with the general policy to be decided upon for putting the act into operation. But it is unlikely that he will be a regular attendant at the meetings. As this board will not be so large as that provided for under the Dairy Produce Export Bill, no provision has been made for an executive. It will probably facilitate the work of the Hoard if the quorum remains as provided for in the bill. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- This clause embodies a principle similar to one contained in the Dairy Produce Export Bill. When a board is to be appointed with statutory powers, the question arises whether it should have control of the produce with which it has to deal, or whether that control should rest with the Minister. In connexion with the other bill, I gave notice of an amendment to the effect that the word "Minister " be deleted, and the word " board " be inserted in lieu of it, but in this case the board itself should have power to issue licences. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government cannot accept the amendment. The bill proposes to hand over control of the export trade to the board, and it is hoped that this power will be exercised in a way to which no exception can be taken. The object of leaving the issue of licences under the control of the Minister is that the Government shall have a power of veto, if the necessity should arise, but otherwise there will be no interference with the board's control. </para>

                    <para>.- The various measures introduced by this administration for governmental or semi-governmental control of industries conflict so much with the electioneering declarations of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> that he does not know how to camouflage them. He is now seeking to remove all appearance of government control of the dried fruits industry. The declared policy of the composite government included opposition to government control; trade was to be allowed to follow its natural channels. But many of the measures introduced lately have represented a departure from that principle. I remind the honorable member for Richmond that if we did not have government control we should have bureaucratic control. He is proposing to hand over to a board, over which this Parliament will have only limited authority, the right to control exports, and to give licences to some people and refuse them to others. The honorable member urged that the issuing of licences should be automatic, and that there should be no discrimination; then he proceeded to argue that discrimination would be necessary, but that it should be exercised by the board, and not by the Minister. The granting or refusal of a licence to export is a very big power. and its removal from parliamentary control through a Minister would be a mistake. </para>

                    <para>.- Does this clause mean that no compulsion is to be applied to the producers of dried fruits, and that the board shall control the export of only such dried fruits as the producers voluntarily place under its control ? If so, it appears to me that the clause conflicts to some extent with clause 19, which defines the particular powers of the board. A legal opinion obtained in regard to corresponding clauses in the Dairy Produce Export Control Bill indicates that clause 16 could with advantage be omitted, and the following limiting words struck out of clause 19, " with respect to any dried fruits placed under its control." </para>

                        <para>- This amendment would certainly not be popular with those people in my electorate who may be termed " outsiders," but if carried it would in the long run act in the interests of the whole of the producers. The outsider should be compelled to contribute his quota of dried fruits for the export market, which is unprofitable. The producers in comfortable circumstances have no need to take advantage of the advances to be made under the bill recently passed, which will be obtainable only if a certain proportion of their dried fruits is exported. They will therefore have the full advantage of the profitable home market. On the other hand, returned soldiers who have settled, on the River Murray and the new settlers there, in order to take advantage of the advances under the bill recently passed, will have to contribute their quota of dried fruits for export. My object in moving the amendment is to remedy this unsatisfactory position. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Angas has moved an amendment which, if carried, will .make the bill more compulsory in character than it is now. The bill appears to provide for the voluntary placing of fruit for export under the control of the board, growers who so desire remaining free. That appearance, however, is only superficial, because clause 18 provides that when the board has been appointed no contracts for the carriage of dried fruits by sea to any place beyond the Commonwealth shall be made, except by the board acting as the agent of the owners of the dried fruits, or of other persons having authority to export dried fruits, in conformity with conditions approved by the board. The placing of fruit under the control of the board is a voluntary matter, but even if a grower had obtained a licence to export, he would be unable to export by sea unless the board made a contract for him, or approved of the exportation. He would be at liberty to export by seaplane or airship, but he could not export by steamer. The bill, therefore, is compulsory, and the amendment moved by the honorable member for Angas would produce no effect in the direction he desires, but might lead to a great deal of complication. The honorable member proposes that clause 16 should read - " Power is hereby given to the board to take control of any dried fruits for export." That language is so loose that interminable difficulties might arise under it. For instance, what is " dried fruits for export <inline font-style="italic">"1</inline></para>

                        <para>- Then I suggest that the honorable member should reconsider . the form of the amendment, because in its present form it would make the bill a general expropriation measure in relation to dried fruits. If it is intended to expropriate owners and acquire fruit compulsorily, or to acquire control of fruit compulsorily, the board would need to act very carefully, as otherwise it would, from a legal point of view, find itself in serious trouble. The amendment does not give all the power which the honorable member desires should be given to the board. </para>

                <para class="block">It is a common thing in all bills dealing with the expropriation of owners to provide for the payment of compensation, which is assessed in a particular way, and to include a clause providing for the disposal of the money resulting from sales. The amendment, as it stands, is dangerous. The honorable member for Angas has suggested that if agreed to it will enable the board to compel growers to export a certain quota of their fruit. I quite understand the object in view, but the amendment will not bring it about. " Power to take control for the purposes of the act " means to take control of fruit submitted for export, for which application for a licence is made. </para>

If application is made, a licence is granted on terms and conditions laid down, and then (he fruit can be exported only if the contract for sea carriage is approved by the board.

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment of the honorable member for Angas. The Government has made it perfectly clear that it is not prepared to take power compulsorily to acquire dried fruits. The amendment would give that power. I agree with the honorable member for Kooyong, that if the amendment were agreed to the whole bill would need recasting. In actual practice the only result of the amendment would be to compel the outsider to contribute to the export quota. Under the bill, the board will have the greater part of the fruit for export placed voluntarily under its control. There will probably be one authority controlling the export of fruit in this country, and another authority in London. </para>

                    <para>.- I appreciate the motive of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> in moving the amendment, and also that of the Government in refusing to accept it. The Prime Minister has made it quite clear that he has rejected it on the ground not of impracticability, but of policy. It will be useless to appoint an Export Control Board without giving it full power to acquire compulsorily the fruit that is to be exported. What an unfair position the board will be in if it is able to increase the market abroad for Australian dried fruit, and the local producers will not give to it sufficient fruit to supply the demand. When a measure, to control the export of meat was before us some time ago, a provision was inserted at the request of the graziers' organization to compel all graziers to make available a certain proportion of their produce for export. A similar provision should be inserted in this bill. Without the power to compel, fruit-growers to supply fruit for export the board will be not only useless, but dangerous. The scheme will fail unless compulsory power is given to the board, and the Government will have* to bear the responsibility -for its failure if it will not accept this amendment. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Clause 17 -of the draft bill differs from  section 13 of the New Zealand Act an that it operates merely when dairy produce is voluntarily placed under the control of the board, whilst section 13 of the New Zealand Act enables the board compulsorily to assume a complete or limited control over any dairy produce for export . . . The difference between clause 17 and section 13 (of the New Zealand Act) is accentuated by the difference between clause 20 of the draft bill and section 16 of the New Zealand Act. Section 16 is perfectly general . . . Clause 20 (of the Commonwealth bill) is not without ambiguity. I am of opinion that . . . the operation of the clause is confined to any dairy produce voluntarily placed under the control' of the board . . Thus the power to make arrangements, and give directions for the -matters following instead of applying to all dairy produce . . . applies only to cases where the dairy produce has been voluntarily placed under control . . . </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that while the Government professes that this is a voluntary measure, compulsion runs right through it. How can we control produce other than by compulsory measures? The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> has moved a logical amendment. The Government is proposing to set up a body, with the authority of the country behind it, to export dried fruits under prescribed regulations, with the object of relieving a suffering industry, and of ensuring that our surplus dried fruits shall be marketed abroad under the best possible conditions. That proposal has been commended by honorable members of all parties, but the question is: How can it be most effectively and most equitably achieved? Whether the provisions of the bill will achieve it effectively only time will tell. The honorable member for Angas is concerned about achieving it equitably. He pointed out that certain advances are to be made to fruit-growers under .a measure which has already been passed on the condition that a proportion of their produce is exported. Fruit-growers who are new to the industry, and particularly many returned soldiers, who have been settled recently in the fruit-producing areas, will be compelled to apply for the advance notwithstanding that it will be less profitable to them to export their fruit than it would be to sell it in the local market. </para>

                        <para>- We are not legislating for war time, but for peace conditions. The aim of the amendment is to ensure that not only the struggling fruit-growers, but also the wealthy and well-established growers, shall export a fair quota of their surplus production. If the wealthy fruit-growers are compelled to export their proper proportion of fruit, the small and struggling growers will be able to sell a fair proportion of their production on the more profitable local market. That is as it should be. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. The only satisfactory method of stabilizing an industry is to form compulsory pools under government control. It is very well known that the greatest enemies of the wheat-growers are wheat-growers who will not place their wheat under the control of the voluntary pools, and be loyal to their fellow producers. If we have control, all the' growers should be treated alike. I have always stood for the compulsory pooling of wheat, and I am prepared to support the compulsory pooling of dried fruits. We ought to take legislative action to prevent excessive quantities of dried fruits from being sent out of this country. We ought to see that local requirements are met, and that cannot be done without control. </para>

                        <para>- 1 am as much in favour of fixing prices that will give the grower of produce a decent minimum rate for his labour as I am in favour of fixing a decent minimum wage for the workers in my electorate. I do not expect members of the Country party to endorse that statement. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> pretends to' be an uncompromising freetrader. He speaks in favour of freedom in all things, and is an anti-socialist of the first water; but he is prepared to be even a socialist when it will profit him. I heard him criticizing the Government last night because it had not done something to secure preferential trade with Canada. I submit that preferential trade is not consistent with freetrade, but is, in fact, ' the antithesis of freetrade. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the protectionist says. We say that we should take advantage of the Australian market for the benefit of the Australian manufacturer and the Australian producer. That is protection, and I am glad that the honorable member is veering round to the economic policy for which I stand. I wish we had control of local distribution and local markets. We have the spectacle to-day of fruit-growers starving on their land because they are unable to get reasonable prices, while the people in the cities have to pay famine prices for fruit. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that it is the retailer who inflates the price. Many people come between the grower and the retailer. I realize that there is a surplus of dried fruits in Australia, and that the size of that surplus will increase in the next few years when the hundreds of thousands of acres of land that have been planted come into bearing. We shall then be faced with a very big problem. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but the quantity imported is very small by comparison with the quantity produced in Australia. Australia imported gold when it was producing it in large quantities. Such anomalies under the present system are inexplicable. I suggest to the honorable member for Swan, who lectured us on economics, that we have probably gone too far in extending the fruit industry, and in settling returned soldiers on the land. Whether that is so or not, we must face the problem as it exists. If we bring thousands of people from overseas and settle them on the land, whether to produce wheat, fruit, or butter, without providing local markets by creating secondary industries in the towns, we shall be buying trouble, and setting up a balance against the men we are sending to the back country. A sound protectionist policy is required to build up our secondary industries. In providing for exporting the surplus of our produce, we should do it equitably. I commend the honorable member for Angas for his suggestion, which will be equitable as between the big and the little man, and the rich and the poor man. </para>

                    <para>.- One important consideration arises on this amendment. If the amendment means that the board shall have power to take control of any dried fruits and to compel the grower to export a fair proportion of them, it is very doubtful whether this Parliament has power to pass it. I have at this stage no interest in this bill other than the desire to assist the committee to produce a workmanlike act that will stand criticism. The Commonwealth Parliament has full power to legislate for foreign and interstate trade. It can deal with an article in foreign trade, and, therefore, it has power to legislate in the manner prescribed in clause 18, concerning contracts for the shipment of dried fruits. But, speaking generally, it has no power to deal with an article before it has become the subject-matter of foreign trade. In other words, it cannot empower an official to go into a man's fruit-shed and say, "You must export 80 per cent. of this fruit," any more than it can empower an official to say to me, " You must export your watch and chain." To say that I must export my watch and chain is not to deal with foreign trade, but to endeavour to compel me to make my watch and chain an article of foreign trade. As I understand the commerce power of the Commonwealth, the essence of it is that when an article becomes the subject-matter of foreign trade, we have power over it, but we have no power to compel a man to export his goods. Also, we have no power to control the local market. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said he favoured control of the local market. It appears to me that from an economic point of view foreign and local markets hang together. I am not expressing any view of the general merits of the bill, but it appears obvious that a complete scheme would involve control of the local market. In time of war the Commonwealth, under its defence powers, can control local markets. </para>

                        <para>- The states could, by legislation, introduce a complete scheme for the control of all trade within Australia, and, with the help of the Commonwealth, of all Australian foreign trade.

                    <para>.- The committee is now considering a clause that is capable of very wide application, and I should like at this juncture to make some observations on the compulsory sale and marketing of primary products.  I  candidly confess that I am not in love with legislation that interferes with trade and industry. I am not in love with compulsory tariffs. I am not in favour of compulsory legislation which, following upon the compulsory tariff, increases the cost of living so that the workers have to fall back upon compulsory arbitration to protect them from exploitation. Some of the members of the Country party - and I make the qualification because I do not desire to take upon myself the responsibility of speaking for the whole of the members of that party know that, whether we are enthusiastic about these things or not, if we desired to alter them we should be defeated as we have been in the past by an overwhelming majority. We are faced with the fact that we are in a helpless position, and must bear these imposts resulting from compulsory legislation, which vitally affect the primary producers, and are amongst the causes of the distress in the dried fruit industry to-day. The producer of dried fruits must pay wages fixed by compulsory arbitration, and is compelled to sell them in competition with producers in other parts of the world who have the advantage of coloured labour and in Mediterranean countries who have the advantage of cheap labour. The question arises, what are we to do? </para>

                        <para>- I should not like to do that. We have to face the position of the primary producer as we find it. Are we to helplessly beat our hands against the wall clamouring for things that are unattainable? When we are faced with, this system of regulated profits for manufacturers and regulated wages for workers, can we be fairly charged with inconsistency if we say that whilst we do not believe in a system which makes gifts and doles to others we are compelled to accept the results of that system and hop into the ring to secure our share along with the rest? </para>

They can regard legislation, which goes even so far in the direction of compulsion as the bill now under consideration, with a good deal of satisfaction, because in supporting it they are achieving that which they have laid down as their policy. They are doing more, because they are placing those who have endeavoured to oppose some of the compulsory legislation to which I have referred in the inconsistent position of supporting this measure as a means of finding a way out of the difficulties in which that legislation has placed the primary producers. </para>

                        <para>- I shall do so. ' I understand that by interjection the honorable member for Angas has foreshadowed other amendments, and his purpose is to enact the principle of compulsion to acquire dried fruits for export. I have come to the conclusion that while the circumstances, which I have briefly outlined, exist there is no other way in which we can effectively organize the marketing of primary products than by compulsion. This bill goes half a dozen steps in the right direction and stops short of providing for an effective control of the industry. I must, in the circumstances, say that I intend to support the amendments of the honorable member for Angas. I recently addressed at Mildura a most representative gathering of those engaged in the dried fruits industry. Those present represented about 2,000 growers of Mildura, Merbein, and Red Cliffs. The meeting passed unanimously a resolution in favour of a compulsory pool. If the amendments foreshadowed </para>

                    <para>.- I think I might be accused of a lack of sympathy with my socialistic friends on the other side if I allowed a measure of this kind to pass into law without at least making an attempt, however feeble, to add something to the sum of wisdom developed in the debate. I have had the advantage of listening to  the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> to whom the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> addressed a very pertinent but most embarrassing question, to discover what he really did think on the merits of the amendment. The honorable member for Kooyong appeared to believe that a grave attack had been made by the honorable member for Angas upon his good faith, which really was not in issue at all, nor had it been suggested as a subject for discussion by practical -politicians. I may say at once that I do not impeach the good faith of the honorable member for Kooyong. I have every confidence in that, but I do not admit that he is impeccable, or that his judgment is in all matters wholly faultless, as ho would seem to suggest by the tone he adopted towards the honorable member for Angas. I do not go so far, in the interests of a fellow member of an affiliated union. The honorable member has given us the advantage, at very moderate cost, of his legal opinion on the constitutional aspect of the amendment. I hardly think that the committee is prepared, at a moment's notice, to pass judgment on that aspect of the case. I am convinced that the honorable member for Kooyong could, for an adequate consideration, present an equally convincing argument upon the other side, when we should be left in some doubt as to the true construction of the amendment from the constitutional point of view. I referred a moment ago to my  socialistic friends on the other side, and my principal object in rising to discuss this bill is to say a word or two on that subject. It is true that the consumers who buy these various commodities, in respect of which we have been legislating so freely during recent months, have been very little considered. I represent persons who do not export dried fruits, butter or cheese, and who have no butter or cheese factories among them. I represent a handful of some 40,000 electors, mostly working people, who are under the necessity of paying, for the most part, substantial prices for the various commodities about which we have legislated so freely in this chamber. I am perfectly satisfied that whilst the Country party is moving in the right direction, is proceeding from the chrysalis to the full-fledged butterfly with a degree cf certainty  of movement, it has not yet become in fact qualified to describe itself as the Socialist party in  this House. We have had before us measures in regard to meat, wheat, wool, fruit, wine, and various other primary products, as they are called. Although the Country party was returned to this Parliament for the restoration of the great principles of constitutional government, and the eradication of government interference with private enterprise, we still find that honorable members in the Corner are not incurably opposed to government interference with private enterprise, so long as by that means there is diverted a sufficient sum out of the  public  funds into private pockets. The honorable member for Kooyong is as yet only in the elementary class of this new school. He is in a very high class in another school, but he is a first-form boy in the matter of socialistic development, and so he approached the whole subject with the utmost diffidence. He asked the other day, "If butter, why not potatoes?" or words to that effect. I ask, "If potatoes, why not peanuts, and if peanuts, why not dried fruits? Why not anything at all?" The honorable member is behind the times. He sits with the Country party, and gives tentative support to the Nationalist party, but he is not yet, like the members of the Country party, a convinced believer in the great principle of Socialism, for which my colleagues and myself, in our hesitating and careful way, stand. The honorable member rightly, asks, "Where will it end?" I listened to his speech with the greatest interest, and it reminded me- of an occasion in my youth, now some twenty years or more, in the back-wash of history. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and you, sir, will see that the connexion is complete, if I am permitted to finish my illustration. If I am not, the committee will be the loser. I was about to say that, some twenty years ago I attended a bush concert, at which a young man sang a ballad about a love-lorn couple. It had about twenty-five stanzas; at the end of each, rendered in dolorous tones, was the refrain, "And I wonder where the dickens it will end." Now, sir, you are about to see the relevancy of the story to the matter before the Chair. I may mention, incidentally, that the sentiment expressed by the singer began to be painfully shared by the audience, who also were asking themselves, "Where the dickens will it end?" You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> will agree that an uneasy feeling like that which agitated the bucolic mind of the country singer is disturbing the erudite mind of this King's Counsel, who graces this chamber as one of its most brilliant members. The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning),</inline> too, addressed himself to the measure from the point of view of price fixation. He has committed himself to this bill, I understand, as to that for the control of dairy produce. If, for the purpose of illustrating the powers that are given to the board, I may be permitted for a moment to refer to clause 19, it will be seen to what extent government interference with the great and eternal principles of private enterprise is proposed. No person is to export dried fruit - or, under the other bill, butter or cheese - without the consent of a board, and without obtaining a licence. In other words, not only are the rights of private enterprise to be seriously impinged upon, but, with the consent of the Country party and their Nationalist friends and servants, private enterprise has been driven off the grass altogether. Under clause 19 this board will have full authority to make such arrangements and give such directions as it thinks fit for the&gt; following matters : - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>The handling, marketing and storage of the dried fruits. </para><para>The shipment of the dried fruits on such terms and in such quantities as it thinks fit. </para><para>The sale and disposal of dried fruits on such terms as it thinks fit. </para><para>The insurance against loss of any such dried fruits either in the Commonwealth or in transit from the Commonwealth and until disposed of; and </para><para>All such matters as are necessary for the due discharge of its functions in handling, distributing and disposing of the dried fruits. </para><para class="block">Most people would say that those provisions make a pretty considerable inroad upon the cherished principle that there should be no government interference with private enterprise. But the honorable member for Macquarie takes refuge behind the fact that there is no provision in the bill for the fixation of prices. "Ah!" he says, "that is the rock of ages with me. That is the reason why I support this bill when I cannot support the Labour party in its socialistic proposals." Some day&gt; - in the recess, perhaps - I may have time to write a book, and, if I do, its title will be <inline font-style="italic">The Economic Evolution of Fellow Worker Manning.</inline> His attitude towards this measure reminds me of the interesting history of that well-known character,  Sairey  Gamp. She, as will be remembered, was, in her own opinion, a confirmed teetotaller, though under stress of circumstances, and being required to do hard work, she occasionally, so she tells us, placed a bottle by the bedside, and put it to her lips just when she felt " so  dispoged.'  The honorable member for Macquarie is a whole-hearted teetotaller in the matter of socialism. He does not take it; he is opposed to it. But he places it by the bedside, and he puts it to his lips when he feels the need of it, and is "so dis.poged." In the little book which I propose to write when I have the time, I may raise this question of speculative philosophy, " What would the comrade's attitude have been if the Government' had made provision in the bill for acquiring the fruit - or it might be butter, or something else - at a price?" </para><interjection>

                        <para>- That is so. I have an idea, that the comrade would say, first of all, "Well, have I any of this commodity for sale?". Then he would ask," " What is the price the Government proposes to pay for it?" I think that if he had a  commodity  to sell, and the price was satisfactory, he would be prepared to take quite a liberal potation of socialism. Indeed, we might then expect to find him - in a purely political sense, of course - hiccoughing his firm opinion that, although he did not believe in socialism, he did keep it by the bedside, but merely kept it to put to his lips if he " felt so  dispoged."  The other evening I quoted with approval some remarks of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart).</inline> I quoted them at great length, even at peril of being called to order, and I confess to having had greater difficulty then than I have now in connecting my remarks with the subject before the </para>

                        <para>- Apparently not. He applied it to certain imperfectly healed patches of the" pact of which honorable members have some knowledge. He was referring to certain blackmailers who shall not be named, but whose  identity  has been indicated by my honoured leader. We have departed from the sound principles of constitutional government. We have seen the  day  come in our own time and generation when private enterprise is to be overwhelmed by government interference; when wool and wheat, peas, potatoes, peanuts, and other things are to be controlled by this Parliament in the interests of the people. Some have taken the plunge, 'like the honorable member for Wimmera, and are swimming in these uncharted seas as confidently as if they had been returned to advance the great cause of socialism. Others, like the small boy, have taken off their clothes to bathe, but dipping their toes in the water, have remarked, " Ah, but it is cold," and do not take the plunge. Of such is the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> I am glad to know that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman (Mr. Cook),</inline> as a representative of the primary producers, uphold the right of the Government to interfere with private enterprise. I congratulate you on the great success of your party in inducing the National party to bend to its will. On the forefront of the Prima Minister's banner, when he came into this Parliament, and on the forefront of the banner of his spouse, the Leader of the Country party - these dual leaders - was "Restoration of Constitutional Government. Banishment of Socialism from the Land. We are the Australian Fascisti." The Prime Minister declared himself another Mussolini. So they came, creating new hope in the hearts of the people, and telling them that for ever the dangerous revolutionaries were banished from power, and that in future sober and safe lines of government would be followed, in short, that there was to be a throwback to the reactionary times of half a century or more ago, in order that not merely industries, but the Commonwealth as a. whole, might be stabilized. There are. some people outside this Parliament who, seeing the Prime Minister - the still, strong man - sitting at the table, would imagine that he really is leading the Ministry and governing the Commonwealth. But the leadership comes from the Country party, the members of which are entitled to take to themselves all possible kudos for what they have done in this Parliament. Well may the honorable member for Wimmera look sad; I fear that he has backed the wrong horse. Let us look at the legislation that has been introduced during this session, and ask ourselves who has dictated it. The answer is that honorable members in the ministerial corner have dictated it in the interests of their masters who sent them here; and when the still, strong leader speaks as though he leads, he actually speaks and leads only as the pliant instrument of the reactionaries of the Country party, who, in turn, serve faithfully the squatter and the middleman under an unconvincing pretence of serving the working farmer. Thus the patchy pact has been maintained in part; I wonder for how long. Out of this situation there comes a homely illustration of the old proverb that " Honesty is the best policy." When principle gave way to expediency, all seemed well, for a time, and nothing but expediency appeared to matter, but gradually the mortification of distrust and suspicion is being set up in the body of the composite conspiracy party, whose disintegration is in process. One member leaves it, and then another leaves it, and comrades jump in to take the jobs that have been vacated. And by-and-bye, when they in turn have been conducted to the bathroom, some other colleagues, who vowed allegiance to them, will spring forward to grasp the spoils that have been laid down by the latest victims. So the pact will proceed until the next general election, when the trump, of the electoral archangel shall call them to account, and the compact be disrupted into invisible atoms. </para>

                        <para>- Tha clause dia  tinctly  provides "that the board may accept control of any dried fruits placed under its control for the purposes of this Act." If I have said anything that is inconsistent with the terms, of that clause I apologize, but it seems to me that everything I have said was directly germane to the clause, and to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Angas. I have referred to those gentlemen, who, for the advancement of personal interests, have diverted public funds into private pockets, and I have spoken of their methods. What, then, is my attitude towards members of the Labour party who support this and similar bills? I shall vote with them in support of the principle of the bill. Members of the Labour party do not oppose this class of legislation. We believe in the principle underlying it, and for the moment we are not concerned with the motives actuating members of the Country party. We support the bill in the hope that by a variety of amendments it may be brought completely into harmony with the views and policy of the Labour party. For that ' reason I approve of th6 principle of the amendment. I shall not, like the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> take the risk of pronouncing judgment as to its legality, and shall certainly not give an opinion in opposition to his, because that would be rank heresy, as well as a breach of the rules of the affiliated unions of which he and I are members. The Labour party stands for the interests of the primary producer, as it does for the interests of the wage earner and every other class of the community, but all we hear from honorable members of the Country party is a constant reiteration of "the primary producer" until at night one dreams that phrase. It is as if there were no person who had work to do in this country but the primary producer ; no , person who had to pay through the nose for primary products, and nobody worthy of consideration other than the primary producer, for whom honorable members of the Country party claim to speak exclusively. A few evenings ago I entered a small shop in a main street of Melbourne . to buy some fruit, and the only apples for sale were quoted at 8d. per lb., and the oranges at 3d., 4d., and 5d. each. A few months hence when we travel into the country Ave may see within 15 or 16 miles of Melbourne trees laden with beautiful apples, and the ground strewn with windfalls which apparently are not worth gathering. Will the primary producers wake up and explain why in a country which produces a superabundance of fruit which will keep for a year, the majority of people of the working classes cannot afford the luxury of purchasing it. With the greatest respect I say to the dairymen, orchardists, and stockbreeders, that they could do a great deal more for themselves instead of constantly sitting on the doorstep of the Cabinet. I believe in Government interference with private enterprise, but I do not believe in the primary producer becoming a regular mendicant at the door of Parliament House. The long faces of honorable members of the Country party would lead one to think that the lot of the primary producer was similar to that of the dweller in the slums of some of the great cities of Europe and other continents, that they are reduced below the capacity of self-help, and must have the aid of this Parliament for everything. I do not agree with that. As a rule the primary producer has some independence, and enough grit and capacity to do something for himself by co-operative effort. One thing I wish him to do is to endeavour to organize the marketing of his fruit at prices which, whilst ensuring to him an adequate return, will bring that essential article of diet within the means of some of the poor electors of such densely populated districts as Batman, East Sydney, and West Sydney. Those people do not include any primary producers, but let them be considered sometimes. There is no reference to them in this bill, or in any other of the bills that have been introduced by the present Government during .this session, and if we talk about improving their lot we are at once accused of having hoisted the red flag of socialism, and honorable members of the Country party retire, precipitately, into their caves. In their caves for the moment I leave them. </para>

Therefore, I am prepared to risk the amendment being declared unconstitutional, in the hope that it may do something for those engaged in the production of dried fruits. The honorable member was wrong in saying that I doubted his honesty of purpose. I merely expressed a conviction that he would not support compulsion on this question in any form. Whilst I have no reason to regard him as other than a gentleman, he belongs to a profession which 'requires him sometimes to argue that black is white, and in this House I think he will do his best to show his party to the greatest advantage.  His  statement that I had been offensive to him was quite uncalled for. I desire to place on record the other amendments I shall move if that now before the committee is accepted. I propose to move the insertion of. the following provisions: - </para>

If it will be necessary for the board to approve of the contract before the Customs Department can certify that the dried fruits may leave this country, special regulations should be issued allowing the Customs Department to permit the export of small quantities of dried fruits by persons who obtain a licence and comply with the conditions therein laid down. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause deals only with contracts for shipping, and not with the issuing of licences or with the powers of the board respecting them. Clause 18 provides that a contract may be entered into in conformity with conditions approved by the board. In the case of Eastern trade, I have no doubt at all that general conditions will be laid down under which a shipping contract will be permitted in the case of a person wishing to export dried fruits, and he will be able to make his shipping arrangements without obtaining the approval of the board for each specific shipment. I do not think that there will be the slightest interference in cases such as that suggested by the honorable member. </para>

It is the intention of the Government that the Commonwealth Bank shall be employed wherever possible, but circumstances may arise which will make desirable and convenient the use of another bank. For instance, transactions might be required in a place where there is no branch of the Commonwealth Bank, and grave inconvenience, and possibly loss, might be caused to the producers if, in such a case, special banking arrangements had to be made. </para>

As a rule, when there is a misunderstanding, the clause is put again, and if the honorable member for East Sydney had persisted in a request that the clause should be put again, it would probably have been put again. He did not do so, and the question has been decided. The honorable member for East Sydney was indignant at the slight he thought <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> received.

                    <para>. - I regret that a division was not called for in committee. We have had experience of boards similar to that proposed in the bill. The Commonwealth Government has a large interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Three representatives of the Government sit on the board of directors of the company. The first balance-sheet of the company showed that it was dealing with the Commonwealth Bank, but the next one showed t hat it had transferred its account to a private bank. I want to know why the Commonwealth Government's representatives on the board agreed to transfer the account to a private bank. Is not the Commonwealth Bank sufficiently stable? It is impossible to get any satisfactory explanation by addressing questions to Ministers. The bill provides an opportunity to another board to continue that policy. The Commonwealth Bank should do all the financial business of the Commonwealth, and we should stabilize our bank as well as our industries. </para>

                        <para>. - Since the inception of federation this Parliament has discussed many important measures dealing with defence, Customs, and other subjects, but no more important question could come before us than that of the unification of the gauges of the railways of this country. When federation was established, each of the six states had already undertaken railway construction on different gauges. Queensland adopted the 3-ft. G-in. gauge; New South Wales, 4-ft.  8½ in  ; Victoria, 5-ft. 3-in.; and South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania had built lines with varying gauges. One of the hopes based upon the accomplishment of federation was that a uniform railway gauge would be adopted throughout the Commonwealth. We have uniform postage, uniform telephone charges, and a uniform law governing quarantine and shipping. For the proper development of the Commonwealth a uniform railway gauge is essential. As the various states had invested millions of pounds in the construction of railways at the time of federation, they could not be induced to agree to the adoption of a uniform gauge. Many conferences were held between state ministers and the officials of the railways departments, but they were unable to reach finality in the matter. In 1920 a conference was held between the prime minister of the Commonwealth and the premiers of the different states, and they agreed that the best thing to do was to appoint a commission of experts from overseas to deal with the matter. One of the ablest railway men in the United States of America and one in Great Britain were selected. . These gentlemen were brought here at the expense of the Commonwealth, and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garvin,,</inline> a capable big business man of Sydney, as  chairman,  they formed a  commission to inquire into and report on the question of the unification of the gauges of the railways in the Commonwealth. After examining all our railway systems, and considering the history of railway construction throughout the world, the commission recommended the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge as a standard gauge for the Commonwealth. After the presentation of the commission's report, a conference of state premiers and the prime minister of the Commonwealth was held, which adopted that report. The conference agreed that, for cheapness of construction, capacity, speed, and safety, the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge should be adopted. In the course of the consideration of the bill for the construction of the transcontinental line in South Australia and Western Australia, a distance of 1,051 miles, there was a long debate on the subject of the standard railway gauge. Representatives of Victoria were anxious that the line should be constructed on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; some considered that the 3-ft. 6 -in. gauge should be adopted; and, after full consideration, this Parliament decided that the line should be constructed on the 4-ft.- 8i-in. gauge. The Commonwealth, in this case, led the way in the adoption of the standard railway gauge. At one time the states of the United States of America had railways of different gauges, but it was found absolutely necessary in that country to adopt a uniform railway gauge. That was done at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds. At thf- present time it is possible for a man to get into a train in America and travel in the same carriage for a' full week across Canada or the United States. In Great Britain, also, it was found necessary for the economic working of the railway systems of the country and the safety of railway travellers to adopt a uniform gauge. In the bill before us the Government proposes the first step towards the adoption of a uniform railway gauge between New South Wales and Queensland. This is a bill for the construction of a line from Kyogle to South Brisbane. New South Wales already has two railways to the Queensland border, but those travelling to Brisbane must change at the border to a railway on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. This change of gauge is very inconvenient to the travelling public. It may be contended that as the bil! deals with the construction of a railway in which they only are concerned, Queensland and New South Wales should not call upon the Commonwealth to assist in its construction. New South Wales has already constructed a line along the north coast to Murwillumbah, and the construction of the line proposed by the bill would not bring more trade to that state. Each state in the Commonwealth is at the present time continuing to build railways of varying gauges. South Australia is building railways on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, and Queensland on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and delay in the adoption of the standard gauge in railway construction in the different states must add to the cost of conversion later. A proposal has been made for the construction of a direct line from Port Augusta to Hay on the standard gauge, which would be about 500 miles long, and which it is estimated would cost £8,000,000. It would lini up the transcontinental line with the New South "Wales system, and give a uniform gauge - if the proposed Kyogle to South Brisbane line were made - from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane. Such a line should be constructed for the defence of the country. </para>

                            <para>- The construction of such a line would also promote development. Some of the states object to this proposal. I should be prepared to support the conversion to the standard gauge of the existing line from Albury to Melbourne. Any one who travels between Melbourne and Sydney, as I do every week, must be impressed by the confusion which arises at Albury as the result of the break of gauge. Passengers arrive at Albury from Melbourne at night, and have to change trains in the midst of the confusion caused by the transfer of luggage from one train to the other. No one can contend that that is a satisfactory system. Going to Perth from Melbourne, a traveller by train must change from the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge to a railway on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, again to a railway on the 4 ft. -8£ in. gauge, and finally to another line on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. People who have travelled in other countries smile at the slow progress which Australia has made in the matter of railway transportation. The proposed line from Port Augusta to Hay would, as I have said, cost about £8,000,000, but it would open up new country and tap very prosperous districts in the Riverina and along the Murray River. To convert the line from Adelaide to Melbourne, and thence to Albury from the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge to the standard gauge would cost £21,600,000, hut we have spent much more than that for the defence of the country and to help the Empire. According to military experts we cannot do better for the defence of the country than adopt a uniform railway gauge which would facilitate the transport of men from one state to another in a time of emergency. It is estimated that the 'cost of the line from Kyogle to South Brisbane would be £3,500,000. The New South Wales and Queensland Governments are prepared to pay their share of the cost of the line. Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria, are not prepared to contribute to the cost, because they contend that the line will not benefit them in any way. The Commonwealth Government is prepared to advance the money that would have been paid by the other states as their share of the cost of the line if they had come into the scheme, and that seems to be the best way to overcome the difficulty. The linking up of Queensland with New South Wales by the proposed direct line will result in shortening the journey from Sydney to Brisbane by six hours, and it will save 100 miles of railway travelling, eliminating the climb over the Liverpool and New England Ranges. This Parliament should know no state boundaries iu a work of this importance, and all the states should participate in the scheme. An agreement was made between the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to share the cost of the extensive irrigation and water conservation works undertaken on the River Murray, and, although Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia will not reap any direct benefit from that expenditure, they will derive an indirect benefit owing to the increased prosperity that will accrue to the Commonwealth. There can be no logical objection to the linking up of the mainland states with a railway of uniform gauge. The military experts are united in contending that the weakest point in the defence of the Commonwealth is the lack of that uniformity. Queensland is more exposed than any other state to attacks from the East, and, if that state is to be protected, it is necessary to enable troops to be moved there without the delay that breaks of gauge occasion. I hope that honorable members will view the subject from a national stand-point. It should be remembered that New South Wales contributes its share towards the grants annually made to Tasmania. The scenery along the north coast of New South Wales is recognized as unequalled in any part of the world. The soil is rich and the inhabitants of that belt of country are among the most prosperous in the Commonwealth. The district produces some of the finest timber, and there is every prospect of the railway having a buoyant revenue. Last year, 99,109 passengers changed trains at Wallangarra. All the fruit sent from Queensland to the southern states has to be transferred at Wallangarra from the narrow, gauge of Queensland to the 4ft. 8-^ in. gauge of New South Wales. No less than 250,000 head of live stock had to be transferred at the Queensland border last year. Queensland is a state with great promise, and I believe that it will eventually become the most productive part of the Commonwealth. New South Wales is anxious to assist in the development of that portion of Queensland which will be served by the proposed line. At the present time, the traffic northward, on the coastal line, passes over the Clarence River by punt, but the New South Wales Government has decided to spend £1,000,000 in the construction of a bridge over the Clarence. The provision of the punt resulted in a 35 per cent, increase in the traffic, and I have no doubt that when the proposed line is completed it will pay handsomely. The bridge to be erected will be the most expensive in Australia. I hope that the proposed new line is only the first instalment of the work necessary for the unification of gauges, so that the people may travel between Brisbane to Perth without changing trains. The bill should be supported by all honorable members who regard themselves as true Australians. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Government on having brought down this bill, for it is the first practical step towards the consummation of an ideal that has long been cherished - the unification of the railway gauges of the Commonwealth. I do not intend to repeat the arguments of the ' honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley),</inline> but I agree with his contention that the proposal is of the utmost importance from the national point of view. The gauge that is accepted throughout the world as the best, and that has been adopted as the standard gauge for Australia, is that of the mother state of New South Wales. The Commonwealth has built the transcontinental line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta on the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge, but the other states have railways of 5-ft. 3-in. or 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, whilst South Australia has both gauges. The fact that the East-West line connects at each end with a railway of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is responsible for heavy charges' in transporting rolling-stock. It is a great pity that Australia does not enjoy the benefits of a uniform gauge as does the United States of America,' where rollingstock can be sent over the lines of rival companies. Had it not been for the breaks of gauge, this country would have been saved the expense caused at Albury when fodder had to be distributed for starving stock. The honorable member for South Sydney supported the present . proposal on the ground of its value from a defence stand-point. Not long ago I referred to the comparative isolation of the various capital cities of Australia, and I likened them to a series of islands that had direct communication with one another only by sea. A person desiring to travel by rail between Sydney and Melbourne, or Sydney and Brisbane, or Adelaide and Perth, has to change trains, and in time of war when it became necessary to transport troops from one state to another, enormous congestion and delay would take place at the breaks of gauge. With a unified gauge delay at the borders would be obviated, and transportation of troops would be further facilitated by the interchangeability of Commonwealth and state rolling-stock. During the great war rolling-stock from Great Britain, and even from America, was used on the French and Belgian railways, because the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge was common to all those countries. I am glad to say that the old parochialism and interstate jealousies which existed before federation, and of which the varying railway gauges are a relic, are dying out. At one time a New South Welshman was anathema to Victorians, and that feeling existed even during the early part of the war. When I transferred early in 1915 from a New South Wales regiment of light horse to a Victorian infantry battalion 1 committed two unpardonable offences - I was not only a light horseman entering an infantry battalion, but I was a New South Welshman joining a Victorian unit. But as the war proceeded and men from different parts of Australia were assembled in the various unite, interstate divisions disappeared, and we were glad to bo known only as " Aussies."

                    <para class="block">Force tried to' bring back to Australia the same national spirit, and I believe that people of the younger generation are gradually freeing themselves of the old parochialism and interstate differences, and are taking pride in their citizenship of Australia as a whole. For the advancement of this projected railway I pay a tribute to the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart).</inline> In May of last year I had the pleasure of accompanying him - he was then Minister for Works and Railways - and the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> over a big portion of the route to be traversed by this line, and we were able to see some of the country that will be opened up. Its developmental possibilities demanded consideration, but an interstate railway was required, and it was difficult to get it constructed by Queensland and New South Wales, because of their different gauges. An excellent opportunity w.as provided for the Commonwealth to help forward the scheme for the unification of gauges by assisting those two states to build a line from the terminus at Kyogle to South Brisbane. When the line is in operation it will do a great deal of developmental work, and the traffic will be sufficient to pay working expenses and interest, and possibly to establish a sinking fund. The area to be served, particularly the portion on the New South Wales side of the border, is probably the most closely-settled rural district iu Australia. Without seeing it it is impossible to imagine the richness of the country on both sides of the Macpherson Range. The visit of the honorable member for Wimmera  made him an even more ardent advocate of the line than he had been before, and although he is a Victorian representative, he did a great deal to bring about the agreement which has permitted of the introduction of this bill. For that attitude he received a great' deal of unmerited censure, and almost abuse, from the people and press of his own state, but being convinced that he was right, he persisted in his advocacy of the line. No credit is due to the Premiers of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, who in behalf of their respective states refused to bear any share of the cost of constructing the railway. However, in recent months there have been changes of government in each of those states, and I should like the Prime Minister to inform the House whether the present premiers have been consulted. It is possible that they may take a different view from that expressed by their predecessors, and that Victoria and South Australia, at any rate, will withdraw their parochial objections and recognize the national character of this project. The Prime Minister mentioned that the Government of New South Wales has promised to construct a bridge over the Clarence River to connect Grafton and South Grafton. I am sorry that that undertaking is not contained in the agreement. If the promise of the New South Wales Government is bona fide there can be no objection to its inclusion in the document that is now before the House. If that were done we would have some assurance that the bridge will be available for traffic by the time the railway is completed. Last year I was present at a reception by the mayors of Grafton and South Grafton to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> and the then Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart).</inline> Among others present was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers, the leader of the New South Wales Legislative Council, and he definitely promised that the state government would construct a bridge over the Clarence River. I cannot credit a newspaper statement that he has since denied having made the statement, because it was heard by ali those who were present at that reception. To make assurance doubly sure the undertaking should be included in the bill. A bridge at that point  has been promised for over 40 years. Between Grafton and South Grafton, the Clarence River is over half a mile wide, and has a maximum depth of 70 feet. It is a magnificent stream, but instead of being, as it should be, a great asset to the country, its very size and grandeur have acted as a bar to progress. Before constructing the north coast line from Sydney to South Grafton, the New South Wales Government should have built a bridge over the Clarence River as an outlet for the  traffic  from the rich lands of the north coast which are now served by the railway from Grafton to Murwillumbah. That railway commences on the north bank of the Clarence, and ends on the south bank of the Tweed. Its position  is worse than that of the transcontinental railway. The town of Lismore, with a population of over 10,000 people, supplied with gas, water, electricity, and sewerage services, is absolutely unconnected by rail with any other part of the Commonwealth,, and will remain so until a bridge is built across the Clarence River at Grafton. For years past the New South Wales Government has promised to build this bridge. I should like the bill to contain a provision making it obligatory for the New South Wales Government to construct a bridge across the Clarence River. The agreement provides for the re-grading and re-laying of the line between Grafton and Kyogle. This is at present a light line laid with 60-lb. rails. In the summer time a cloud of dust follows the train, much to the inconvenience of the passengers in the rear carriages. The newest engine used on that line was built in 1S78. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it runs regularly only between Casino and Kyogle. It is very necessary that that line should . be re-graded and re-laid so that heavy express traffic can be carried upon it. The proposed line will run practically straight from Brisbane South, saving a distance of 100 miles in the journey from Brisbane to Sydney, and will give the magnificent north coast district of New South Wales access to the Brisbane market, which is at present denied to it. Although a representative of New South Wales, I am glad that this line will traverse Queensland territory. I am not a " state righter," as are many other honorable members. I do not recognize state boundaries. I represent the whole of Australia, including Tasmania. I appeal to honorable members to rise above petty jealousies and to think, not of individual states, but of Australia as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement provides for the construction of a railway 97 miles in length, at a cost of £3,500,000. This is not an exorbitant sum, considering the engineering difficultes involved in crossing the Macpherson Range. The line, when constructed, will carry not only an increased interstate passenger traffic, but also heavy timber and other traffic. No loss will be sustained by the Commonwealth, because the line, when in use, is certain to show a profit. We shall experience none of the losses that are from year to year incurred on the Oodnadatta railway. Again I ask honorable members to take a broad and national view of this agreement. </para>

Although a Queenslander, I intend to put the case for the proposed railway from Grafton to South Brisbane from the viewpoint of an Australian. It seems to me a pity that we should have state boundaries, and the consequent jealousies, in this country. Without them many existing petty jealousies would not have arisen. When important national projects, such as that to unify the railway gauges of Australia, are being discussed, people are inclined to consider only whether the district in which they live will be benefited. This railway is a national one, and is one of the links in the proposed scheme to connect up the various capitals of Australia with a uniform gauge railway. On that ground I appeal to honorable members to put aside party politics and state rights, and to support the agreement. It so happens that Queensland and New South Wales are the states particularly interested in this railway, which really is the forerunner of others connected with the scheme. That the other states will not immediately benefit is no reason why honorable members should oppose this national project. The following is a report by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner made to the Minister for Works and Railways in 1920 : - </para>

                        <para>It appears to me to be unnecessary to estimate for or consider at present the adoption of a uniform gauge throughout Australia. The gauges of many of the existing lines, which run from distributing centres, would naturally remain as they are for many years to come, even if the adoption of a uniform gauge was immediately decided on, and it would only be necessary to consider at the outset the provision of a uniform gauge connecting the capitals. This could be accomplished by - </para>

                    <para class="block">This proposed line is to be constructed in accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 1 of that report. The fact that this work is to be carried out in New South Wales and Queensland should not deter honorable members of other states from supporting it. The re-conditioning of the line from Grafton to Kyogle, a distance of 85 miles, will cost £800,000; the making of the line from Kyogle to the Queensland border, a distance of 27 miles, will cost £857,000; and the portion from the Queensland border to South Brisbane, a distance of 70 miles, £1,250,000. The total cost of the work, which will be £3,500,000, is to be met by the Commonwealth providing one-fifth and the five states on the mainland four-fifths of the money on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The payments for which these various parties will be responsible are : - Commonwealth, £700,000; New South Wales, £1,127,000; Queensland, £410,000; Victoria, £819,000; South Australia, £267,000; Western Australia, £177,000. Unfortunately, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are not prepared to. pay their share at present, and the Commonwealth will have to pay it for them until they see the light. The line will be of considerable benefit to the southern states and to Australia, for it is a section of a complete scheme to connect Brisbane with Perth. The present length of that journey is 3,040 miles, and trains have to be changed five times <inline font-style="italic">en route.</inline> Any one who has witnessed the struggles of a mother and her children at a. break of gauge station such as Wallangarra or Albury, will have realized the inconvenience, confusion, and discomfort that that involves, although that aspect of the matter is of minor importance. Break of gauge stations greatly increase the cost of transportation. At Wallangarra, for instance, a special transhipment staff has to be employed permanently. It is the same at Albury. The construction of the Grafton to South Brisbane line will reduce the travelling time of the Sydney to Brisbane journey from 26 hours to 20 hours, and will shorten the journey by at least 100 miles. The proposed line will pass through and encourage settlement in some of the finest country in Australia, and will make available to the rich Kyogle district and to the other northern river districts of New South Wales, which contain some of the best land in the Commonwealth, the important metropolitan market of Brisbane. Australia is not singular in that she has to face a break of gauge problem, for Great Britain and the United States of America have both had that experience. In the early days of railway construction in those countries various gauges were adopted in different districts, and, years later, these gauges had to be unified. Australia's lack of foresight in railway construction is but another case of history repeating itself. The unification of railway gauges was a question of public importance in Great Britain as far back as 1846, but it was not until 1872 that the uniformity of gauges was secured. Two years after the first railway line was built in New South Wales, the then chief engineer for railways recommended to the government of the day that before the rails met at the Murray River the New South Wales railway system should be converted to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge to secure uniformity with Victoria, but, unfortunately, his recommendation was not adopted. Coming down to more recent history, I refer honorable members to the report on the defence of Australia, dated the 11th July, 1910, which Lord Kitchener presented to the Commonwealth Government, paragraph 11 of which reads - </para>

                        <para>I would also mention that railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted in lines that would appear to be more favorable to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country. Different gauges in most of the states isolate each system, and the want of systematic interior connexion makes the present lines running inland of little use for defence, though possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have temporary command of the s sea. </para>

                    <para class="block">Lord Kitchener, looking at the problem of the defence of Australia with the eyes of an expert, realized what a fearful danger our differing railway gauges would be to us if ever this country were invaded. Although some honorable members of this chamber tell us, in season and out of season, that the matter of paramount importance to them from a national point of view is the defence of the country, I regret to learn that they intend to oppose this bill. I hope that before doing so hey' will give earnest consideration to the wisdom of making a start to unify our railway gauges for defence purposes. The unification, of railway gauges has been discussed at almost every premiers' conference for the last 25 years, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as an ex-premier of Victoria, have, I feel certain, participated in some of those conferences, and I have no doubt that you have taken your part in urging the desirableness of unification.

                        <para>The Commonwealth Government was strongly in favour of a uniform railway gauge throughout Australia, and was prepared to go a long way in the matter of raising the money. This question had been discussed ever since federation, and nothing tangible had yet been done. Since the last conference, the matter had become more urgent, from a defence point of  views.  Failing an agreement on the question of unification, he asked the states to consider an alternative proposal to give the Commonwealth the power and facilities to construct a strategic railway to connect Adelaide and Brisbane, but taking a more direct route inland. This route would be much safer, from a defence point of view, and would shorten the distance between the centres very considerably. It had been advocated by the military experts. He asked what co-operation would the states afford the Commonwealth in the matter of Crown lands if it constructed the line. </para>

                            <para>- I assure you, sir, that I did not, for if I have not grown to like the Victorian climate I have learned to appreciate her people. The conversion of the railway gauges of Australia to  a  standard gauge was first recommended by a Royal Commission on the 11th April, 1913, but the work was not proceeded with, on account of the prohibitive cost. That commission estimated that the cost of conversion of all lines to the 4 ft. 8£ in. gauge would be £37,164,000, which, it apportioned as follows: - New South Wales £120,000; Victoria, £6,117,000; Queensland, £12,578,000; South Australia, £6,228,000; Western Australia, £10,840,000 ; and the Commonwealth Government, £1,281,000. If an attempt were made now to convert the existing lines to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, the cost would probably be at least twice as much as it was estimated to be in 1913. The estimated expenditure involved in carrying out the limited scheme to connect all the capitals proposed in 1913, was  £12,142,000, . which was made up as follows :  - </para>

A similar bill will be passed by the New South Wales Parliament, and we in the Commonwealth Parliament are now asked to do our part. I, first as an Australian, and secondly as a Queenslander, have very much pleasure in supporting the bill. I urge the Government to instruct the Railway Council, as soon as the agreement is ratified, to proceed with the work as expeditiously as possible. The, railway will take approximately three years to construct, and will give employment for that period to at least 1,000 workmen. A railway should not be built specially for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but the construction of this railway will relieve unemployment in both New South Wales and Queensland. For some time past the Queensland Government has been constructing a number of railways, some of which are nearing completion. Some of the men employed on them will shortly be out of work, and, as they are accustomed to railway construction, they could be re-employed on the Kyogle-Brisbane line. I appeal to all honorable members to vote in favour of the bill which, as it sanctions a big national project, is above party, and is worthy of the support of all honorable members of this chamber. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- The bill is to approve, ratify, and confirm the agreement made between the Commonwealth of Australia and the States of Queensland and New South Wales, for the construction of a standard gauge line from South Brisbane to Kyogle. The preamble refers to the conference of Ministers of the Crown in July, 1920, which dealt with the unification of the railway gauges. That conference subsequently appointed a Railway Commission of two experts, who were brought from Great Britain and America. That commission recommended the adoption of a 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge for a railway from Brisbane to Fremantle, a distance of 3,488 miles. The bill deals with the construction of the first section of this great national line. The passing of this measure will be the most definite move yet made to give effect to the important recommendation of the commission, and will permit of a commencement being made with a great national work that has been too long delayed. I feel sure that the merits of the proposal will so recommend themselves to the House that  the bill will be passed without amendment. The cost of this line will be £3,500,000. Under the agreement, the Commonwealth is undertaking to pay £1,963,000,  which is its one-fifth share, together with the amounts to be paid, temporarily, I hope, of £819,000 on behalf of Victoria, £257,000 on behalf of South Australia, and £177,000 on behalf of Western Australia. This is unfortunately necessary, because these three states are not yet willing to join in the scheme of unification. I hope that the action of the Commonwealth and the States of Queensland and New South Wales will induce the other states to stand up to their responsibilities. The length of the line to be built in Queensland is 70 miles, and in New South Wales 27 miles, while 85 ' miles of line between North Grafton and Kyogle is to be regraded, re-ballasted, and laid with 80-lb. rails. As the work will take approximately three years to complete, I hope that a start will, be made at once. The line is of national importance, and marks a forward move in the history of the development of the Commonwealth. It will be of undoubted strategic value for defence, and of immense advantage from a commercial point of view. It will allow of the quick carriage of fruit, perishable goods, and produce generally, from Queensland to the southern markets, without the difficulties we now have to contend with because of the break of gauge. Its advantage in time of drought cannot be over-estimated. It will also open up large tracts of new fertile country. In Queensland it traverses the whole of the fertile basin of the Upper Logan and its tributaries. The opening up of this rich district must result in increased production, increased population, and increased prosperity. It will also make available immense timber areas, and will help to develop further the rich lands of the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales and give to the settlers there a ready market for their products in Southern Queensland, which I maintain is their natural outlet. It will also effect a great saving of time in the journey between Brisbane and Sydney. At present the distance between those capitals by the route over the New England Range is 715 miles, but when the new line is constructed it will only be 608 miles. This will mean a saving of five hours and twenty minutes in the travelling time. It is very much to be regretted that the route in Queensland does not touch the very important town o£ Beaudesert, but misses it by about 4 miles. The residents of that town and district  are  amongst the most public-spirited and progressive people in Australia. Having the utmost confidence in the future prosperity and development of their great district, they commenced in 1902 the construction of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge tramway. This tramway was, with loans obtained from the Government, extended through Innis Plains to Rathdowney, and from Christmas Creek to Lamington, in 1909-10. The line was built in sections, first from Beaudesert to Taboomba, a distance of 12  miles  and thence to Rathdowney, a further 10 miles, on the right hand, and to Lamington, a further 10 miles, on the left hand. Trams are being run daily between Beaudesert and Taboomba, and to Rathdowney and Lamington, on alternate days. Including sidings, there is a total of 39 miles 29 chains of single line. The cost of construction and equipment to 1922 was £92,770 12s. 8d. Railway rollingstock is used to a large extent, and the tramway is maintained in a condition equal to that of government lines, and is subject to an annual government maintenance inspection.. The loans obtained from the government and the financial posi-tion of the line is shown in the following table : - <inline font-style="italic">£ 8.</inline><inline font-style="italic">d.</inline></para>

The Beaudesert Shire Council, the progressive body which constructed this tramway, is naturally concerned about its position now that it is proposed to run the South Brisbane to Kyogle line through the territory served by the tramway. It is intended that the only stopping-place in Queensland on the interstate line should be  Taboomba,  This town is the council's tramway junction, and is in the very heart of the area it serves. A considerable time ago, in connexion with an examination of the War Service Homes timber areas, I accompanied the ex-Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> on a visit to this district. Incidentally, I am glad to say that these timber areas are now all satisfactorily disposed of, and the important timber industry in that district has again revived. At a civic reception- tendered to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> the proposal to construct this line was brought before him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bell, M.L.A., other speakers, and myself. The Minister assured us that the council would not be overlooked when the de-' tails for the construction of the line were being considered. I should be glad, on behalf of my constituents, if the Prime Minister would intimate what the Government proposes to do for the council, now that the details of the construction of the railway line are being considered by the House. There I leave the matter for the present, feeling sure that the justice of the claim for consideration will commend itself to the Prime Minister and the House. This bill meets an urgent national need. The unification of our railway gauges cannot be deferred indefinitely. The longer it is delayed the greater the cost will be. I am glad that under this bill a commencement of this work is about to be made. I heartily support the bill, and trust it will have an early and safe passage. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a bill to amend the Income Tax Collection Bill of 1923, under which nothing was collected.  Honorable members are aware that its object was to provide for compensation to officers retired from the Service in certain circumstances. It was believed in 1923 that great economies would be brought about by the amalgamation of the Income Tax Departments of the Commonwealth and the states. We were invited to believe that in the first year no less than £260,000 would be saved as the result of the amalgamation The amount that was saved to the Commonwealth during the first year was about £60,000.- There was a transfer of some 600 officers from the Commonwealth to the State Departments, and whatever was saved to the Commonwealth in this way was transferred as an additional expense to the states. Apparently the dreams of the Treasurer in this connexion were not realized. Six hundred officers were transferred to the State Services, about 400 were transferred to other departments of the Commonwealth Service, and 150 voluntarily retired, and of this number some 100 have drawn compensation under the act of 1923. The taxation exemption has been raised from £200 to £300, and, apparently, it is believed that as this will lead to a smaller number of persons being assessed as taxpayers, a smaller staff will be required to carry out the work of the Taxation Department, and the services of other officers may be dispensed with. This bill is introduced in order that temporary employees, and returned soldiers whose services may be dispensed with, may receive compensation in the same way as those who were compensated under the original measure. In so far as the bill provides for compensation to returned soldiers and temporary employees whose services may be dispensed with, there is no objection to it, but I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to the need for a little extension of its scope. In June of last year the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> asked the Treasurer if it was a fact that he had promised that returned soldiers temporarily employed would be given an opportunity to sit for an examination, and whether the Income Tax Collection Bill would be amended in order that that might be done. The Treasurer replied that these men would be given the opportunity to sit for an examination. There is some doubt as to whether that is provided for in this bill. In the interval, a number of men have gone up for examination, and some have failed, not because they did not gain sufficient marks in the examination, or did not pass in the required number of subjects. They were returned as rejected because in some instances though they were required to get 1,300 marks, they secured 1,500, and in some cases because, though they passed in the required number of subjects, they failed in others. I say that every returned soldier, and every man whose services are to be dispensed with, whether he has in the meantime passed an examination or not, should be given an opportunity to pass an examination. He should not be asked whether he had attempted to pass an examination or was unable to pass it by reason of his war disabilities. He should be given the opportunity to sit for an examination, and if he could demonstrate that he was a person qualified to occupy a permanent position, he should be entitled to compensation under this bill. If the Treasurer will agree to the amendment of the bill in such a way as to provide for that, he will facilitate its passage, and prevent a great deal of discussion. </para>

                        <para>- I want to register my protest against the principle involved in this bill. It provides that public servants who have been employed by the Commonwealth for a certain length of time are entitled to compensation if their services are dispensed with. This principle was first adopted in connexion with the defence retrenchment scheme. It was followed last year, in the Income Tax Collection. Act, providing for compensation to officers of the Taxation Department retired as a result of the amalgamation of the State and Federal Taxation Departments. . I strongly object to the adoption of the principle that if officers are retired as the  result of the abolition of a department or retrenchment in the Public Service, they should be compensated. I see no reason why employees of the Commonwealth Government should be placed in a different position in this respect from persons in private employ and workers generally. The principle was wrong when first adopted, and I strongly protest against its perpetuation in this bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I would remind honorable members that the circumstances connected with the defence compensation scheme and the Taxation Department compensation proposal were very exceptional. In the case of the Defence Department a very drastic scheme of retrenchment was brought into operation, and many of the employees of the department would have been dealt with very harshly indeed if they had been suddenly thrown upon the labour market without compensation. In connexion with retirements from the Taxation Department the honorable member should remember that the officers of the department were led to believe that their employment would be more or less permanent, and they suddenly found it brought to a termination. The position which arose in connexion with these retirements is quite different from that which obtains in the Service generally, when one or two officers are found to be in excess of requirements, and their services are dispensed with. To meet the matter referred to by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> I move - </para>

Section 12a applies the principle of compensation to those whose services are now dispensed with on account of the policy of the Government in raising the exemption, and puts them in the same position as those whose services have been dispensed with, and have been compensated in the last fifteen months, owing to the economy resulting from the amalgamation of federal and state departments and the consequent diminution of work. </para>

                        <para>.- There are, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has said, special circumstances connected with the bill, but there is one feature to which I particularly draw attention. The persons to be compensated are temporary, and not permanent employees, and it should not be recognized as a general principle that temporary employees should receive compensation. One of the distinctions between the two classes of employees is that a permanent employee has statutory rights to compensation, and a temporary employee has not. This ought, to be treated as a special case, for otherwise the Government will be laying up for itself a good deal of trouble in future. </para>

                    <para>The measure expresses the proposal of the Government, which was outlined in the budget speech, that, for the future, tax shall not be collected on payments for admission to entertainments where the commissioner is satisfied that the whole of the net proceeds of the entertainment are, or will be, devoted to (i) the erection, maintenance, or furnishing of halls for public purposes, or memorial halls for the use of soldiers or sailors who served in the great war, or (ii) for such purposes as are, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation, either religious or public. It will be a condition of this exemption that the commissioner must be satisfied that the entertainment is not provided directly or indirectly for the financial benefit of any person connected with the promotion of the entertainment, or of any  person employed or engaged by that person for the purpose of the entertainment. The Government considers that entertainments with these objects are as much entitled to complete exemption from the tax as those for which exemption at present exists under section 12 of the principal act. The requirement of the bill that the Commissioner of Taxation shall be satisfied on all the points upon which exemption is dependent is considered necessary for the effective and economical protection of the revenue, and desirable from the point of view of prompt administration of the act. The amount of revenue involved by the proposal cannot be estimated with any degree of reasonable accuracy, but it is considered to be small. The exemption proposed would not relieve promoters of such entertainments from the necessity to apply to the Taxation Department for exemption, because it will be necessary for the department to be satisfied that the entertainment is one which falls within the exemption. Promoters of these entertainments, as in all other cases, will, therefore, continue to be liable to the penalties provided by the principal act for failure to register the entertainments with the department. The proposed exemption will operate from the date when the act receives the royal assent. </para>

I do not know whether entertainments for charitable purposes are exempt, but, if not, the matter is worthy of consideration. I have often brought under the Treasurer's notice the fact that the revenue derived from the tax on small social entertainments in country districts is so negligible that it seems hardly worth the expense to which the department is put in collecting it. I am aware that, since the difficulties attending the collection of this tax in the country have been brought under the notice of the Government, the regulations have been modified to some extent. For instance, application can now be made to any postmaster, but the regulations are nevertheless troublesome. Those organizing small entertainments have to register them and supply information in great detail. I am satisfied that if the tax were abolished so far as the entertainments to which I have referred are concerned, the loss of revenue would be negligible. The tax should apply only to entertainments conducted for the sake of profit. The present proposal is to exempt entertainments held for religious .or public purposes. </para>

                            <para>- It has not done so in my state until within the last year. I admit that recently the department has been a little more liberal in its administration of the act. I have received a great number of complaints from people living 250 miles or more from Perth who, if they were holding a little entertainment or dance, involving a charge for admission, had to apply to the department m Perth for permission to hold the entertainment, purchase tickets, and carry out a lot of other preliminaries, which were preposterously out of proportion to the small amount of revenue that the Commonwealth would receive from its tax. I am sorry that the Treasurer has not seen his way clear to fully exemp't small entertainments of that character, but I hope that the time is not far distant when the collection of entertainments taxation  will be left entirely to the states.  </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the claims of trustees of recreation grounds. For instance, the trustees of the Yarraville Cricket Ground hold an annual sports meeting, the net proceeds of which are expended in improving the recreation reserve. Those trustees are  performing a useful service in the interests of the public generally, and I think the proceeds of the annual sports gathering should be exempted from this taxation. Will the Treasurer inform me whether they are so exempt? </para>

The inestimable value of healthy sport to young people, and even to those of us who are no longer young, must be conceded by all honorable members. I am very disappointed that the Treasurer has not by this bill exempted the proceeds of amateur sports meetings from taxation, but I hope that next year he will do so. </para>

                        <para>.- Clause 2 grants exemption to entertainments for" such purposes as are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, either religious or public." I should like the Treasurer to inform me whether the words " either religious or public " embrace charitable purposes. I do not think they do. If it had been the intention of the Government to exempt entertainments for charitable purposes, the word " charitable " would have been included in the bill, but it must have been omitted through an oversight. I ask the Treasurer to accept an amendment for its inclusion.' There is at Newtown, near Hobart, a sanatorium for consumptives. For many years it has been doing magnificent work. It is maintained principally by public subscriptions and a government subsidy, and it is open to anybody whose circumstances preclude them from entering a private institution. </para>

Some time ago an entertainment was held to raise funds for the institution, but owing to unfavorable circumstances the proceeds were very small, just about sufficient to pay the entertainments tax. I conveyed to the Treasurer a request that the tax should be remitted, but although the Commissioner, to whom the matter was referred, expressed his sympathy with the committee of the institution, he said that, the case was parallel with many others, and the act precluded him from remitting the taxation, or repaying the amounts already received by the department. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad that the Treasurer has introduced this bill, because I have always held that the trouble involved in obtaining an exemption from the tax is even more irksome than the tax itself, especially to people in country districts several hundred miles from the state capital. On a previous occasion I tried to obtain a concession for the country bands that brighten life in rural towns, and give a musical education to many young Australians. For over 30 years the band at Inverell, in my home town, has been under the direction of an honorary conductor, and he has done a great deal towards the musical education of the young men in the district. He is a notable instance of the unselfish work that is done by many bandsmen. The proceeds of the entertainments given by the band are expended wholly in extending its usefulness to the community. No individual receives any  financial remuneration from the operations of the band. A country town without a band is a very dead place, and I think the Commonwealth might well take a broader view of activities of this kind, which are both recreative and educational, and recognize that inasmuch as these bodies make life in the country more enjoyable, they are entitled to consideration and assistance. Country bands, even if subsidized by the local councils, should not be required to pay a tax on their entertainments. </para>

                            <para>- If the Treasurer will give me an assurance to that effect, and will instruct the commissioner accordingly, I shall not delay the House further. It is ridiculous to tax a band entertainment, the proceeds from which are used for the building of a band hall. The entertainment tax causes considerable trouble. At times the right denomination of ticket cannot be obtained. I have experienced this difficulty myself, and I would rather pay the tax twice over than suffer the inconvenience caused through being made the unofficial collector of the tax for the Commonwealth. </para>

Cameron)</inline> dealt with amateur sports, but it is not possible to deal with that case at present, because of the difficulty of drawing a line of demarcation respecting public purposes. The case of the country band mentioned by the honorable member for Gwydir would probably come under the heading of public purposes. The majority of band instruments are bought by public subscription, and the band's activities are essentially of a public character. The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. O'Keefe)</inline> dealt with charitable entertainments. Section 12 of the principal act which it is proposed to amend expressly deals with that subject. It reads - </para>

If the whole of the proceeds of an entertainment are devoted to charitable purposes, it is exempt from taxation, but if the expenses amount to more than 50 per cent. of the takings, the tax must be paid.

                        <para>.- I differ entirely from the Treasurer. In the event of the expenses of an entertainment' exceeding the takings by 50 per cent., a tax will be imposed, and the commissioner under this bill will have no power to exempt the proceeds from taxation. The experience of the past few years has shown that in many cases this procedure has not worked fairly. The Treasurer should, at least in this bill give the commissioner a discretionary power, so that in certain circumstances entertainments for charitable purposes will not be taxed when the expenses amount to more than 50 per cent. of the takings. </para>

                        <para>.- I consider that imposing the entertainments tax on certain private dances is making taxation a fine art. Many small private dances are held in various halls by ten or a dozen people, simply because the participants have not a room in their own homes large enough for dancing. They contribute sufficient between them to pay for the hire of the hall and the pianist. It can hardly be contended that those dances should be taxed. If the entertainment of the Chautauqua party is exempt on the ground that it is educational, I submit that certain lectures which I have given on " Central Australia and the Northern Territory " should be exempt on the same grounds. </para>

Although I personally believe that the words "charitable" and " philanthropic " are wide enough to cover such entertainments, . they are not so interpreted by the departmental officers. The entertainments that have been described are really for provident funds. </para>

                            <para>- And why not? I take it that the entertainments tax is intended to apply to entertainments promoted for private profit, but not to other entertainments. Surely that is the principle that underlies the measure. If that is so - and I do not think any honorable member will contend otherwise - there should be no objection to accepting the amendment It is the duty of the committee to exempt from taxation entertainments organized for benefit societies. The loss will be very small, and should not be objected to. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope the amendment will be considered seriously, and that exemptions granted on the lines proposed will be general. A trade union organization that has its own hall and gives entertainments two or three times a week should not be specially exempted unless all similar entertainments are exempted. All entertainments that are not promoted for personal profit should be exempted. ' Entertainments promoted for the assistance of charities to raise funds for country football or cricket clubs, or purely for amusement, should not be taxed. </para>

                        <para>, - I see the danger of asking the Treasurer to do too much. Revenue has to be provided. The Government should abandon the entertainments tax entirely, for it was a war-time measure. Tha amendment seeks to exempt entertainments for assisting funeral, sickness, and accident funds. Such entertainments axe promoted for the purposes of benevolence or self help. To exempt dances and amusements is a different matter. Employees in an industry who seek to provide sickness, accident, and funeral benefits for their co-workers are not in the category mentioned by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> Although I am a member of the Labour party, I would be the last man in the world to  ask  the Treasurer to give special concessions to trade unions. I am not actuated by political motives. When m,en try by a small entertainment to provide benefits for their fellows in case of sickness or death, it seems more than paltry to levy a tax upon them. </para>
