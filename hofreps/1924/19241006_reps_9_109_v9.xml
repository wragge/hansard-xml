                        <para>- Some time ago, in a series of questions, I asked the Prime Minister whether the Commonwealth Line of steamships would carry on the fight against high freights now ruling in the interstate trade. The right honorable gentleman promised to bring the matter before the notice of the Commonwealth Shipping Board. Assuming that he has done so, I should like to know if he has yet received a reply from the board as to what its attitude is likely to be? </para>

                        <para>- On the 30th September, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> referred to the impending discharge of a number of employees at Cockatoo Island. I promised to make inquiries into the matter, and I now desire to inform the honorable member that the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board advises that in view of the early completion of the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Ferndale</inline> it has been reluctantly compelled to dispense with the services of approximately 670 men. The men embrace the following classes of workmen :  - Boilermakers, shipwrights, general assistants, plumbers, ironworkers, joiners, painters, fitters, electricians, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, crane-drivers, general labourers, and boys. The remaining staff of approximately 400 men will be more than sufficient for the work at present in hand. It is expected that the repair work in view at the end of October will absorb approximately an additional 200 men for a short period. As I pointed out on the 14th August last, in reply to a similar reference by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> there must of necessity be fluctuations in the number of men employed in ship construction and repair work where the volume of work is of a varying quantity, and honorable members will agree that it would be impracticable to maintain staffs at the numbers employed at the periods of maximum output. The management is, however, using its utmost endeavours to secure additional constructional and repair work, and in these efforts the Government is co-operating to the fullest extent. As a result of these efforts, it is hoped that it may be possible in the near future to absorb most of the employees who are, of necessity, being now discharged. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is necessary because the judgment of the High Court in the Cameron case indirectly affects assessments for the war-time profits tax. Live stock was valued on a basis which the court declared to be invalid and unconstitutional. Consequently, it is necessary to amend the law in the same way as it was amended by the Income Tax Assessment Live Stock Bill last week. The arguments used by me on that occasion apply also to this bill. The bill provides that the owner can return his stock at either its market value or the value that has been laid down and accepted. The provision for election is the same as in the Income Tax Assessment Live Stock Bill. There will be no appeals against assessments, so no special provision for that purpose, such as was included in the other bill, is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The election that might suit them under one measure might not suit them under the other. Those men who employ accountants to work out their taxes for them may want to make separate elections. An election for income tax for the future might have a quite opposite effect if applied to the war-time profits of the past. Whatever choice taxpayers make under one measure should apply also to the other. Assessments are still being sent out for war-time profits tax for the year 1916. That is a most extraordinary circumstance. I do not object to giving taxpayers a choice, because by the law of averages the tax will work out fairly over a number of years. In war time market values were probably  higher than they are now. I hope that the Treasurer will insert a provision in the bill that the election of a taxpayer in respect of assessment for income taxation purposes shall apply also for the purposes of war-time profits taxation. </para>

                        <para>.- I trust that the honorable member will not persist in his proposal, for I think that its adoption might inflict hardship upon pastoralists who were only establishing themselves when the war broke out. I am speaking on their behalf, . and not for well-established pastoralists, who can afford to pay their taxation. For the purpose of war-time profits taxation pastoralists were entitled to select any two of the six preceding years as the basis of assessment. Unfortunately for many -of the smaller men, the years preceding the war were very unprofitable. One man I have in mind, who spent £10,000 on a cattle st at ion bad not even had interest on his capital returned to him prior to the war. In the first year of the war he made a book profit of £1,200, on which he had to pay federal and state income tax. In the next year his book profits were between £4,200 and £4,500, on which he had to pay federal and state income and land taxation in addition to £2,250 war-time profits tax. </para>

                                business could not be classed as new, for it had been established for some time, though there had been no profit in it.

                            <para>- The war-time profits taxes outstanding for 1923-4 are only about £300,000, so that £700,000 is due in respect of the years 1916-7 to 1922-3. No one wishes to inflict hardship on struggling selectors, but this seems to be an extraordinarily large amount of money to be outstanding. The price of cattle has fallen considerably in the last few years, and I am not at all sure that we are justified in permitting pastoralists to adopt present market values as the basis of their assessments for the years covered by the bill. I admit that the price of sheep is still very high. Probably if the whole business were averaged, the taxation returns would be practically the same whichever of the alternatives were adopted. It. is quite possible, however, that, acting on expert advice, pastoralists may elect to have their ordinary income tax assessed on one basis, and their wartime profits tax assessed on the other. It is well known that not only in regard to grazing, but in respect of all rural pursuits, an army of lawyers, accountants, and taxation experts are at work advising their respective clients as to which is  the most satisfactory way for them to submit their taxation returns. I do not know whether that is being done in this instance. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> to explain whether this measure resembles in principle similar bills with which we have recently dealt, and whether its provisions are likely to be acceptable to the taxpayers concerned. I understand that certain taxpayers who declared the value of their live stock will now have an opportunity to choose the basis of valuation on which taxation shall be paid in the future. </para>

                        <para>. - In the Income Tax Assessment (Live Stock) Bill discussed last week provision was made for electing the basis for valuing live stock. The question at issue then was legislation in which three alternatives were provided for that purpose, and is quite different from that in this bill, or in the bill submitted in consequence of the judgment given by the High Court in the case <inline font-style="italic">Cameron</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for Tasmania.</inline> The two latter bills were necessary, as the existing law provided that the values of live stock should be "as prescribed." The values "as prescribed" were declared by the High Court in the Cameron case to be invalid, and consequently there were no. values upon which live stock could be taxed. The object of the bill to amend the act affected by the High Court judgment in the Cameron case and of this bill is to provide a basis of valuation for the period during which the departmental basis was invalid. Notwithstanding the judgment of the High Court, we believe the departmental1 valuations are fair. We are therefore giving taxpayers the opportunity to pay on them, or on the market value of the stock. </para>

                            <para>- There were no appeals under the act which this bill is to amend. I am satisfied that we are dealing fairly with taxpayers, and that they will allow the assessments to stand. The number of appeals under the other measure will be negligible. This bill is necessary to enable the department to issue valid assessments to safeguard the owners of live stock, and to protect the revenue. In view of' these facts, and the cogent reasons advanced by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> I suggest that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> should allow the clause to pass in its present form. As no appeal has been made against the assessments, taxpayers must be satisfied with the present position. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to submit an amendment which) will detrimentally affect any one. If a taxpayer considers that he has been harshly treated he can be dealt with under another clause; I understand the  amount of rebates granted under the Wartime Profits Tax Act is considerable, but in consequence of the difficulties mentioned by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> taxpayers have been generously dealt with by the Commissioner. In the validation of legislation which has been declared invalid, the owners of stock are to be given a choice; in other words, they may elect to accept the method of valuation which the High Court has declared to be invalid, or value at market rates. The Income Tax Assessment (Live Stock) Bill, passed last week, provides that once a stock-owner has made his choice, he must abide by it, and I contend that he should also be compelled to adhere to it for the valuation of his live stock during the war period. I submit that if he chooses the market value as a fair basis for future years, it should also be accepted by him as a fair basis for the years covered by the wartime profits tax. </para>

                        <para>.- A peculiar position is likely to arise in the taxation department when an officer examines the returns furnished by an owner of live stock for income tax and war-time profits tax purposes. He may find the stock valued in a certain way in the return furnished for income taxation purposes, and in another way in the return for war-time profits tax purposes. Why should it be possible to have two different valuations of the same stock in the same year? The only object I can see in two sets of valuations under two different acts is the defrauding of the revenue. If the taxpayer makes his choice of valuations it should apply to both the income tax and the war-time profits tax. </para>

The live stock owners would be limited in regard to the values placed on their stock to whatever method of valuation they elected to have applied to their stock for the future. Every one must recognize that during the war conditions were quite different from what they are today. Many stock-owners may have learned from experience the best method of assessing their stock. The adoption of the honorable member's suggestion would mean tearing up practically all the assessments now in the taxation office, and it would cost possibly many thousands to work out what each taxpayer should have paid under another method of arriving at the value of live stock. </para>

                <para class="block">It is customary to ask Parliament from time to time to vote lump sums for the payment of the pensions which are granted under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Up to the present time Parliament has voted for this purpose a total sum of £61,250,000. The actual expenditure to the 30th June last was £53,991,661, and this year an appropriation has already been made of £7,000,000, so that the total expenditure to the 30th June next will be £60,991,661, leaving an unexpended balance of £258,339. This margin of £258,339 is insufficient to ensure that moneys will be available for paying pensions falling due on the 2nd July next. It has been the practice for some years to pay into the War Pensions and Invalid and Old-age Pensions Trust Accounts the whole or portion of the surplus remaining at the close of the year, so that the moneys will be available for the payment of pensions in the following year. The Government trusts that there will be a surplus at the end of the present financial year, and we also desire to ensure the payment of these pensions at the beginning of the next financial year. Parliament is therefore being asked to grant an appropriation of £10,000,000. </para>

But in a measure of this nature, in which we are giving to the industry as a whole the right to control its own affairs, we must assume that the board of control will carry out its duties properly, and not that the whole of the five members on the executive will be representative of co-operative factories only. If that were to happen, it would tend to destroy a measure which those interested in dairying appear to be desirous of seeing placed on the statute-book.

                <para>At the time when the words "to  Europe"  were inserted, there  was  considerable doubt in the minds of honorable members, including myself, whether it would not open the gate too wide. Later, it was considered that we might add the words " and South Africa," but on examination we concluded that that would hardly meet the case. Our object was to exclude the eastern trade from the control of the board. That is an entirely different trade from our trade with other countries, and is at present carried out on an altogether different basis, the butter and cheese being nearly all exported in tins. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I believe that Australia has about 95 per cent. of the butter trade of the East. The Government agreed to this amendment originally in the desire to exclude that trade from the board's control, as it appeared neither necessary nor advisable that the board should control it. The Senate has concluded that the addition of the words " to Europe " would not achieve the desired object, and I think the committee should agree that that is so. If the amendment of the Senate is agreed to the Government proposes to meet the position by adding at the end of the clause the following words: - </para>

Java, Borneo, and all the islands north of Australia, including Fiji, will be excluded, but a line north of the 30th parallel of south latitude will leave New Zealand within the area to be controlled by the board. This amendment has been examined very carefully, and the Government believes that it gives effect to the original intention of this committee. Colombo is within the area to be controlled by the board. The board will have control over all ports that can be used for the purpose of avoiding the operation of the act by making dummy sales and shipments to them. </para>

                    <para>.- The area placed outside the control of the board will include Singapore, which is one of the biggest transhipment ports in the world. The practice adopted by dishonest shippers to evade the operation of the act by ostensibly shipping to South Africa and America will not be discontinued even under this amendment, because they will use Singapore as a port of transhipment, and reship goods from there to Great Britain and Europe via the Suez Canal. </para>

I think that the intention of both honorable members and honorable senators is that, wherever possible, the moneys held by the board should be banked with the Commonwealth Bank. The point was taken that, under the provisions of clause 22, moneys may be held at places where there is not a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. That could not apply to moneys held under the provisions of clause 24. I consider that,  wherever there is a branch of the Commonwealth Bank, any moneys held 'by the board should be deposited with that bank. </para>

                    <para>, -  Under the scheme for the anticipated financing of the industry during control by the board, it is contemplated that the&gt; Government will be asked to guarantee, up to 80 per cent, of its value, an immediate payment against the fruit that is placed in the hands of the board. We have haul experience of similar guarantees in regard to wheat. When large sums have been involved it has never been the practice of the Commonwealth Bank to carry the whole of the guaranteed amount. Generally speaking, that practice is not a convenient one. The business is done through the Commonwealth! Bank, which apportions it amongst the associated banks. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> can see the embarrassment that will be caused if only the Commonwealth Bank is mentioned in this clause. Unless it is provided that moneys may be paid into any other prescribed bank the guarantee provisions will probably be unworkable. Whatever views the honorable member may hold in regard to the patronage that should be accorded to the Commonwealth Bank, I think that he must agree that in this case it is absolutely imperative to allow some of the business to be done with other banks. </para>

                        <para>- That is all that the clause covers. Dried fruits will be placed in the hands of the board, and the board wilt obtain an advance against them from a bank; but the Government, will guarantee the bank up to the amount advanced. It is almost inevitable that a considerable number of transactions will be necessary, because of the financial position of the industry. The business could not possibly be handled by the Commonwealth Bank solely, and I feel sure that that bank would not desire the restriction contained in the clause as it went to the Senate. I therefore suggest that it is imperative to accept the amendment proposed by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- I find myself in somewhat of a difficulty in connexion with this amendment.?' These words were inserted at the instance of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> and the amendment was readily assented to by the Prime Minister when the bill was last before us. In connexion with clause 22, I can realize that in the case of moneys to be paid to fruit-growers in Mildura, where there is no branch of the Commonwealth Bank, the business might be done by arrangement with some other bank, but under clause 24, in the case of moneys received by the control board for the sale of dried fruits, I assume that in Victoria,, for instance, the whole of the business of the board would be carried out in Melbourne, and. there is no reason why its moneys should not be deposited with the Commonwealth Bank. Whether honorable members! favour the Commonwealth Bank or not, it has to be remembered that under legislation recently passed by this .Parliament that bank is working under a new system. Previous to that legislation, the Commonwealth Bank could devote one-half of its profits to strengthening its reserves, or to the redemption of its debentures, and if there was still a surplus of profit it would go into the Consolidated; Revenue. But we have now provided definitely that one-half of the profits made by the bank must go into the Consolidated Revenue. If by legislation this Parliament can extend the operations of the bank, the result will be that a greater amount will have to be paid by the bank into the Consolidated Revenue. Some distinction must be drawn between financing the dried fruits industry and financing the export of wheat or butter. I suppose that the value of the butter exported would run into £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, and I can understand that the Commonwealth Bank might desire that responsibility for so large a sum should be shared with other banks. The value of our wheat export would also run into many millions sterling, but the value of the export of dried fruits, or the total output of the industry would be comparatively so small that one bank might readily undertake the business. </para>

                        <para>- In dealing with wheat and wool, the Commonwealth Bank has been associated in its transactions with private banking institutions. I should think that the Commonwealth Bank would be prepared to handle this business to the extent of over £1,000,000, if it received payments made to the control board in connexion with the industry. Nothing has been said by the Prime Minister to-day to justify his change of opinion from what it was when the bill was previously before us. We are under an obligation to stand by the Commonwealth Bank as " the people's bank." I admit that that name is not now so appropriate to the bank as it was. In every bill recently introduced which deals in any way with banking, there is evidence of a desire to take the business from the Commonwealth Bank and give' it into the hands of private banks. </para>

The honorable member has just reminded us that under recent legislation half the annual profits made by the Commonwealth Bank must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> and his leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> stood at the last Federal elections for extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank in the interests of the people, and particularly of primary producers.

                <para class="block">Minister attempted to show that there was a connexion between clauses 22 and 24, and he argued that because it was advisable to insert in one clause the words " or any other prescribed bank," it was therefore advisable to insert the same words in clause 24. The two clauses are entirely different. Clause 22 applies to places where there may be no branches of the Commonwealth Bank, but it is beyond doubt that clause 24 refers to business that will be transacted in one of the capital cities. As one who wishes to see the functions of the Commonwealth Bank extended, and who views with alarm the constant clipping of its wings, I record my protest against the Government's proposal. The Commonwealth Bank would gladly accept the business. If the words proposed to be added are added, the Commonwealth Bank will not get the business. The treatment of the bank recently has been shameful. The State Governments bank money for the payment of public servants in private banks. That is deplorable, but it indicates the trend . of affairs in Australia to-day. If we desire that the business shall be done through the Commonwealth Bank, we should say so in no uncertain words. There is only one bank, and that is the people's bank, that has a right to do this business. The people of this country are finding the money for the scheme, and their bank should handle the business. The Prime Minister was at his worst when he was explaining his change of front. The matter may seem small to him, but to me every proposal that will give the Commonwealth Bank an advantage over private banks is big. I am unable to understand why the Prime Minister has changed his attitude. I shall call for a division on this motion, so that the people will be able to see which honorable members are friends of the bank. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems that the Government never tires of according special privileges to private firms, and that there is a deliberate sacrificing of public interests to the special claims made upon the Government by the agencies that no doubt contribute most liberally towards its support. The Government, without realizing it, is setting an example for future governments to follow in serving the interests of the great working class. There is little doubt that when future governments apply the policy of this Government to the working class, instead of fo the capitalist class, there will be screams of horror and suggestions of scandal. The Government continues to hand out gifts to these big interests., and makes no attempt to justify its action. The latest effort in that direction is the attempt to deprive the Commonwealth Bank of business that rightly belongs to it. During the last few months private banking institutions have received more consideration than is their due. They are permitted not only to get substantial rake-offs from the flotation of loan money, but also to manipulate - "manipulate" is a better word than " control " in the circumstances - the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank. The policy of the Commonwealth Bank is directed by, and is subject to the influence of, private financial corporations. The policy of the Government is to allow the Commonwealth Bank to function only along those lines that will profit the private banking institutions. The proposal now before the committee represents another attempt to give special consideration to private banking institutions, to whom it is proposed to give .business that should be transacted by the nation's bank. </para>

I do not agree that the Commonwealth Bank could not handle all the business of the Commonwealth. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Bank should not be the chief financial agency iri this matter, and, if necessary, should secure assistance from private institutions. This latest attempt to subordinate the Commonwealth Bank to the private banks is a further indication of the extent to which the Government is prepared to sell the rights of the people and of the public institutions of this country to its private friends in the financial, commercial, or great landed concerns of this country. </para>

                    <para>.- I am at a loss to understand the purpose of the Government in proposing the amendment. An amendment to this clause, moved last week by the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> to provide that all the banking should be done through the Commonwealth Bank, was accepted by the Prime Minister. Now we are told that he then agreed to do something that he did not intend to agree to. The only argument that has been submitted in favour of the amendment is that there may be no branch of the Commonwealth Bank where the business with which the clause deals will need to be done. But there is a branch of the Commonwealth Bank at every port from which fruit will be exported. The argument might have been valid had the amendment been proposed to clause 22, but it has no force whatever in relation to &gt;clause 24. The honorable member for Wakefield &lt;Mr. Foster) says, " Trust the board to do the right thing." I should be quite prepared to do that if past experience justified it. Unfortunately, however, the history of the Commonwealth Bank and its association with public bodies is thoroughly unsatisfactory, for the bank has been continuously boycotted. </para>

                        <para>- I .shall give the honorable member some instances, beginning with the previous Victorian Government, which has deliberately boycotted the bank. It does  im,ot  give tha bank the business of even one of its many departments. I suppose that not 1 per cent, of the muni,cipalities in this 'state have traded with the Commonwealth Bank until they have been forced to do so. I could name a number of municipalities which handle public money that have deliberately given the private banking companies' their business notwithstanding that better terms have been offered to them by the Commonwealth Bank. The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, the Harbour Trust, and a number of subsidiary public bodies have boycotted the bank. After die painful 'experiences of the past in trusting to public bodies to do the right thing, I am not prepared to accept the advice of the honorable member for Wakefield to trust this board. I can quite understand the reasons which have actuated the Government in proposing the amendment. It stands for private enterprise as against public enterprise, and for profit-making private concerns as against profit-making public institutions. </para>

                        <para>- I speak from experience. The Commonwealth Bank has offered better terms than the private banks to quite a number 'of municipal corporations and other public bodies; but it has not been given their business. The reason is, of course, that the members of so many of these public bodies have substantial interests in private financial institutions. The declared policy of this Government is to support private enterprise as against public enterprise. It is for that reason that it sold the Common-  wealth Woollen Mills to a private company at about a third of their value. A statement was made in Great Britain recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Dyer, the principal member of the syndicate which purchased the concern, that the mills were the best in the Southern Hemisphere, and were worth £350,000. The Government disposed of them for £150,000. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the view expressed by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> in regard to the boycotting of the Commonwealth Bank by public bodies. I regret that the managers of the branches of the Commonwealth Bank are not instructed to push for new business. A former manager of the Melbourne branch of the bank made no effort to secure new clients, but his successor did, and was instrumental in obtaining a large number of very good accounts. If the clause is left in its present form the Commonwealth Bank will not be precluded from operating in conjunction with other banks. In several instances public bodies have been practically forced to do business with the Commonwealth Bank because of the better terms offered by it. Some time ago the Melbourne City Council desired accommodation from the banking firm with which it had been doing business for many years, but the bank would not give what the council regarded as satisfactory terms. The Commonwealth Bank was then approached, and it immediately granted the terms which the council desired, on the condition that the council transferred its account to the bank. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> will remember an experience which was brought under the notice of the Public Works Committee some time ago, when inquiries were being made respecting a water supply for the Flinders Naval Base. The officers of the Victorian State </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Rivers and Water Supply Commission informed the committee that they did not know where money could be obtained to finance the proposition. A suggestion that the Commonwealth Bank should be approached was acted upon, and the bank without hesitation granted a loan of £160,000 at a satisfactory rate of interest, which made possible a water supply for Flinders Naval Base and Mornington Peninsula. Notwithstanding this, successive Victorian governments have not given any other business to the bank. I stated on the public platform on Saturday night that the people of Australia did not know what they owed to the Commonwealth Bank. That statement is true. I suppose that we have been saved not less than £40,000,000 during the last twelve years by the operations of and the existence of the bank. </para>

If, in the vicissitudes of politics, a party comes into power which seeks to harm this institution, the people may be trusted to deal suitably and speedily with it. The action in appointing a board to control the Commonwealth Bank does not in any way prevent the Government from seriously interfering with the work of this fine institution. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> will agree with me that the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works has declined to negotiate loans from the Commonwealth Bank at rates lower than those offered by other financial institutions. </para>

                <para class="block">It is my desire to raise the issue whether a lease granted by the Government of the Commonwealth or of a state for a term of years should be regarded as a chattel instrument, the profits from the sale of which should be considered as capital. When Parliament agreed to an amendment of the act, it was understood by many that it was the desire of the government to tax as income the profits received by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling hotel leases and other leases of that description, and not to tax money derived from the sale of pastoral and mineral leases. Under the South Australian acts, pastoral leases have been granted for 42 vears, but the usual term is 21 years, and leases of such land, when it is not required for other purposes, have always been renewed. The ordinary term of a mining lease in Western Australia is 21 years, with the right of an extension for a further fifteen years. Large sums have been spent in developing pastoral and mineral leases, and I do not know of an instance in which a government has resumed the land when the lessees have complied with all the conditions under which it was granted. Are we to understand that persons who purchase large areas of land adjacent to the capital cities, and who make profits of from. £50,000 to £100,000 on the transaction, can regard those profits as an accretion of capital, whilst a person who disposes of a mineral or pastoral lease on which he has expended very large sums for development cannot do so? We should decide whether we are to continue the policy adopted since the amending bill was passed some years ago. I think it was in 1916 that we determined to tax the profits made on the sale of leases. I am desirous of getting a decision as to whether the profit derived from the sale of a pastoral or mineral lease shall be regarded as taxable income. This bill has been brought in owing to the decision given in the Dalrymple case, and, apparently because what was desired could not be done by amending the Income Tax Assessment Act,  special legislation is necessary. I do not know how other honorable members view the Government's proposal, but my opinion is that the bill proposes a tax on capital. That being so, the principle should be applied all round, or not at all. </para>

                        <para>- This bill already imposes a levy on wealth. If a man takes up a pastoral lease and sells it, the income tax office will assess the value of the improvements effected by him1. The man who takes up a pastoral lease in what is thought to be an artesian belt may put down two or three bores before he succeeds in striking an artesian flow. How much of the expenditure thus incurred will be allowed to him as tangible assets belonging to the lessee? Will he be allowed only the amount expended on the bore that actually proved the existence of artesian water ? The whole matter is left to the " opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation " and the lessee is given no right of appeal against the Commissioner's decision. The Commissioner, of course, must depend upon the reports of his inspectors. It is an enormous power to give to these men. I have provided in my amendment for the exemption of pastoral, grazing, and mining leases granted by the Commonwealth and the states. If a man goes into the Northern Territory and spends his lifetime in building up a cattle or sheep station, and ultimately sells his property, he should be treated at least as well as, if not better than, the man who buys property in the city and sells it at a considerable profit. All the expert advice I have been able to obtain assures me that this bill proposes to tax capital and not income. If that is thought just, let us tax capital all round, or let theTreasurer accept my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- He is not taxed in most of the states, nor under Commonwealth legislation. I . can see no reason why the investor in city property should be given an advantage over the man who invests his money in a pastoral or mining lease. On the contrary, every inducement should be given to people to go into the back country and develop the open spaces of Australia. If we cannot give them an advantage over other classes of land-holders, we should certainly not put them in a disadvantageous position as compared with the others. I trust that honorable members will realize that this bill proposes to tax capital. Honorable members should either agree to my amendment, or make the profits on all land transactions equally liable to the payment of income tax. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has overlooked the fact that the sale of a lease must be taxed, because the Income Tax Assessment Act permits the purchaser of a lease to claim a deduction for the amount he has spent in acquiring the lease. It would be impossible to allow a deduction in both cases. Already there is discrimination between freehold and leasehold land, inasmuch as leasehold land is nob taxed for land tax purposes, whereas freehold is. Special provision was ' made in the original Income Tax Assessment Act to deal with the sale of leases, and the trouble that has arisen since arose through an attempt to extend the principle to a subsequent transfer or assignment. If we allow a deduction to the purchaser, we must impose the tax on the vendor. It must be paid by some one. </para>

                    <para>.- By making the profits on the sale of a leasehold taxable, we naturally increase the price paid for the property. When a person buys a lease, he buys it fully realizing his responsibilities. He knows that the lease has only a certain period to run, and ho pays a smaller price than he would pay if the vendor were called upon to pay income tax on the purchase price. Provision  i3  made in the Income Tax Assessment Act for the person who puts his capital into a lease to get a deduction each year during the currency of the lease. </para>

If he cannot make an income out of it within the unexpired period, the responsibility rests upon him. But why should the man who builds up a property be obliged to pay an enormous income tax, and particularly on the basis of one year's profit, though he may have held the lease for many years, in order to enable the next man to deduct so much each year because of the amount he was obliged to pay for the purchase of the lease? </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that it is fair ; I am merely pointing out what has been done without involving that issue. As a matter of fact, this tax was not imposed on leaseholds until the leaseholders themselves asked for a deduction, spread over the periods of the leases, in respect of the purchase-money paid by them. They regarded it as income expenditure, and if the amount paid for a lease is income expenditure at the time of the purchase, it must also be income at the time of the sale. The leaseholders themselves have rendered the position involved. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly it is. Another strange complication arises from the fact that a rebate is allowed for any covenanted improvements to which the lessee agrees. The freeholder ought to be taxed on them, but he is not. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of leases of premises such as hotels or shops. When the freeholder gives a lease to another person, and the tenant agrees to expend so much on improvements, the lessee secures a deduction for the amount he spends on those improvements. By the same line of reasoning, the freeholder ought to pay income tax on the amount he has received in this way from the leaseholder. It ought to be added to the rent and spread over the term of the lease, but it is not. Wherever we go, the freeholder has a better deal than the leaseholder. The point raised by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> must be considered. If we are not to tax these leases, we shall be obliged to get a refund on all the rebates that have been given to leaseholders on the prices they have paid for the leases they have taken over. If the principle is made to operate only one way, the revenue will suffer considerably. I have not heard what the Treasurer estimates the loss would be, but I should think that it would be in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Swan would increase the injustice, because it would result in further discrimination. He wishes to exempt pastoral and mining leases, but what about agricultural leases? </para>

                        <para>- We cannot separate the genuine cases from the others. If a man buys a freehold property and sells it at a profit, his profit is not taxed, but if his business is the buying and selling of property, the profit that he makes is taxed as income. Why, when a man who makes a profit by selling freehold property such as houses is not taxed on the profit he makes, should a man who sells a lease' be required to pay tax on his profit ? I claim that no distinction should be made between the sellers of freehold and the. sellers of leasehold property. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has repeated my own argument. In dealing with freeholds we clearly distinguish between the man who buys land and sells it at a profit, and the man who buys and sells land as a business, but we do not make that distinction in regard to leasehold property. Yet I confess that I find it very difficult to become dogmatic on the subject, realizing the consequences of the present practice. The whole matter has become involved through the action of leaseholders themselves, and, of course, they cannot have a thing both ways. Is it possible to trace all the money that has been lost in rebates that should not have been made ? </para>

We must remember that whether the rebate was legal or not it was deemed to be legal. If I am correctly informed, no. tax was imposed on profits from the sale of leaseholds until the rebate was claimed. </para>

                        <para>- There is another consideration. A royal commission threshed this matter out for a considerable time. If my memory serves me aright it came to the conclusion that the price paid for a lease was not an accretion of capital, but pre-paid rent, and there is much to be said in favour of that contention. Here is another complication. If a loss is made on the sale of a lease no allowance is made for that loss by way of deduction from the seller's income, but it is treated as a loss of capital. Why, I ask, is it not treated as a loss of income ? </para>

                        <para>- It is not fair to leave too much to his discretion. Some men make a living by buying and selling house property. They live in a house for a year or so, and then sell out, thereby escaping the payment of income tax on the profit. Others buy leases of businesses, and after a year or so sell out at a profit. A man may buy the freehold of an hotel, and, after building up the business, sell out for £20,000, obtaining £10,000 for the freehold and another £10,000 for the goodwill. He escapes the payment of income tax. If, on the other hand, the same man had purchased the lease of an hotel, and, after building up the business, had sold the goodwill at a profit of £10,000, he would have to pay income tax on that amount. That is the law which is now to be validated. In the case of the sale of an hotel that is freehold, not only is the increase in the freehold value to be regarded as an accretion of capital, but the goodwill also is to be included. The granting of a rebate of income tax was wrong in the first place, but we cannot remedy the trouble by retrospective legislation. I am satisfied that as much injustice will be done to the hotel lessee as to the pastoralist or mining lessee. Therefore, the amendment of the honorable member for Swan will not meet the position, </para>

                    <para>.- A few days ago we agreed to exempt from income tax sums paid for medical expenses. Previously, tax has been paid twice on the same money. For instance, if a taxpayer paid £100 to a doctor for medical expenses, the money would be taxed as part of the income of the doctor, and the person who had paid the money would not be allowed to deduct it from the amount of his taxable income, so that the Government collected tax twice on the same money. Whatever the nature of a  lease, the Government has the right to, and does, tax the owner if he makes any profit on the sale of it. That profit regulates the price obtained for it, and determines the earning capacity of the property. When the owner parts with his means of earning income, he sells his assets. The person who buys the lease is liable to be taxed on the income derived from it, and it is manifestly unfair for the Government to collect the tax twice. A man's lease may be his source of income. If we desire that this country shall develop both as regards mining and agriculture, we must act justly towards the people engaged in those pursuits. The case of the estate agent, who makes his living by the exchange of properties, is entirely different. He derives his income from the sale of property, and should be taxed on that income. When a lease is sold by the holder, it means that the seller has sold his means of livelihood to another, who, in turn, becomes taxable on income derived therefrom. The seller, should not be called upon to hand the proceeds of the sale, or any -portion of it, to the Commissioner of Taxes, because probably he will have to invest it in some other direction to continue to make a living. The cruel injustice which has been meted out to ' a section of our citizens has been a factor in retarding the mining industry. Honorable members should see the difference between the two classes of persons, and realize that- if the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is not agreed to, we shall be taxing two people on precisely the same money. </para>

                    <para>.- This amendment deals only with a certain section of leaseholders. There are others similarly situated.- The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said that estate agents who sell property as a business should be taxed on the incomes they deriVe from such sales, but there are others who buy and sell property, and make profits by so doing. Honorable members all know that it is not unusual for a man to purchase a property and live in it for a time, during which period he improves it, and then sells it at a profit. </para>

                        <para>- Yes : but he is not taxed on his profits, because he is not registered as an estate agent. A system which taxes the. profits derived from the sale of leasehold properties, and excludes from taxation any profits from the sale of freehold properties, is inequitable. But not only does the law discriminate between leaseholders and  persons  owning freehold property, but it is now proposed to discriminate between different classes of leaseholders. I recollect a case where a syndicate of three men took over the lease of a Melbourne hotel. Because of the improvements they effected and their manner of conducting the business, custom was attracted, and before long a profitable business developed. When the lease had still seven years of its original ten years to run, they sold out at a profit of £33,000. Do honorable members think that those men should have been exempted from taxation? In that line of business alone there are numbers of people who make considerable profits year after year. They are fair game for taxation. In this matter I shall have to support the Government, as I believe that if some leaseholders are ,to be exempted, all should be exempted. </para>

                        <para>- The " poor widow " argument has been used in connexion with nearly all legislation which has been introduced. When first we proposed to introduce legislation controlling shops and factories, we heard of the poor widow whose means of livelihood would be taken from her. No Parliament can satisfactorily, legislate for exceptional cases. The best that can be done- is to deal justly, so far as is possible, with the great majority of the people. Even when we do our best, we find that the legislation doe3 not meet every case, and that some still suffer. The honorable member for Swan may be pleading for a class of leaseholders who are in difficult circumstances, but if I vote for his amendment, and some other honorable member moves a further amendment to include practically every leaseholder, I shall feel compelled to vote for that also. At this stage I do not feel disposed to deprive the country of so much revenue. </para>

                    <para>.- The desire of the committee appears to be that, in connexion with a most difficult phase of taxation, we should try to do what is a fair thing. The Governmentproposes that the profits on sales of leaseholds shall be regarded as income, and not as accretions of capital. On the other hand, it is intended that we shall allow the amount paid for the lease to be amortized during the currency of the lease. I was very interested in the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> with which I was, to a great extent, in agreement. He put the case fairly clearly. We are not discussing this subject from a party stand-point, but with the idea of doing a fair thing by the leaseholders, and laying down generally fundamental principles of taxation that will equitably meet a situation which admittedly is extremely difficult to handle. The effect of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan would be to discriminate between leaseholders, because it proposes to exempt from the provisions of this bill certain leaseholds, but hot all leaseholds. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment, if carried, will further complicate the position, and I cannot see any reason for departing from a fundamental principle by differentiating between the profits from the sale of leases. Under the taxation proposals before the committee, a person who gives £5,000 for a ten years' lease of land is allowed £500 a year deduction from his income as rent or amortization until the lease expires. Therefore, if he sells the lease during its currency, he should certainly pay income tax upon any profit that he makes from the sale. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot follow the argument of honorable members who would not suspend the law whereby amortization can be annually deducted from incomes, and also contend that when a lease is sold at a profit it shall be regarded as an accretion of capital. It must be one thing or the other. It seems to me that the proposals of the Government are fundamentally fair and present the only practical way out of an exceedingly tangled position in respect of taxation of leaseholds. If deductions over the term of a lease are allowed, surely profits made from the sale of that lease should be taxed, and, alternately, allowance made for any loss incurred by the sale? </para>

                    <para>.- In this debate the outstanding difficulty is that all leases are spoken of as being of the same kind and quality. There are two reasons why a man leases instead of selling his property. He leases it either because it  is too valuable to sell, or because be cannot sell it. The Government leases properties because there is no other way of disposing of them, and also to develop them. </para>

When they purchase the lease they know perfectly well what chance there is of developing the land. It is no use trying to apply the same argument to a class of lease, which is of value only because of the development of the land and the improvements placed upon it, and to another class of lease which is so valuable that the owner does not care to part with it. I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan. </para>

                    <para>.- I must compliment the honorable member for Yarra for clearly outlining all the difficulties confronting this class of taxation. I cannot support the argument that the profit from the sale of a lease is an accretion of capital. If a man takes up a lease for 21 years, where does he stand at the end of that period ? He has nothing more than his right to the improvements on the property. When a man takes a lease from the Crown, he pays nothing except his annual rent. At the expiration of his lease, he has no accretion of capital at all. Even if he sells his lease half way through its term, it is not right to class any profit he makes from the sale as an accretion of capital. The amount that he receives from the sale, after deducting the value of the improvements, represents the increased earn ing value of the property just the same as if he had sold portion of the stock on the property. In addition to his lease he must have stock with which to earn his living. If any profits from the sale of his lease half way through its term are not to be taxed, then it is just as right to say that any stock he sells half way through the term of his lease should also not be taxed. The lease implies the right to use the property during its currency. The lessee pays for that right. When a lessee sells his lease to another person at a profit, the value of the property is evidently greater than it was when the rental was originally fixed by the Crown, and, as a natural corollary, one would expect the rent to be greater. </para>

                        <para>- Because of development and improvement. Many people think that a person taking up leasehold is in exactly the same position as one taking up freehold, but it is not so. Two people may take up land from the Crown, one freehold and the other leasehold. The man who takes up leasehold pays out nothing, but the man who takes up freehold pays a fairly large sum representing the value of the land. During the time he occupies it, he pays land tax, which increases as the land appreciates in value. The Taxation Department steps in and raises the unimproved value of the land, and the freeholder pays increased land tax, whether he makes a profit or not. On the other hand, a leaseholder pays nothing at all until he sells his lease. He is not taxed upon the total amount he gets for the sale; simply upon the profit. If he makes a loss on the sale he is not taxed at all. I have already spoken to the Treasurer, and I am hopeful that he will be able to devise some means whereby a lessee shall be free from income taxation in proportion to the loss on the sale of his lease. </para>

                        <para>- The committee has got into a very difficult position, but I suggest to the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that there is no ground for disagreement with the ruling of the Chair. This bill is founded upon a resolution passed in Committee of Ways and Means reported to the House, and adopted by it. To amend the bill now therefore would be to vary a resolution passed by the Committee of Ways and Means and adopted by the House. That is not permissible. It is obvious, however, that the committee would not wish to have a measure so important as this brought before it without having an opportunity to discuss it or to submit amendments of its provisions. I, therefore, suggest that the measure be again referred to the Committee of Ways and Means. It would then be open to the honorable member for Swan, or to any other honorable member, to move in that committee that it be an instruction to this committee on the bill to amend it in the direction desired by him. The delay would not be lengthy, and a difficult discussion upon a technical and abstruse question of parliamentary procedure would be avoided. I want to make it quite clear to the committee that the Government has no desire to take advantage of any technical point that has arisen. </para>

                        <para>-  Because of the importance of the principle involved, and in order that this Parliament shall not sacrifice any of its rights, I think that this matter should at once be decided. It would be an absolute farce if, after a bill had been read a second time, and the House had gone into committee to consider it in detail, honorable members had not the right to move any amendment of it. The principle is so important that the House ought to decide whether such a thing should be tolerated for an instant. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my duty to say whether the rules governing our procedure are absurd or ridiculous, as the honorable member for Swan suggests. They are the rules adopted by the House, and must be obeyed. The only way out of the difficulty is that suggested by the Prime Minister, that I do now report progress and that the House again go into Committee of Ways and Means to consider a resolution dealing with the details of the measure. </para>

                        <para>-It is perfectly plain that certain things are permitted at certain stages of a bill, whether it  originates in a message or in a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means. But if the Committee of Ways and Means reports a resolution to the House and the House adopts it, the resolution then becomes the resolution of the House upon which the bill is founded. When subsequently such a bill after the second-reading stage goes into Committee of the Whole as distinguished from the Committee of Ways and Means, certain strict limitations are placed' on the powers of the Committee of the Whole. I could not, at a moment's notice, undertake to strictly define those limitations, but it is obvious that they are of this character : that no amendment which in any substantial way varies the terms of the resolution upon which the bill was founded can be accepted, and particularly if it varies the terms of the resolution by altering the area of taxation, when taxation is involved, or by increasing the charges or levies upon the people. In such circumstances, such amendments are, distinctly forbidden by parliamentary practice. So strong has been the feeling in connexion with these measures, that for upwards of a century the House of Commons had only two standing orders, and these standing orders governed the House in its ' consideration of such measures. They prevented the Commons from augmenting the Supply when Supply was being granted and limited the power of the Commons, either in House or Committee to increase the levies which the Crown demanded. If there is any other matter upon which I can assist honorable members I shall be happy to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Are we to understand, sir, that when a taxation bill has been founded on a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means, no amendment affecting the scope of the taxation proposed can be made in Committee of the Whole House. The House, having adopted a resolution of the Committee ot Ways and Means, it would appear that the only opportunity afforded honorable members to amend the bill founded on the resolution, and subsequently presented, is at a stage before they have seen it. The resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means, of course, precedes the first reading of the bill. The bill cannot be circulated until it has been read a first time. Then it is read a second time, and is then taken into Committee of the Whole. At this last stage, which is the only stage at which honorable members, having seen the bill, have an opportunity to discuss its details, it is too late to make any . amendment in it. Is that the position? </para>

There is . one further point which I perhaps did nob make quite plain on that occasion, when I was called upon for a ruling without notice, and that is that if, when a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means is presented to the House for consideration and adoption, the House desires to alter it, it may do so. </para>

It is, I think, known to us that no amendment which would alter the area of taxation or increase the charges proposed would be permissible. I understand you to say now that the Committee of the Whole cannot alter the character or scope of the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means, but that amendments within a strictly limited area are permissible by the Committee of the Whole. I should like to direct your attention to the fact that the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> has ruled that no amendment of any kind is permissible in the bill which has been under consideration in the Committee of the Whole. </para>

The Temporary  Chairman  of Committees ruled that that amendment could not be accepted, because it would alter the scope of the bill. I accepted his ruling as correct, but I later desired to move a further amendment, which, if adopted, would not have altered the scope of the bill. The Temporary  Chairman  then ruled that it was impossible in Committee of the Whole for an amendment to be moved which would alter the bill in any way whatever. I should like to know whether that ruling is correct. </para>

                        <para>- Answering . first of all the inquiry of the honorable member for Swan, it must be within the knowledge of the honorable member that it is not the practice of the  Speaker  to comment upon rulings of the  Chairman  of Committees. The position of the  Chairman  of Committees would be impossible if he were to be overruled, not by the committee of which he was  chairman,  but by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> from another chair. On the question raised by the honorable member for Bourke, I thought I had made it quite plain that there are two occasions on which, should honorable members so desire, they may vary proposals before the Committee of Ways and Means. First of all, they may do so when the resolution is presented to the Committee of Ways and Means. They may do so at the second stage, when the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means is submitted to the House for adoption. If no alterations are made at either of these stages, it is quite incompetent for a Committee of the Whole House to make any variation in a resolution reported from the Committee of Ways and Means, and subsequently adopted by the House. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to have some information as to the procedure which should be followed if it is desired to vary the terms of a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means which has been adopted by the House. Must the resolution be again submitted to the Committee of Ways and Means before it can be altered ? I understand that it is proposed that the House should again go into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of varying a resolution of that committee, which has already been adopted by the House. I should like to know whether it will not, first of all, be necessary for the House to alter or vary its decision in adopting the resolution before it can be again considered in the Committee of Ways and Means. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not always so, but it is so in this case. The fact that the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means adopted by the House, and upon which the bill is founded, is, word for word, the same as the bill precludes the Committee of the Whole from altering any part of it. It seems . to me that it is unusual to frame a bill exactly in the terms of the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means upon which it is founded. If the bill were not exactly in the form of the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means, subsequently adopted by the House, I presume that the Committee of the Whole would have the right to amend it within certain limits. If the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means did not specify the details of the bill, would the House be permitted to amend the bill? </para>

                        <para>- That is a somewhat hypothetical case upon which it is difficult to rule. With the exception of the long title, the preamble, and the short title, the bill, as far as I can judge from a hurried perusal of it, follows the exact wording of the resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means upon which it is founded. There would scarcely be a general resolution for a tax of this kind ; but the effect of a resolution of the Committee of Ways and Means reported to and adopted by the House cannot subsequently be varied by a Committee of the Whole. Beyond that, I think, I should not be asked to comment at this stage. Some of the points raised have been suddenly sprung upon me, and they are so important that I may reasonably ask for time for further consideration before finally confirming the views I have expressed. </para>

                        <para>.- The object of the bill is to give the Public Service Board a legal standing in reclassifying the Public Service, so that any action of the board will not be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> if it should conflict with the decisions of the Public Service Arbitrator. The reclassification of the Service, of which the first part is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> No. 38, of 18th June last, is a scheme of wage reduction. It is an endeavour to relieve the Public Service Board of the necessity for obeying the awards of the Public Service Arbitrator. As it thus strikes vitally at the interests of public servants, and as this House has on previous occasions recognized the importance of observing a standard of wages and conditions which will lead to contentment and efficiency in the Service, we should give particularly careful consideration to this bill. Many features of it are distinctly undesirable, and during its passage through the House and the committee it will not be difficult to make honorable members realize that fact. The effect of the reclassification so far has been to lower the status of our public servants. The Public Service organizations have for a considerable time been endeavouring to improve the conditions of those employed in the Service, who have borne themselves with great patience, hoping that redress would be afforded by the awards, of the Public Service Arbitrator. After a delay of many months, for even the most simplified form of arbitration means delay, the Arbitrator delivered his awards, and the officers of the Service naturally felt that they would be able to enjoy the benefit of them. The hope was vain, for the reclassification has to a large extent nullified the awards. I may be told that the provisions of this bill protect the officers of the Service from salary reductions through the reclassification. My reply is that they are only protected while they continue to hold their present positions. They will feel the serious effects of the reclassification when they are transferred or promoted. A man may be occupying a position to-day the minimum salary of which is £250 per annum, and although the minimum salary for the next higher grade is £300 per annum according to the arbitration award, he may find when he is promoted that the reclassification has had the effect of reducing the salary to £260 per annum. It must be apparent to all honorable members who have given any thought to the subject that the sole effects of the reclassification must be to create dissatisfaction and discord in the Service, for it will deprive the officers of the emoluments they reckoned would be theirs on promotion. It has reduced status as well as salaries. The adoption by the Government of the policy of appointing outsiders to the best positions in the Service is also having a deplorable effect. Many brilliant public servants have been overlooked when important appointments have been made in the last two years. They have been shockingly treated. The failure of the Government to recognize the faithful and loyal service of our senior officers is having a disastrous effect upon the morale of the Service generally, and must tend to inefficiency and indifference. If we desire a contented and satisfied Service, we must deal fairly by our officers, and make the Service as attractive as possible. The pernicious system of filling the most lucrative and important public positions by the appointment of persons outside the Service deserves complete condemnation, and in adopting it the Government has been guilty of. a serious departure from what has always been regarded as the settled policy of the country. Among the important offices which have been filled by outside appointments more or less recently are the following: - Director of Navigation, salary £1,500; Director of Immigration, salary £2,0.00 per annum : Commonwealth Superintendent of Immigration, an office which has now been abolished, salary £1,500 per annum ; Assistant Director of Immigration, salary £900 per annum: Official Secretary to the Commissioner for Australia in the United States of America, salary £950 per annum: Commissioner to represent Australia on the Nauru 'Commission, salary £2,000 per annum; and Trade Commissioner in the East, salary £2,000 per annum.1 In addition, the Government has recently appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Casey, at a salary of £900 each, to important positions in the Department of Home and Territories, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sheaf</inline> has succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Little</inline> as Trade Commissioner in the East, at a salary of £2,250 per annum. We have smart and efficient . officers in the Service, who were capable of filling ' all these offices with distinction to themselves and to Australia. I am not criticizing the abilities of the gentlemen who have been appointed. I say nothing about that aspect of the matter. My complaint is that the offices should have been filled by members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and that the continual disregard of the claims of senior officers to the most lucrative positions at the disposal of the Government is having a deplorable effect upon the Service generally. </para>

                            <para>- That supports . the point that I am making. Our efforts should be bent towards making tha Service attractive. We are losing a number of our most enterprising and capable officers because the Service is not as attractive as it should be. On the other hand, many of our officers are sacrificing their prospects in the public interests by remaining in the employment of the Crown when they could better their positions by going outside. It is not only a poor appreciation of them to give the best paid positions in the Service to outsiders, but it is also inimical to the public interests. Nothing has clone more to defeat efficiency and interfere with satisfactory work in the Service than the factor which I have mentioned: and upon which I have enlarged in replying to the interjection by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister).</inline> In view of what is happening, I trust that Commonwealth public servants will receive, greater recognition from those responsible for promotions and transfers than they are receiving to-day. In view of the classification of the Service now proceeding, on which this bill 'has a direct bearing, as it validates the action of the board, it is necessary to ascertain the intention of. Parliament in regard to the status of officers and the Service conditions generally. In examining the first section o.f the classification scheme appearing in <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> No. 38 of 18th June, it will be seen that a distinct departure -has been made from a very important principle adopted by Parliament. </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">This bill seeks to legalize the action of the board, as in sub-clause 1 of clause 97 it is given power to make regulations for the specific purpose of arranging the second and third divisions into classes, under which the worth and merit of officers is not to be considered. Consequently, a serious position confronts many of our public servants. They are to be deprived of their status, as the new schedule abolishes all t'he classes and deprives the officers of the status and classification which they hold. This departure, which involves an important principle, is seriously perturbing the Service. On the 4th July of this year, I asked the Prime Minister the following question: - </para><quote>

                    </quote><para class="block">The Prime Minister replied - </para><quote>
                        <para>It is not clear what is meant by the honorable member's question; but he can rest assured that the Government have no desire to lower the standard of the Public Service. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">There is no obscurity in the Prime Minister's answer, although he declared that there should not be a lowering of the status of public servants, we find that the Government intend to reduce the status and salary of all the officers in the Commonwealth Public Service, with perhaps the exception of  those  in the first division. The public servants in the lower grades are to be seriously affected, and it seems that the lower the grade in which an officer is employed the greater will be the sacrifice which he will have to make. The Prime Minister suggested that my question was not clear; but there should be no obscurity in this matter. The question distinctly refers to the standard prescribed in the schedule of the Public Service Act of 1902, and which was confirmed in 1911. That schedule specifies five different classes of officers, and gives the salaries to be paid to public servants in each subdivision of each class. A very definite salary standard is also embodied in the schedule of the Public Service Act , of 1911, for which the Fisher Labour Government was responsible. That Government also increased the standard and improved the conditions of the Public </para><para class="block">Service as embodied in the 1902 act. The standard established in 1911, to which I referred to in my question, was adopted after considering the relative purchasing power of money. The classification now proposed will materially reduce the status of Commonwealth officers in all grades, and in consequence they are seriously perturbed. The first Parliament, which, of course, consisted of men holding widely divergent views, agreed that the standard should be sufficiently !high to attract the best men to 'conduct the business of the nation. They considered that the officers should have a personal value as distinct from the value of their work, and -enacted that they, as well as the offices they occupied, should be classified. It is proposed under this measure to dispense with the personal classification that is so important if merit and ability are not to be overlooked. The board now proposes to make it difficult for organizations within a division to so classify their members as to enable them to file a plaint with the Public Service Arbitrator. It is practically impossible for one plaint to cover the officers engaged in any one of the divisions in consequence of the abolition of classes or grades. Classification and future awards may cover a particular division, but it will make confusion worse confounded, as under awards given by the Public Service Arbitrator no public officer will know exactly what is the standard and status of the duties he has to perform. I trust honorable members will realize the difficulty confronting public servants, and the hopeless confusion that will be brought about when they present their claims to the Public Service Arbitrator or any other tribunal. In 1911 a different Parliament confirmed the standard originally fixed, and in doing so had regard to the reduced purchasing power of money. This standard is prescribed in the schedule to the 1911 act, and Parliament has never directed that it should be lowered. No mandate has ever been given to any one to reduce it. Those responsible for lowering the standard are breaking an implied contract with those who, after lue consideration, have adopted the Public Service for their life's work. I now propose to give sufficient data to enable' honorable members to judge for themselves whether the new classification reduces the standard. In order to make the position clear I shall give an illustration which can be readily followed, and, if necessary, checked from the records in the Library. I shall deal with the fifth, or the lowest grade of the Commonwealth Public Service. In checking these standards it is, of course, necessary to employ an official formula in respect of the fluctuating purchasing power of money, or cost of living, and in order that there may be no room for disagreement upon this highly important factor, I shall employ the formula adopted in the new classification for automatically adjusting salaries, namely, the Statistician's index figure for the cost of food, clothing, and housing in the six capital cities of the Commonwealth. Using as a basis the index figure of 880 for the year 1901, the index figure for the first quarter of 1924 is 1,695, or, in round numbers, 1,700. In the 1901 act the maximum prescribed for the lowest class in the Public Service was £160. Dividing £160 by 880, the index figure in 1901, and multiplying the result by 1,700, the index figure for 1924, the present maximum salary for the lowest class should be £309 a year. The reclassification sets it down at £276. The schedule provided in the act of 1901 continued in force until 1911, by which time the index figure had risen to 1,000. Dividing £160 by 880 and multiplying the result by 1,000, the index figure for 1911, the maximum of 1901, namely, £160, had risen in ten years to £181. In 1911, Parliament amended the schedule to the act, and raised the maximum of the lowest grade to £180. In paying due regard to the relative purchasing power of the sovereign, Parliament apparently adopted the formula upon which I am now working, and upon which the Public Service Commissioners have adjusted salaries in their new classification. But in 1911 Parliament, in addition to increasing the maximum to £180, inserted a special sub-section providing that officers on the maximum of the fifth class should be advanced by two annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £200. That is to say, it went beyond the basis set by the 1901 calculation. At any rate, the standard of 1901 was not only maintained to 1911, but also exceeded. That standard continued in force until the war, but the recent reclassification provides for a reduction of what was established in 1901, and confirmed in 1911. It is well for us to com pare the salaries paid to the Commonwealth Public Service with those paid to employees outside the Service. In 1914 the average weekly wage paid to adult male workers throughout the Commonwealth was £2 15s. 7d. In the same year the Arbitration Court delivered an award fixing the salaries of postmen at £3 2s. 4d. a week. In 1923 the average weekly wage of adult workers throughout the Commonwealth was £4 14s. 4d. Under the classification of the Public Service Board, the maximum weekly wage is £4 10s., whereas if the wages of postmen had been increased in proportion to the increases secured by adult workers outside the Service, the maximum would be £5 6s. 2d. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I say that the reclassification is a deliberate repudiation of the standard set up by the Arbitration Court. While Commonwealth and State Governments are administering arbitration laws, which persons engaged in private industry are compelled to obey, they are not themselves prepared to pay the rates of wages that private employers are expected to pay. The Commonwealth Public Service Board should set an example to outsiders. </para>

                            <para>- They should be. The new classification loses sight of the great principles followed by the first Commonwealth Parliament in giving the public servants personal status and value and a high-salary standard, although it was not as high as it should have been. The officers of our Service were even worthy of a higher standard than was given to them in 1901 or 1911, but nevertheless the salaries paid attracted many brilliant men and women to the Commonwealth Service. </para>

                            <para>- It was looked upon as a service that would provide any young man with a suitable career at a salary which was worthy of the position; but the officers are now finding that they are being deprived of those emoluments which induced them to join the Service. Upon the gazetting of the reclassification and its approval by the Governor-General, all allowances and increments that automatically become due to the members of the Commonwealth Public Service are absolutely discontinued. The salaries fixed by the Public Service Arbitrator are to be observed while officers continue to hold their present positions, but immediately an officer is transferred or promoted he draws the classified salary of the new position, and all the allowances and increments due to the office he leaves are to be discontinued. Can Ave imagine anything more calculated to create dissatisfaction and discontent in the Public Service than this, which the Government intend to make valid through the bill they are now asking Parliament to pass? So far, the principle of equal pay for equal service has been recognized, but under the reclassification of the Public Service Board it is to be seriously departed from, and many female officers with from 10 to 25 years' service are to have their salaries reduced by amounts ranging from £9 to £45 a year. It is a poor reward for those who have given a life service to the Commonwealth to find that, perhaps, when they are approaching their period for retirement they are not to be given the full salaries attaching to the positions they hold and given to males employed in the performance of similar, duties. The principle of equal pay for equal work was recognized by the Public Service Commissioner prior to 1914. and was confirmed by the Arbitration Court in 1915. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, in 1920, granted equal rates for salaries for males and females in the Australian Letter-carriers' Association, and during all those years the Public Service Commissioner raised no objection to the female members of that association receiving the pay drawn by the male members of the association. ' In 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke inserted a clause in the award in the case of the Australian Letter-carriers' Association that the salary received at that time by any member of the association, male or female, should not be reduced. In the same year also the Commonwealth Government granted an allowance of £12 a year to cover the increased cost of living, and no distinction was made between males and females in its allocation. It was left to the present Government to prompt, or, if not to prompt, to sanction and endorse a departure from the principle of equal pay for equal service. Under this amending legislation it will be possible for the permanent head of a department to make promotions and transfers within his department. If that is done, many officers who have served in other departments for long periods and who have undoubted ability will be overlooked. The permanent head of. the Home and Territories Department, for instance, has no knowledge of the attainments of the most capable officers in, say, the Postmaster-General's or Customs departments, but it will be competent for him to recommend for transfer or promotion an officer in his own department, without regard for the claims of those employed in other branches of the Service. That is a serious objection. Another feature to which I take exception is that the suspension of an officer of the second division can be effected by the permanent- head of the department. I claim that that power should be exercised only by the Minister. An officer of the first division should not be empowered to suspend an officer of the second division who is next to him in seniority. What manager in a private establishment would empower his foreman to suspend a sub-foreman or leading hand ? The manager retains that right to himself, knowing well . that it is possible for friction to arise between the officers immediately under him. When an officer is transferred from the fourth to the third class on probation, he is to receive the salary for the lower position, although he discharges the duties appertaining to the higher office. The department has withheld promotion for periods up to two years from men who have filled a 'higher office than that for which they have been paid. A year ago I raised in this House the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Mortby, who is a member of the Federal Taxation office in Adelaide. He was a fourth, class officer doing third class work on probation. From time to time he had applied for promotion, but it was withheld. I have repeatedly asked that a decision be given in his case, and I have not yet received satisfaction.  If that officer is still in the Service, I have no doubt that he is still receiving the same treatment. It is a scandalous way to deal with members of the Service. Had he been in private employment, his employer would have been brought before the court. </para>

But the time will come when justice will be done, lt remains for the Labour party to redeem the Government's broken promises, and I have no doubt that its action in lowering the standard of payment in the Fublio Service will receive the strongest condemnation. Honorable members should prevent the awards of the Public Service Arbitrator from being overridden or repudiated. Either the Public Service Board or the Arbitrator should be supreme. The members of the Service should not be under two masters. The speech by the Prime Minister on the second reading of the bill was marked by its brevity, no doubt because the measure has few redeeming features. I challenge any honorable member to justify its provisions. If honorable members desire to uphold the status of the Public Service and give it the recognition it deserves, they will reject the bill. </para>

                    <para>That the bill be now read a second time. The measure in no way infringes the principle underlying the Government's immigration policy, but provides for a number of improvements which have been suggested by the officers of the department who have been administering the principal act for some years. The bill, among other things, proposes to assist the administration in carrying out the law by providing the officers with greater facilities for applying the dictation test in a foreign language where necessary. At present that test can only be applied by an officer who is defined as such under the act. It is now proposed to insert certain words in the act which will not only allow an " officer " to apply the test, but will also enable him to authorize in writing other persons to do so. In distant parts of Australia it is sometimes difficult to find an " officer " under the act who can apply the necessary test in a foreign language. The bill also empowers the authorities to reject persons who, while not suffering from the diseases or disabilities referred to in the principal act, may, for other reasons, such as having insufficient means of support, be considered likely to become a charge on the community  If  admitted. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If it is thought that they are likely to become a charge on the public, the power to prevent their entrance to the Commonwealth will be exercised. The bill will also deal with passports. At present nearly all foreign passports have British vises, but it is now proposed that they must all have them, unless there is some reciprocal agreement between the Commonwealth and the other country concerned to dispense with that provision. The present law exempts members of ships' crews from the operations of the act while their vessels are in port in Australia, but that provision will cease to apply to them if they desert or absent themselves without leave during that period. Further, the bill proposes to provide a more effective way than at present exists of dealing with persons who gain illicit entry into Australia, or who, having been admitted temporarily under certain conditions, fail to observe such conditions. The bill also makes less cumbersome the procedure in respect of the deportation of persons who, within three years of their arrival in Australia, have been convicted of criminal offences, punishable by imprisonment for one year, or longer, or who become inmates of asylums. </para>

                            <para>- It is a provision extending the. old legislation in a way which the experience of the department has shown to be necessary. Where immigrants have been convicted and imprisoned pending 'deportation, they may, under the existing law, automatically obtain release on finding two sureties of £50each for their leaving the Commonwealth within one month. It is now proposed to make that release discretionary. It is also intended to remedy a weakness in the law respecting the prosecution of the owners or agents of a ship from which a prohibited immigrant has entered the Commonwealth in places where no representative of the firm is resident, and also to make provision for forms to be filled in by persons seeking to land in Australia. There is nothing else of moment in the bill. </para>
