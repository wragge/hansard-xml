                    <para>.- The subject of my motion is not new to the Treasurer, and ho must have expected some protest against the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell.</inline> The honorable gentleman cannot blame me or any other honorable member for occupying the time of the House with a discussion of this matter, because he is responsible for the action I have taken. I do not think he will be able to convince the House that he was justified in appointing-. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> to this important position. So far as I can learn, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> is not a member of the Public Service, and the appointment of an outsider to such a post as he is now occupying is unprecedented. This innovation is causing, some perturbation among members of the Public Service, who have a right to expect that when vacancies occur they shall be given such consideration as their positions in the Service entitle them to. It is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth that discontent in the Service should be caused by an appointment for which there does not appear to be any justification. I hope that the Treasurer will to-day allay the misgivings that exist amongst Commonwealth public servants, but so far he has not been candid with either the House or the Service. He has not carried out his promises, and I think I might fairly charge him with having side-stepped his obligations. Honorable members on this side of the House believe that in the Repatriation Department there is a desire to appoint military officers to positions for which they are not qualified by knowledge and experience; That objection applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell.</inline> Such a policy <inline font-style="italic">carries</inline> preference to soldiers to extremes, especially when public servants better qualified are sacrificed in order that appointments may be given to soldiers. We on this side of the House are opposed to the handing over of the administration of the civil pensions and maternity allowances to the Repatriation Department, and we do not think that that procedure is approved by the country.. The Repatriation' Department is more or less ephemeral, because we hope that in time all soldiers will have been repatriated, and there will be no further necessity for a Department to attend to that work. There is no reason why appointments such as the one in question should be made to the detriment of permanent members of the Public Service, and the Treasurer will require to adduce very strong reasons to justify his action in this matter.I suggest that, so far, he has been rather dis ingenuous. On the. 27th March last the following questions and answers were exchanged between the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> and the Treasurer :  - </para>

                <para>I may perhaps add, for the information of the honorable member, that, on the retirement recently of the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions, Adelaide, the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation in that State was appointed also as  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions.

The administration is being controlled as formerly by the Secretary to the Treasury in his capacity as Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions. </para>

Although <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> has been appointed, the Department is still under the control of the Secretary to the Treasury but the position has been given to a man outside the Service, who had no right to be appointed. The Treasurer's statement is of a character likely to lead some to believe that nothing irregular has been done, but the action taken is contrary to the usual practice, which is to transfer such officers from one State to another according to the importance of the work. A notification appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette on</inline> the 17th January, 1924, which was long before the honorable member for Dalley submitted the question. The Treasurer knew what had been done when the question was answered. He should realize that honorable members have their rights, and should be fully informed when information is sought.

                <para class="block">That is the information which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> supplies to an honorable member on a very important matter. He has created a precedent in having made an appointment which is not justified by the Public Service Act of 1922. Those who work under the provisions of the Act are very jealous of their rights and privileges, and I am informed that the action of the Treasurer paves the way for the making of similar appointments in future. I am not raising this matter at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayer.</inline> I have not spoken to that officer more than once. "When I went to the office to transact some business I was told to see him, and that is the only occasion on which  I have spoken to him. I have, however, conversed with other public servants, and I know that they expect honorable members to conserve the rights which they possess under the Act. <inline font-style="italic">If</inline> this appointment is not justified by the Act the Treasurer must explain why it has been made, and the reason for not referring it to the Public Service Board. The retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner</inline> enabled the Treasurer to put this policy in operation in South Australia, but prior to that it was known that some move was contemplated to bring the Pensions Department under the control of theRepatriation Department, and steps were taken to prevent its being done. The following is an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Public Service Journal,</inline> regarding a meeting that was held in Perth :  - </para>

                    <para>PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION DEPARTMENTS</para>
                    <para>Considerable discussion was evoked by the letter received from the general secretary regarding the rumoured amalgamation of these Departments; and, while the information supplied by the general secretary in connexion with the amalgamation issue was appreciated, it was considered by several councillors that the proposed move represented the thin edge of the wedge for the ultimate merging of the two Departments into one. Moreover, it was pointed out that, apart from amalgamation, the suggested appointment of an outsider, in the person of the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation, to the. important position of  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions, over the heads of better qualified permanent officers, constituted an injustice, and was directly opposed to the best interests of the Service. It was accordingly decided that the Central Executive he requested to strongly oppose the suggested appointment. It was further resolved to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Mann, M.H.R., to arrange for all the Federal members at present in Perth to receive a deputation on the subject from this branch, and that all the Western Australian Federal members who are not present at that interview should be circularized. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that the honorable gentleman could have been more candid than that. Judging by the nature of the appointment in South Australia, the probability is that another military man is ready to step into the position in Queensland. If that is contemplated, the Treasurer, this afternoon,, must show justification for it. I hope, however, that action will be taken by this House to prevent a repetition of what occurred in South Australia. I cannot believe that the Treasurer is able to make out a case which will justify the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell,</inline> and that appointment should be at once cancelled. If, as is maintained by members of the Public Service, this appointment is the thin edge of the wedge to break down the present system of making appointments and giving promotion, this House should take action to compel the Treasurer to revoke the appointment and give the position to the officer who is entitled to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayer</inline> entered the Public Service in 1881. He was transferred from the Postmaster-General's Department to the Pensions Department on the 18th March, 1911. I am led to believe that he is a capable officer, against whom nothing is known. Yet he has still to sit back. Another feature of the case merits earnest attention. I believe that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayer</inline> had been given this appointment, which 1 consider he was entitled to, all the other officers of the Department would have been promoted. They, therefore, are much concerned, and from their stand-point the matter is serious. I do not think that the Treasurer was justified in so coordinating the administration of our civil and military pensions. I do not propose to say anything about <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell's</inline> administrative ability. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> has dealt with two matters, namely, the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> to the position of  Deputy  . Commissioner of Old-age and Invalid Pensions in Adelaide, and, also, the general impression, which seems to- have been fostered by certain questions directed to me by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> that the Government propose to supersede the old-age and invalid pensions administration by repatriation administration. I shall reply briefly on both those matters. The Government's intention with respect to pensions administration generally is exactly the reverse of what seems to have been suggested by the questions asked by the honorable member for Dalley. It is the intention of the Government gradually to place the payment of the permanent repatriation pensions, of which there are now a large number, in the hands of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department. This will effect' a considerable economy, for the old-age and invalid pensions system of payment' is well established throughout the Commonwealth, and is a suitable channel through which to pay the permanent repatriation pensions. </para>

                        <para>- Ever since I have had charge of the repatriation administration I have been endeavouring  to co-ordinate the work of the Pensions Branch with that of the permanent Pensions Department of the Commonwealth. For instance, when the  lease  of the premises occupied by the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department in Sydney  expired,  we transferred the Department <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> to the repatriation building, and thus saved £2,250 per annum in rent. Ultimately the problem  Gases  now being dealt with by the Repatriation Department will decrease, and it will be possible to pay all the permanent repatriation pensions through the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department. Every week 100 repatriation pensions are being made permanent, and eventually they will all be paid in the way I have indicated. In working towards this end the Government are trying to arrange that such soldiers as are able to handle the work shall discharge the duties appertaining to both the Repatriation Pensions and the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Departments. I need say no more on this matter except that this has been the policy of the Government ever since I assumed control  'Of  repatriation work. One reason why that portfolio was placed in the hands of the Treasurer was that it was felt that that would lead to economy and more satisfactory service. The honorable member for Adelaide truly remarked, and I think all 'honorable members in the House will agree with him, that- the permanent officials in our Pensions Department have rendered thoroughly satisfactory service in dealing with tike claims that have been placed before them. When I visited Western Australia in February, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Mann)</inline> introduced a deputation of pension officers to me, and I expressed to them the view which I have now expressed to honorable members. I must confess that the relevance of the questions asked by the honorable member for Dalley has now dawned upon me for the first time. I did not appreciate the fact that a member representing a New South Wales constituency was dealing with an Adelaide case. </para>

                        <para>- I informed the honorable member for Dalley, in reply to his questions, that the Government policy would be announced at the appropriate time. When the honorable member asked me whether the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> had been made, by the Public Service Board, I replied that it had not, foi the reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gardiner,, the ex-Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in South Australia, had not been so appointed. The administration in South Australia of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gardiner, the South Australian Public Service Inspector, from 1909 to 1923. He acted in consideration of an allowance of £100 per annum. There has never been a  Deputy  Commissioner in South Australia who devoted the whole of his' time to pensions administration, and  the administration has thus been far less expensive than would have been the case had a full-time public servant, drawing the usual fairly high salary, been in charge' of the work. The South Australian method of administration having been found  to be most satisfactory, it was determined to continue it, and <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell,</inline> the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation in that State, was instructed to take up the invalid and old-age pensions duties in addition to his repatriation work. The appointment was peculiarly suitable, for invalid and old-age pensions work and repatriation pension activities have many features in common. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> is discharging the duties for both Departments at the .remuneration he formerly received for repatriation work only.  His  salary is £650 per annum. Honorable members will realize that it is possible for him to do the work required by both 'Departments on account -crf the repatriation work having declined so" considerably. </para>

                        <para>- It has, for the work is now being done in one building instead of in two. Similar savings are  practicable in other States, but cannot be effected immediately. I hope, however, that before very long we shall have the old-age and invalid pensions and repatriation pensions work amalgamated. When that time comes, savings, comparable with those which have already been made in Sydney and Adelaide, will result. No one will suggest that there has been any victimization through the new arrangement. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> officer has been prevented from advancing in the Service. No new office has been created, because the position rendered vacant by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner</inline> was not a full-time office. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer has claimed that the contentions put forward by the honorable member for Adelaide are not in accordance with the actual circumstances of the case he has submitted, but either he has been misinformed by his advisors, or the Department has displayed inexcusable ignorance. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> instance, the Treasurer was quite incorrect in saying that in South Australia, repatriation matters have been transferred to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department. As a matter of fact, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions work in Adelaide has been transferred to the Repatriation Department in Pulteney -street, and it is now under the direct supervision of an officer who, for some years, has occupied and still occupies the position of  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation, and is paid his salary for that position. Therefore, in Adelaide the very reverse of what the Treasurer now tells us is the policy of the Government has taken, place. The administration of invalid and old-age pensions has been transferred to the Repatriation Department, and the  Deputy  Commissioner of Repatriation is now the  Deputy  Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions. It is regrettable that the Treasurer, when replying to the questions asked by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Mahony), did not indicate the intentions of the Government in this respect. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but the Treasurer could certainly have given the House the advantage of this knowledge at a very much earlier date than he has. The appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> has given serious concern not only to officers in. the Commonwealth Service in South Australia, .but also to the Public Service of the Commonwealth generally. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> has mentioned the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Claver</inline> who has been in the service of the State of South Australia and of the Commonwealth since 1881, and it is possible other officers in the Commonwealth service are senior to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayer,</inline> yet these trusted officials have been passed over and a position is filled by a man who is really only a " Johnny come lately," and is not temperamentally fitted to supervise the administration of invalid and old-age pensions. Feeling that I could not get sympathetic treatment for the cases that came under my notice concerning the Repatriation Department, I have not for the last two years personally interviewed and submitted claims to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell,</inline> preferring to bring them under the notice of the Department in Melbourne. I was always able to go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner</inline> or Mr  Clayer whenever I had a matter which concerned their department. </para>

                        <para>- Because in my early experience as a member of this House I had occasion to interview him, and I then realized that while he might have many excellent qualities, he was not temperamentally fitted to deal with claims for pensions. He may be a most admirable officer in other directions, but I hav6 always felt that I would not secure from him the sympathetic treatment which the cases I might have to bring under his notice would deserve. I knew that in Melbourne I would be dealing with men who would be more sympathetic. If I could not have sufficient confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> in matters concerning returned soldiers - and he is a returned soldier himself - how could I expect that he would deal sympathetically with invalid and old-age pensioners, and to properly administer a Department of which he had had no previous experience ? The appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell</inline> is unfortunate from the stand-point, not only of the Commonwealth Public Service, but also of those who are compelled to submit to him claims for pensions. I shall not put a single claim before him ; I shall have nothing whatever to do with him. </para>

It is in keeping with what I might have expected from him, and justifies the opinion I have formed of him. I repeat that I am not prepared to take cases with which I may be entrusted to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bell,</inline> but shall bring them to the Central Office in Melbourne for consideration. Many of those cases, no doubt, should be determined by the local authority, but I have not sufficient confidence in the gentleman concerned to take that course. He has not had sufficient experience in these matters, and knows little or nothing about the Service. I feel that I should not be doing justice to those people who come to me concerning their claims for old-age and invalid pensions if I were to place them before the present  Deputy  Commissioner in Adelaide. This procedure will mean that, by the circumstances created by the Government, I shall be required to press additional work upon </para>

These include part use of workshops, stores accounting and issue, transport, &amp;c. The present basis of organization of No. 1 Station, Royal Australian Air Force, Point Cook, therefore precludes the possibility of assessing the total cost of No. 1 Flying. Training School separately from that of the other units located at Point Cook. </para>

                            <para>The Tariff imposed a certain duty on " rubber sand boots and shoes " in those words. The question is whether a shoe with a solutions rubber sole and a distinct rubber heel is, in fact, a " sand shoe." If it is, the sand shoes duty applies; but if it is not, the Department has not the power to charge duty as a '' sand shoe," as such duty would be contrary to the Tariff Act. The interpretation of the item hitherto has always been to confine it to the article commercially known as a sand shoe, but expert opinion has been and will be further sought as to whether the Department could justify a wider reading of the item. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government originally raised this question with the States, and at the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held last year a motion was agreed to affirming the desirability of uniformity of public holidays throughout the Commonwealth. I am glad to say that with the exception of one or two days, e.g., Labour Day, which is at present observed on different dates in various States, the efforts to secure uniformity have been successful. Correspondence is still being carried on, and it is hoped that, as far as practicable, complete uniformity in this direction will be secured. </para>

Regarding his further request that the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Ferndale</inline> be postponed from the 12th to the 14th of June, I am advised that it would be impracticable to launch the vessel on Saturday the 14th, as the launching of vessels is governed by the phases of the high spring tide. High tide is very late in the day on the 14th June, and in the fading light very serious risk would be incurred with a ship of such large tonnage. </para>

                    <para>.- When I spoke on this matter in July of last year I advocated that the absurd practice of using Roman characters for the numbering of the volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> be discontinued, and that Arabic numerals be employed instead. That change having since been adopted, my object in speaking to the motion has been attained. I regret the absence at the moment of the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> whose principal desire, in submitting the motion, was, I believe, to ' insure that parliamentary authority existed for the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Parliament has never specifically authorized the publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The fact that we pay for <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> may be held to be parliamentary authorization, but that conclusion is open to very grave and great- doubt. Every member of Parliament should be free to express his ideas in Parliament. He should be free from the danger of charges of libel. He should be free of the terrible menace of clever legal minds, able to twist his words with the object of ruining him. This might be done if a member was opposed by a wealthy' Combine or Trust. I hope that the House will support the motion of the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> and end this absurdity for all time. It should be made quite clear that any man who comes into this House as a member may speak as fearlessly as can a member of the House of Commons - the Mother of Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>. - This motion was moved by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> about this time last year, before the House had had an opportunity of considering the Budget proposals for increases in the invalid and old-age pensions. It proposes that any person making a statutory declaration that he or she  i3  insufficiently fed, clothed, or sheltered, shall, as soon as possible, and until relieved, b"e paid 15s. a week, with an additional 10s. for each child. Apparently the chief object of the honorable member for Melbourne is to provide adequate relief for all those who at the present time do not come within the operation of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. He desires to make it as easy as possible for needy persons to obtain allowances. I assume that the allowance would be granted in a similar way to the Compassionate Allowance formerly provided in the State of "Victoria. That was an allowance granted on the recommendation of a member of Parliament, a clergyman, or any other person of repute. Since then, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has been passed, and has come into operation throughout Australia.  The motion proposes a distinct departure from established systems of pensions administration. The Government recognizes that the present system is faulty in many respects. It is built on a wrong basis, and in order to correct it, a Royal Commission to inquire about national insurance, old age, invalidity, and unemployment was appointed. That Commission  13  now taking evidence. I submit that this question can be properly considered by this House when the report of that Commission has been presented. I assume that we shall then go into the whole question of unemployment and invalidity. The experience of the Old-age Pensions Department is that it is very dangerous to grant pensions on the unsupported statement of persons that they are destitute. This is shown by the fact that since 1909, 47,000 claims have been rejected, and practically all of them were supported by statutory declarations. They were rejected because an examination of the facts proved that the statutory declarations were not accurate. It is reasonable to assume that the claims were lodged in good faith. Had they been dealt with by the method suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne, the full pension rate would have been paid in a large proportion of them, although probably many of the applicants were substantially well oft'. A grave objection to the honorable member's proposal is that it would make the Commonwealth Government liable to serious imposition. Applicants for relief under the present system are compelled to disclose all their' circumstances, and the Department has full power to investigate their .,tate111 ellts. Despite these provisions many claims are received from persons who misrepresent facts in order to obtain pensions to which they are not legally entitled. The adoption of a. system requiring the applicant merely <inline font-style="italic">to make</inline> a, declaration, would give rise to a large number of applications, many of which would, no doubt, be genuine, but some of which would be from applicants undeserving of assistance. It is proposed that the applicant himself should decide whether he is insufficiently clothed, fed, and sheltered. This is a very wide qualification to be decided by a personal opinion. A person might make an honest declaration that he was insufficiently clothed, fed, or sheltered, and might, nevertheless, be in a position of 1 average comfort. Deserving persons who find themselves in destitute circumstances can generally attribute their condition to one of three causes - old age, invalidity, or unemployment. Those who are destitute on account of old age are already provided for by old-age pensions. For those who are permanently invalided there is similar provision. There remain, therefore, those <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> are temporarily incapacitated, and. those who are unemployed. I submit that the House would be acting unwisely if it came to a decision on this motion before the Commission which has been appointed to inquire into the basis of insurance for unemployment and sickness, presents its report. We have no statistics sufficiently accurate to estimate the cost of giving effect to the motion. There are 210,000 persons' over 65 years of age who are not receiving pensions. If a general invitation were extended to them to apply for pensions, and if only half of them applied, the cost would be over £5,000,000 a year. It is almost impossible to estimate what would be the cost of providing unemployment relief on the basis proposed. I should say that, at' the least, it would be £10,000,000 a year, which would bring the Commonwealth liability for relief, in this form up to £16,000,000 or £17,000,000 a year, or £2 18s. per head of the population. Such an estimate does  not  take into account the cost of administration. Even at the present time the cost of administration is moderately heavy, but under a system such as that advocated, with the necessity for detecting cases of imposition by people not actually destitute, it would bc much heavier and more complicated. There would have to be an enormous increase of staff, and additional expenditure. The adoption of the proposal at Che present juncture would be a leap in the dark. We would not know where we should land. Until the subject has been investigated by the National Insurance Commission, which is doing very valuable work, I ask the House to allow the motion to be postponed. </para>

                        <para>.- The plea of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> for the postponement of this matter until the report of the Commission on Unemployment and Insurance comes before the House, is in accordance with the usual policy of the present Government, that all matters of an im-' port. ant nature should be held over. In effect, th3 Treasurer says, " Let people de unemployed, and let starvation and distress take its toll of human life." I  contend that the appointment of that Commission was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to shelve this matter. They hoped that the Commission would not present its report during the life of this Parliament. The economics of the Treasurer are those of the stone age. They are the same as those of a British Prime Minister who ssaidd that assistance could not be sent to the starving Indians, because that would be against the laws of political economy. That is  ai  policy of <inline font-style="italic">£</inline> s. d. - the policy followed by the financial institutions of the world. True economics take3 into consideration the human beings who constitute the nation. The people of a country should be considered before its finances. No nation is truly wealthy which has among its citizens both millionaires and paupers. It is only in having a sturdy and virile people that a nation oau be considered rich in the true sense of the word. This country is capable of supporting ten times its present population, but what do we find ? In our midst there are 10,000 persons unemployed, and little children who are unable to obtain sufficient food. We should not tolerate: any system which allows even one child to ask in vain for food . I commend the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> for bringing this matter forward. Parliament should pass the. motion, which would be a step worthy of emulation by other nations. I protest against the callous attitude adopted by the Treasurer when dealing with this important question. He attempted to brush it aside lightly by saying that some one might sign a false statutory declaration. We all know that perjury is committed every day of the week, but- do we abolish our law courts because of that? The motion reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That does not' mean that relief shall automatically be given to any person who signs a statutory declaration. The statements contained in the declaration should  first be verified, and opportunity should be afforded for any cases of imposition or malingering to be detected. Even if this motion fails to receive the support of the House on this occasion, I hope the day is not far distant when a Commonwealth Government, representative of the whole of the people, will endeavour to do something to relieve these constantly recurring periods of distress. In his book, <inline font-style="italic">The Case for Labour,</inline> the late Prime Minister (Bt. Hon. W. M. Hughes) stated definitely that unemployment and destitution are the direct result of the capitalistic system. He said, further, that the capitalistic system should  pay  for the distress it causes. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that these evils are the fault not of the individual, but of the system which renders unemployment inevitable. It is  all  very well for people to say that industry cannot stand the burden of paying for unemployment. Industry can stand it. The millions of pounds paid out each year in dividends, and the huge wealth piled up in this country, bear eloquent testimony to the fact that industry can well afford to pay a special tax for this purpose. We cannot afford to wait until this roving Commission, which sits but a few hours a week, has finished its work. There is sufficient evidence already at the disposal of Ministers to enable them to introduce  a  Bill to-morrow to deal with this matter, if they desired to do so. But while the present Ministry is in office, it is hopeless to expect that anything satisfactory will be done. I am not con tent to wait, as the Treasurer has suggested. Of what use is that to the people who to-day are practically destitute? It is idle to tell destitute people that the Government intend to appoint  a  Commission to report, next year, or the year after, on the question  of  a destitute allowance. It is. wanted now, and if the motion is carried by the House, immediate effect should be given to it. </para>

                            <para>- A National Government increased the pension. It is all very well for the Opposition to criticize the Government. An ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory. We, on this side, have not abused the Opposition for their inaction. In considering this motion, we must ascertain whether our finances permit of an increased payment to old-age  and invalid pensioners, who may, possibly in the near future, obtain further benefits as a result of the deliberations of the National Insurance Commission. The motion proposes to allow statutory declarations to be made by certain officials who, in actual practice, are not concerned with public funds. It is not necessary to go outside the Public Service to find responsible men capable of deciding whether certain persons should be given a destitute allowance. We might just as well include union secretaries among the secretary of a branch of any National party in Australia. But these men are not responsible officers. . For eight years I occupied the position of union secretary, so I know what I am talking about. I should not like to have the responsibility of deciding who should and who should not get an allowance. I, and other honorable members, have claims made upon our purses for various donations, and we assist as far as it lies in our power to do so. Among the officials mentioned in the motion are school-masters, who may be most excellent people. </para>

                            <para>- It is common knowledge that honorable members opposite hope to attain the Treasury bench after the next election. In that case, the motion, if carried, may later create a very awkward position by forcing the Labour party to borrow money to give effect to it. I believe that the mover of the motion will agree with me that this important question of a destitute allowance should be referred to the National Insurance Commission for inclusion, if thought fit, with proposals affecting invalid and old-age pensions, and national insurance, now being investigated by that body. It has been stated that the National Insurance Commission should make a world-wide inquiry, and that at least some of its members should be sent overseas in connexion with its investigations. I do not support that proposal, because we have in the Commonwealth sufficient data from various countries of the world to show what they have done along the lines of national insurance. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable members for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> and Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> that the matter dealt. with in the motion is one of very great importance, and concerns a good many people. The question raised is so big, that I do not think the House should be asked to endorse the motion without investigation. I believe that the honorable member for Melbourne is very keenly interested in the people who would be assisted if his proposal were adopted, but he would be well advised to consent to the matter being dealt with upon a report from the National Insurance Commission. That Commission was appointed to review the system of old-age and invalid pensions, and to see whether it is not possible for us to give old, invalid, and destitute people the assistance to which they are entitled. I feel that it would be better and more in the interests of the people concerned that the amendment should be carried, and the Commission should report on this matter to the House. I could not support the motion without further information. It is not, I am sure, intended by the mover of the motion that monetary assistance should be given to any man or woman who displays no desire to work. I feel sure that the members of this Parliament will not do anything that would encourage people -to be lazy. . The honorable member for Melbourne is actuated by a higher motive than that. But whatever the object of the motion, the question it deals with is one which the Commission should investigate. We would, probably, as a result of its investigations, be furnished with some estimate of the number of people in the Commonwealth who are in a destitute condition through no fault of their own, and the probable expenditure involved. It may be said that the motion has appeared on the notice-paper for some weeks. </para>

I have not given it sufficient consideration to justify me in voting for it in view of the public expenditure which its adoption would involve. The question dealt with is really a branch of the question upon which the National Insurance Commission was appointed to advise this Parliament. If we dealt with it now, without further information, that might be regarded as a snub to the Commission. </para>

                <para class="block">It has long been held by the architects of Australia that every Australian architect should be given a fair chance to compete for the preparation of the plans for Government and other buildings and works in the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, because of nepotism, which I challenge any honorable member to equal in Australia since parliamentary procedure has existed here, one large institution in the Commonwealth has not adopted this course, and the architects of Australia have not been given a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>- The preparation of the plans for the note printing office was one of the most infamous jobs ever perpetrated in this State or in Australia, but I shall deal with that more particularly later on. In view of the fact that a majority of Protectionists has been returned to Parliament after Parliament of the Commonwealth, it is clearly the desire of the people that we should adopt a Protectionist policy, and that Australian work should, as far as possible, be done by Australians living in Australia. I have to thank the Institute of Architects, the Employers Association, and the  President  of the Chamber of Manufactures for much of the information I propose to submit in support of my motion. But I have to thank the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for having tried to expose these dealings, which I shall be able to prove by copies of sworn declarations setting forth the reasons for the nepotism practised by the late Governor of the Bank. To those honorable members who may ask why I speak in criticism of one who has passed away, I reply that, loving Australia, and desiring to see justice done, I have a duty to speak the truth. If anybody can impugn the accuracy of any statement I make, I shall take it as a personal favour if he will do so, and I shall, on proof, readily withdraw it. I desire to prevent a repetition of the improper practices of the past. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> tried to get the information which would supply the key to the nepotism that it knew was being practised, but not even the then Prime Minister could supply the facts. The Governor of the Bank was made by this Parliament a dictator, and could do what he chose with the funds deposited in the Bank. Honorable members' will agree that the continued silence of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, in spite of the efforts of the <inline font-style="italic">Age to</inline> have the facts made public, indicated his guilt. The first instance I shall quote is that of the Note Printing Office, in Victoria-parade, Melbourne. Plans of a new building for the note-printing works were prepared by departmental officers and submitted to the Public Works Committee. The estimated cost of the building, including all engineering services, was £4.4,200. In addition, there was an estimated expenditure of £1,600 for laying the electric mains, and £2,000 for moving and installing the machinery, making a total of £47,800. The investigations by the Committee disclosed the possibility of saving £1,000 by an alteration in the floors. That reduced the total estimated cost to £46,800. Shortly afterwards the control of the Note Printing Office passed from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank, and the result was that all the plans' and quantities which had been prepared by the Department at great cost were thrown aside, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's relatives - the Kirkpatricks, his cousins, 'and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller,</inline> his son - were commissioned to prepare a new plan at a huge cost. I endeavoured to-day to get particulars of the additional cost that was entailed by that change, but the Minister could not supply them; he must wait upon the sweet will of the Acting Governor of the Bank. Notwithstanding that the Public Works Committee had recommended a building more complete than was asked for by the Note Printer, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank was not satisfied. Yet any architect would say that the recommendation of the Public Works Committee was justified. On the 13th July, 1922, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> asked these questions of the then Treasurer - </para>

Since the recommendation was made by the Public Works Committee in 1019 that a Note Printing Office erected in Victoriaparade, Fitzroy, the Australian note issue has been transferred to the' Note Issue Department, of the Commonwealth Bank, and the site on which it is proposed to erect the new building has been purchased by the Bank with the object of building premises suitable for note printing. It is understood that plans of a new building have been prepared by the Bank's own architects, - by the Governor's own relatives - but no particulars, such as those asked for by the honorable member, have been supplied to the Government by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                <para class="block">At that time we did not know the relationship of the Governor of the Bank to members of the firm of Kirkpatrick and Sons. In connexion with the War Service Homes an even greater infamy was perpetrated, as the result of which the soldiers of Australia were robbed for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's relatives. I find in a laudatory article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific Australian</inline> on the 5th March, 1.924, that the Commonwealth Bank had purchased 5,179 homes, and 987 building blocks, and had erected 1,777 houses. A question I asked the other day elicited the fact that for architectural services in connexion with those homes £48,917 was paid to the Kirkpatrick firm, and 2,892 separate plans were prepared. Any decent firm of architects in Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide would prepare twelve sets of plans at a fraction of that cost. </para>
                <para class="block">The Victorian State Savings Bank, which is erecting more buildings than the Commonwealth Bank ever erected, would have rendered the same service for approximately .£§,900. A fight took place between the Governor of ' the Commonwealth Bank," the Auditor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Israel,</inline> and the then Commissioner for War Service Homes,  Colonel Walker.  I once attacked  Colonel Walker  because 1 thought he had done wrong, but in this matter he was absolutely right, and if he had had his way the unfortunate soldiers would have been saved at least £42,000, which was paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's relatives. Could there be a graver instance of nepotism? But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller was not ashamed of what took place, because he knew how difficult it was for members of Parliament or the public to learn the facts. I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashworth, President</inline> of the Victorian Employers Federation, for evidence of the relationship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller to the firm of Kirkpatrick and Sons. Honorable members may think that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashworth</inline> is an architect he is biased, but he retired from active practice nearly two years ago. He is quite unbiased, and only a strong sense of duty has caused him to reveal these facts through the columns of the Press.

That the Governor of the Bank <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir "Denison Miller)</inline> has some capacity as an. organizer may be admitted, but whether or not his capacity in that direction is exceptional is open to question. In most bankers of standing, organizing capacity may bo taken for granted. The more serious question arises is the Governor a really big banker and a big man ? Leaving <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison's</inline> standing as a scientific banker to experts (popular opinion on this question is worthless unless based oh expert judgment) the most important question of all remains - does he possess that keen sense of personal honour, so essential to the discharge of his high public trust? Any member of the public is entitled to ask this question if he can advance facts tending to show that the Governor is lacking in this indispensable qualification. </para>

                <para>Assuming this to be correct, what is the position of the Governor? On the one hand it is his duty to hold the architects responsible for their failure by dismissing them from the service of the Bank. On the other hand, personal interest in the members of his family may induce him to excuse the failure. ' No person holding a position of public trust should allow himself to be placed in such an invidious position. It is a fundamental legal maxim expressed in the law of agency and trustees of every description, including members of Parliament, that there shall be no conflict between interest and duty. Persons holding offices of public trust must be free from the most remote suspicion of using their positions to advance the interests of members of their family.

Kirkpatrick, but to obtain as soon as possible the birth certificate of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller.

                        <para>- Then I have been wrongly informed. I have before me the platform of the Liberal Union, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> of article 3, which reads: " Investigation into the policy of the Commonwealth Bank." The union's manifesto also contains these words: " Refusal to ascertain and publish the facts underlying the aspersion of nepotism cast upon the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank by questions in Parliament." If a public inquiry into this matter were held, a gentleman of high repute in Sydney would prove that when Kirkpatrick was failing, and the Institute of Architects would not admit him as a member- </para>

Kirkpatrick asked this gentleman to go to his cousin, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, and to be advised by him. He went to the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who requested this man to keep him on his feet until work could be given him. He did so, aud supported him to the extent of £1,500. Later, his helper went to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller and explained the position, and the reply he received was: " I am not answerable for his position." This gentleman, whose name could be disclosed, said: "What am I to do with the £1,500 worth of IOU's which I hold?"

The architectural work in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank's activities and a large number of War Service Homes was given to this firm, although many reputable architects rendered service to their country, not only in Australia, but abroad, during the Great War. Every member of the firm of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackett,</inline> who was  president  of the Institute of Architects, was a member, enlisted for service overseas, and even the lady typist in the office served as a nurse.

                        <para>- Yes, as shown by the dirty IOU's which I have produced, and which have never been honoured. Why are Chubb's safes exclusively  used in the Commonwealth Bank? I intend to submit a list of those using safes made by a firm in Sydney 'and Melbourne, which, I am sure, can make safes and locks equal, if not superior, to those manufactured by the firm of Chubb. Here, again, there is a relationship between the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the Chubb Company in England.

                <para>Is it true that some relationship exists between a prominent officer of the Commonwealth Bank and the manufacturers of the safes supplied to the Bank? </para>

                <para>We have to own receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst. and note contents with much interest. </para>
                <para>We cannot, of course, state any actual reason why the Commonwealth Bank gives preference, to Chubb's safes over the Australian-made article. We can only presume reasons for this attitude, and our treatment by that institution certainly justifies our presumptions. In no instance has a single letter, which we have addressed to that Bank, been favoured with the merest acknowledgement, which is, we are glad to say, an unique experience. </para>
                <para>When consideration is given to the fact that we attend to and supply all the safes and strong-room doors for the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, that we do the bulk of the work for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, and that we number among our clients the A.B.C. Bank, the Queensland National Bank, the Bank of Adelaide, the London Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Works and Railways Department (supply of all strong-room doors for post offices, &amp;c), the Postal Department, the South British Insurance Company, the Queensland Insurance Company, the A.M.P. Society, the Perpetual Trustee Company, Grace Brothers Limited, Henry Jones and Company Limited, Taylor Brothers Limited, Prouds Limited, the Fresh Food and Ice Company Limited, the Coastal Farmers Co-operative Society, the Australian Gaslight Company Limited, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (Waratah), the Fiji Government Treasury, the London Assurance Company Limited, &amp;c, &amp;c, the utter indifference shown by the Bank to our claim for even a hearing is hard to justify. </para>
                <para>The matter is one that causes us some concern, most particularly when we know it is the stated policy of the Federal Government to give preference to Australian-made goods. </para>

                <para class="block">In our case, as the list of the above-mentioned clients indicate, there cannot be any question as regards the security we can supply; in fact by reason of the patent " Protex Anti Explosive Lock," we can substantiate our claim to afford better security than any other maker can provide, also we can sell, quality for quality, at a much cheaper rate than any of the well-known English makers of similar lines. We are prepared to make any class of security up to the very highest grade of bankers' requirements, and are always prepared to put our products up for test against those of the same class made by any other manufacturers. As an instance of the class of work we turn out we would mention that we are now supplying to an important city bank one main bank vault door, oxy-acetelyne resisting and drill proof, with lobby and watertight door, and one main bank vault door, oxy-acetelyne and drill proof, with lobby and water-tight door at rear. These doors are the very latest in strong-room door construction, and possess features for security that no other door in any bank in the city can show. There can be no question of our not being able to supply what the bank requires, because we are prepared to supply anything that they may require. </para>

                <para class="block">I have shown as clearly as one can, what I set out to prove. This evidence has taken some years to collect. Not even the mighty power of the press is sufficient to destroy the force of that admission. Imagine the way in which a good up-to-date lawyer would handle this matter if he had the opportunity to cross-examine on it. Some honorable members may have read a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Circulating Sovereign,</inline> published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Scott, whose knowledge of finance must have impressed any one who has had the privilege of knowing or even of meeting him. In March, 1921, a public meeting was held in the Sydney Town Hall. At that meeting a committee was formed on which were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott, Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> J. Ryan, and others. It was decided to call on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, the meeting believing that, as he had full control of the money power of Australia, his influence would be sufficient to solve the unemployed problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers was somewhat timid about calling on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> considering that such action might constitute a slight on members of Parliament. He, therefore, did not accompany the committee at that time. In the July following, a public meeting was held in Martin-place, Sydney, and on Thursday, the 7th July, at 3.30 p.m., Messrs. Scott, J. K. Powell, Geo. Waite, H. S. Cohen, H. Pritchard, W. C. Atkinson, H. S. Humphries, and A. G. Hume waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller. A representative of <inline font-style="italic">The Daily Echo</inline> subsequently interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> to obtain particulars of his meeting with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> and his report appeared in the issue of the 16th September, 1921, from which I now quote. He asked him - " How many of the deputation were Australian Labour party members? " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> replied, " Five, and I hope all good Australian citizens . . . but what has that to 'do with it ? . . . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller received us just as a good Australian might be expected to receive a deputation of citizens. Two lady shorthand writers from the bank staff were present, and recorded what happened. Each deputationist spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> the thoughts, that each had. I was not interested in academic problems. We had certain machinery in existence, and I wanted an acknowledgement from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> of the power of that financial machinery, and an expression also from him of his willingness or otherwise, to use the power already existing. I asked ' What is the power of the Commonwealth Bank to finance Australia ? ' He said, ' This bank is just as powerful as the Australian Commonwealth is.' I said, ' <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> you did finance Australia for £350,000,000 for war purposes, and had the war continued, you could have financed it to another £350,000,000 for war, is that not so? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> replied, ' That was the case.'  Then, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,'</inline> I said, ' Are you prepared to finance Australia for £350,000,000 for productive purposes ? * He replied, ' Yes, I will do my best.' I said,. ' Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> ; that is the point.' I wrote down what had occurred, and read it back to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison,</inline> stating at the time that I only wanted what he would endorse, as the matter would be made public, and he replied, ' I will endorse that.' " </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline>
                    had had several interviews with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline>
                    prior to that occasion, and he had others subsequently. The tenor of those conversations was whether, in order to organize Australia productively,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline>
                    was prepared to advance the same amount of money that he claimed to have advanced for war purposes.  His  answer to one deputation was that if the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth approached him on the matter he was prepared to do it.

                        <para>- I have no desire to run counter to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> I have proved my point up to the hilt. I wanted to show whether he was willing to help Australia to remove for ever the curse of unemployment. I must, in justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "Walker,</inline> whom I attacked in this House, state that if his advice had been followed instead of that of the Commonwealth Bank, the unfortunate returned soldiers of Australia would not have been robbed of a large sum of money for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's relatives. I hope I have made that plain to the House. The fee of the State Bank is from £3 3s. to £4 4s. That charge is inclusive of plan and every other item. Any architect of standing will tell honorable members that the Bank has twelve complete sets of plans. If a. man wants a house built he is asked to choose one of those twelve designs. What was the practice followed by the Commonwealth Bank? If the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific Australian</inline> be accurate, it issued 2,892 plans, and built 1,777 houses. Cannot honorable members see how this practice benefited the Kirkpatrick crowd all the time? They drew £24 for every plan. Honorable members, surely, cannot support that kind of thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashworth,</inline> in a statement in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the 9th June, 1921, said, on this matter - I was present at a meeting of the Victorian institute of Architects when the first plans for War Service Homes, prepared by Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Miller, and those prepared by the architects of the War Service Homes Department, were discussed. Every member who spoke condemned the Kirkpatrick and Miller's plans and approved those of the Department. </para>

                </continue><para class="block">In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> I think I should read a letter written by him to the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. It is as follows: - </para><para>War Service Homes Commission, </para><para>Headquarters, Melb., 18th Aug., 1920. </para><para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para><para>I am in receipt of yours of 6th inst., No. 20/8866, covering copy of communication addressed to you by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the payment of architects' fees. My attitude in this matter was fully disclosed in the file bearing on the subject recently forwarded to you, but as you desire advice concerning the points raised by the Governor of the Bank, I should like to point out that the Conference referred to in the first paragraph was attended by the  Hon.  W. A. Watt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Mr. Collins,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, and at no time was I present. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller states, however, that the Conference was attended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt, Senator Millen,</inline> and another Cabinet Minister. Although I was not present at this Conference, I do not think that the question of architects' fees was dealt with ; but, if it was, I am quite sure that no arrangement was made by the Minister for 31 per cent, to be paid. Further on, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller states that " the Bank always understood that' the architects' fees were to be paid by the Commissioner, and not by the soldier." </para><para class="block">It-is ever so much easier to collect fees from a Government Department than from individuals. If the soldiers had known that they would have to pay £24 each for architects' services, which they could have obtained in the .ordinary way for £4 ls. or £5 5s., they would have complained immediately. The letter proceeds - </para><quote>
                    <para>In this connexion, I desire to refer to the notes of an interview between the Governor of the Bank and myself on the 31st July, 1919, in which the following remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller are set out : - "The charges would be revised .periodically, and, if it was found that, <inline font-style="italic">as against the soldier the charges are excessive . . . ."</inline> This statement was quoted to the Governor in my communication of 9th September, 1919, and was not questioned in any way by that gentleman in his reply dated 15th September, </para>
                    <para>As you probably gleaned from the file itself, the decision to charge the cost of preparing plans, specifications, &amp;c, to the . soldier applicants was not departed from by me all through; and I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's present statements that I concurred in some other arrangement. On several occasions, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller mentioned, I had interviews with him on the subject, and when requested to pass the various claims submitted by the Bank's architects, I refused and referred to my correspondence on the subject, also, stating that under no circumstances would I .permit the employment of architects On a percentage basis. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">That shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker</inline> was absolutely against engaging architects on a percentage basis. The letter continues - </para><quote>
                    <para>This decision, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller flatly declined to recognize, and on more than one occasion stated that under the agreement he had power to do what he chose in this matter. - </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline>
                    Miller was a dictator. Whenever it was a case of Miller against the Department, Miller had his way, and used his power for the purpose of benefiting his relatives. The letter goes on as follows : -
                </para><quote>
                    <para>This attitude is directly opposed to that adopted by the Bank within the last few weeks, when a number of incompleted contracts were thrown back on the Bank by certain contractors owing to  their  financial embarrassment. These could not be completed without certain loss resulting, and this loss the' Governor strongly contended should be borne by the Commission on the ground that the Bank was acting as its agent. </para>
                    <para>As 'to the final paragraph of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's communication, you will notice from the file which you have under review that from the very  outset I strenuously opposed the charge of 3J per cent., taking the view that this was excessive. This view was brought prominently to the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller at several interviews and at one I mentioned, in explanation of my attitude, that 3} per cent, might be a fair charge by a private architect for the preparation of plans and specifications for a single house, but that 3} per cent, in respect of each of many plans and specifications of standardized design was exorbitant. This view I still hold, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller declined to use the type plans and specifications prepared by the Commission, he, nevertheless, used type plans and specifications prepared by his own architects. As to the reasonableness of this charge you have not yet arbitrated, and I regret that I do not share the view that there is no necessity for its determination. The matter, to my mind, is of paramount importance, for as you have decided that the cost of preparing plans, &amp;C, shall be borne by the soldier applicants, it follows that such applicants will be required to accept the charge of 3J per cent., which is considered excessive as compared with the Commission's charge of lj per cent, for similar services. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">It is very clear from that letter that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker</inline> fought against the imposition of unreasonable charges on the soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller charged the soldiers six times more for the architectural work in the construction of their houses than is charged by the State Savings Bank for work carried out under the Credit Foncier system. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's relatives - Kirkpatrick and his son - benefited by this exorbitant charge. </para><interjection>

For a long time I was unable to obtain any information from the Minister about the charges which would be imposed on the soldiers. On page 6200 of the 1920-21 <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my remarks respecting the Kirkpatrick firm are reported -as follows : - </para>

                    <para>I have been unable to get an answer from the Treasurer as to how much money has been paid to this firm. In all my 30 years of political life I have never seen anything so nearly approaching nepotism. Why cannot our brave returned men of the profession have an opportunity to compete for the design of the proposed new Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne? Why should this work be given to one particular firm ? I asked if any member of that firm had offered his services during the war. The Minister could not tell me. I do not say that he did not want to know, but, as head of the Department, I should like to know why he did not make an inquiry and And out. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">As an old banker, I may be forgiven for reminding honorable members that one bank frequently grants to another bank favours of which the customers and shareholders of the respective banks know nothing. I admit that the Commonwealth Bank was established by a Government of which I was a whole-hearted supporter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley was really the father of the Commonwealth Bank, but it was not established according to the plans he laid down. He desired to provide for a Board of seven directors. Each State was to have appointed one representative, and the Commonwealth Government was to have appointed the seventh member of the Board, who was to have been the  chairman.  Had that plan been followed, all the business of the bank would have been consequent upon an absolute majority decision of the directors, and the War Service Homes trouble would not have occurred. I hope that this Government will not appoint another Governor of the Bank while Parliament is in recess. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not think they will do so. I hope, also, that the Government will see that all Australian architects have opportunities to compete in the preparation of plans for public buildings. </para><interjection>

                <para class="block">The line which I think should be constructed would stretch' for 297£ miles from Oodnadatta, the present rail head, which is 688 miles north of Adelaide. The many discussions that have taken place on the North-South railway have made honorable members fully acquainted with the' reason which prevented the South Australian Government from continuing the railway line beyond Oodnadatta, and thosese honorable members who have been fortunate enough to go as far north as that inland town know that the line ends in one of the poorest parts of Central Australia. However,  the  country shows a wonderful improvement beyond the boundary line between South Australia and the Northern Territory, about 140 miles north of Oodnadatta, and althoseugh the rainfall is only from 6 inches to 8 inches per annum, a very slender reed for pastoralists to rely upon, ample water can be obtained at shallow depths throughout the country from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I understand that at the latter place the evaporation is 94 inches as compared with S3 inches or 35 inches at Adelaide, but no attempt has yet been made in the neighbourhood of the Macdonnell Ranges, to conserve water as it has been conserved in the Riverina district of New South Wales and in the Wimmera district of "Victoria . As a matter of fact, I understand that in the whole of this area stretching for' 300 miles, there has been only one dam constructed. The Commonwealth has'' had control of the Northern Territory for about thirteen years, and it is not creditable to the administration that no attempt has been made to secure proper data of the rainfall and the possibilities of water conservation in this part of' the Territory. It may be said that I.- am asking the Government to build a railway to a place where there is no settlement or any. possibility of having settlement, but having given the matter a fair amount of study by reading the various Government reports, and having had  an opportunity to discuss this country with men who have spent ten, fifteen and twenty years of their lives in it, and having seen the country myself, I have come to the conclusion that with a railway, the centre of Australia would become a wonderful asset to the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman, who is described as the cattle and sheep king of Australia, has assured me that he knows of no better climate in the world than that which is to be found in the Macdonnell Ranges. Some honorable members declare that no cattle king of Australia has ever lived on his land, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman was bred in the interior, and has spent about twenty years in the country of which I am talking. The Macdonnell Ranges, the height of which varies from 2,000 feet to 5,000 feet above sea level, cover an area of a greater size than the State of Tasmania. Over a period of twenty-eight years, prior to 1920, the average rainfall in this part was 11 inches. Phenomenal rains of over 22 inches have fallen during two seasons since-then, but those figures have not been taken into account in arriving at the average of 11 inches. Honorable members who saw the photographs displayed in Queen's Hall last week will realize the possibilities of water conservation in the ranges. For the expenditure of a few thousand pounds the Government could very easily determine whether the country will hold water, and what the rate of evaporation is. I suggested last year that something should be done to secure this data, but the Government said that they had sufficient information on hand. It is remarkable that when the Departments are asked to supply accurate data of the rainfall in this portion of Australia, they cannot give the figures, except for Alice Springs, and, perhaps, the Hermannsburg Mission Station. I doubt whether there is sufficient data available in regard to the rainfall at Arltunga, in the eastern portion of the ranges, where there is a police station, and I am sure that beyond the Hermannsburg Mission Station, to the west, where there is land fit for selection, no attempt has been made to get this information. </para>

                        <para>- They run for 400 miles from east to west, with a slight turn to the north-east, and they are 70 miles across. Central Mount Stuart is 2,600 feet above sea level. The whole of the country has a height of not less than 2,000 feet above sea level. The feed is excellent. I honestly believe that the statement made by the honorable member for the Northern Territory, that the centre of Australia will carry, if not one sheep to the acre, at least one sheep to 3 aeres, was a fair one. Prominent pastoralists have told me that it is a fair estimate under ordinary conditions. The year when members of the Public Works Committee passed through that country was most exceptional, so far as that portion to the south of the ranges was concerned, but north of the ranges the season was an ordinary one. I understand that the rainfall has been nothing out of the ordinary this year, when a visit was made to that country by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> and the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline> both of whom were astonished at what they saw. Just to the north of the ranges lies Burt Plain, 95 miles across, and as far as the eye could see it was at the time of our visit covered with wonderful feed for sheep and cattle. But it is useless to talk about raising sheep 300 miles from a railway. The only way in which sheep can be made a success in the centre of Australia is by providing a railway, and enabling people to get their goods at reasonable prices. The main requirement for pastoralists who are breeding sheep is wire netting. I do not know that honorable members fully realize the cost of getting goods into the centre of Australia. The average cost of conveying goods from Adelaide to Oodnadatta is £10 or £11 per ton, and the minimum charge from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is £17 a ton by camels, with a 50 per cent, increase for petrol or bottled goods. The carriers, who are mostly Afghans, give no guarantee that they will deliver what they are carrying in good order, but through Divine Providence things are mostly landed in good condition, although at Christmas time, 1920, the camel teams took it into their heads to lie down in the bed of the River Finke, and the flour and sugar they were carrying, particularly the sugar, were delivered in solid lumps. With £28 or £30 a ton for carriage added to the cost of the wire netting or wire required for fencing, honorable members can see how impossible it would be for a small pastoralist to make good in the interior. To-day I was shown by a gentleman who had casually picked up the first volume of the <inline font-style="italic">CommonweathHarsard,</inline> that there was a reference to the North-South railway in the first speech delivered by the first Governor-General. We have been playing with this question long enough. We have already spent several millions on the Federal Capital, and have committed ourselves to the expenditure of many more millions upon that Capital. From a closer settlement and national production point of view, that expenditure will not benefit Australia very much. It seems to me that we can only find out whether the centre of Australia is excellent sheep country, as the experts say it is, by building a railway to it. We know already that it is excellent cattle country. Cattle have been driven from the Macdonnell Ranges, 325 miles, to Oodnadatta, trucked there, railed nearly 700 miles to Adelaide, and then railed' on to Melbourne, where they fetched the top prices in the market. That has happened on more than one occasion. Those who have had experience with horses know that the finest horseflesh Australia can produce comes from the Macdonnell Ranges. Yet, while enthusiasts have been "battling." in this Parliament for the expenditure of millions of pounds at Canberra, they will not face one of the greatest developmental propositions that has ever confronted a National Parliament. It is within the memory of many honorable members that exactly the same things as have been printed day after day by the metropolitan dailies of Australia concerning the proposal to build the North-South railway were printed by American newspapers in regard to the proposal to build a railway across the United States of America. They said that such a railway would never pay for axle grease, and so on. We all know the arguments that were advanced against the building of that line.. If we are to hold Australia as a white man's country we must make a serious attempt to settle people in the interior, and we can only do that by giving them transport facilities. What other country has developed without the building of railways? Java, a fertile island, which is a little less than twice the size of Tasmania, has thousands of miles of railways, yet our Northern Territory, with its 523,000 square miles, is said to have been given a chance of developing with only 199½ miles of railway; and that I am sorry to say is at the wrong end of it. If the problem of developing the Northern Territory had been tackled from the south, by now there would have been a very fine settlement in and around the Macdonnell Ranges. I am sorry that the Government in power when the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth made the unfortunate mistake of sending a huge staff of civil servants to Darwin, where they seem to be running over one another. </para>

It is remarkable that if people who have lived there for a length of time move south, they soon want to get back again. We who are the custodians of the public purse should be prepared to spend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in an endeavour to develop this vast area. Apart altogether from its pastoral prospects, there is the possibility of opening up important mining propositions. I do not suggest that the railway should be built purely for mining development, unless, of course, it were definitely proved that a wonderful field was awaiting exploitation; but if we add to the prospects of the pastoral industry the possibility of important mining developments, I am satisfied that an excellent case may be made out for the construction of this line. For 400 miles north of the Macdonnell Ranges - for a distance certainly of 350 miles - every known commercial mineral excepting tin has been discovered. The farthest south that tin has been discovered is at Marranboy, 250 miles south of Darwin. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> who was head of a prospecting party in 1901, stated in- a report to the South Australian Government that excellent "shows" had been found in Central Australia, but that in the absence of railway facilities anything under 10 ounces to the ton could not be made to pay. From the centre of the mineral fields to the nearest railway in Queensland the distance is 360 miles, over a long dry stretch of country. </para>

                        <para>- No, I am speaking of Hatch's Creek, as the centre of the mineral field to  which  I refer. When war broke out Britain was very short of wolfram, a commodity essential for the hardening of steel. This area sent away scores of theusands of pounds' worth of this valuable mineral, the deposits of which are reported to be wonderfully rich. In addition to wolfram, there is also molybdenite, and any quantity of copper and silver-lead, as well as wonderful de posits of mica, some of which, according to recent reports, realized 32s. per lb. in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know if there are better fields, but there is very little better mica anywhere in the world than that found north-east of the Macdonnell Ranges. Unfortunately transport difficulties prevent the development of the field. It has been said, in criticism of the field, that the seams are not large. This may be correct, but the difficulties of marketing the product are increased by the unsatisfactory transport arrangements. There is always the possibility of the camels throwing their loads and shattering the mica, so that when it reaches its destination it is in small pieces, probably only capable of being cut into pieces 4 or 5 inches square, and worth from 5s. to 6s. per  lb., whereas, if it could be marketed in squares of 12 inches or 15 inches, it would be worth from 30s. to 35s. per lb. Unless improved transport facilities are provided there is not much possibility of converting that wonderful mica asset into cash. At Arltunga, only 65 miles from Alice Springs, there is a hill of quartz known as the White Range. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> a former geologist of the South Australian Government, that hill would assay 7 dwt. to the ton, but, obviously, in view of the heavy expenditure that must be incurred in getting machinery through, it would be impossible to work a low grade proposition like that on a big scale. One company sent a boiler up to a place called Winnecke's Depot, not far from Alice Springs, at a cost of £1,500, and it took the teams fourteen months to do the job. In view of these facts it is easily understandable that mining people in the south are not very keen about investing in Central Australian mineral " shows," but I am optimistic enough to say that, up to the present, we have only scratched the surface of' Australia in regard to its mining possibilities. A railway line to Alice Springs would give a wonderful fillip to the mining industry in Central Australia. Who can say that before long we may not have another Mount Morgan, another Broken Hill, or, perhaps, another Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie? Silver-lead and copper have been discovered at Barrow's Creek. This mining proposition would be within easy reach of a railway, if one were made to the Macdonnell Ranges, and I have been assured by gentlemen interested in that proposition that if the line went to Alice Springs, and if it were proved that the lode at Barrow's Creek dips down, as they' honestly think it does, they would be prepared to construct a light line from Alice Springs to Barrow's Creek. This north-south railway, which has been promised to South Australia for so many years, will, be the connecting link with the north eventually. I do not assume that the House will authorize the construction of a line to Alice Springs, and then make a definite promise that it shall immediately go straight through to Daly Waters, the terminus of the projected line from the northern end. The Public Works Committee which,, in 1921, investigated the various routes, recommended that the line should be built from Mataranka to Daly Waters. The section from Emungalan to Mataranka was approved in 1916, but no construction work has yet been undertaken. The construction of a bridge over the Katherine River was also recommended in 1916, and has just been commenced. Following the construction of a railway to Daly Waters, the Committee approved of a low-level line being built from .Oodnadatta to Alice Springs of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge with steep momentum grades, secondhand rails, fastenings and sleepers at a cost, including the rolling-stock necessary for the working of the line, of £1,558,600. It also recommended that the line from Katherine River to Daly Waters should not be constructed unless the Government decided that it should be continued as far south as Newcastle Waters, or Powell's Creek, and thence across into the Barkly Tableland. I said, when the authorizing measure was before the House, that I doubted whether the extension for a distance of only 161 miles would add another settler to the country. I may have been in error, but I am satisfied that it will not make very much difference to the settlers until the line touches the Barkly Tableland. No one realizes that better than the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> and the Minister for' Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who went through the Northern Territory about twelve months ago. If the line were constructed from Newcastle Waters or Powell's Creek - I would prefer Powell's Creek - then towards the Queensland border net to 'Camooweal, but to a point south, in my opinion, it would bisect better country. With that line constructed, and also the line to Alice Springs, the distance between that place and Powell's Creek would be about 400 miles/ A future Parliament would then be able to decide, on the amount of settlement that had taken place, whether the connexion should be made by a direct line. I am satisfied that with the construction of the railway to Alice Springs scores of settlers would be prepared to take up land in the centre of Australia, and engage in sheep-raising. All they want is some encouragement in the form of facilities such as have been provided for graziers in every other part of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cavenagh,</inline> who has sheep at Arltunga, informed me that on one occasion, although he had to drive them 375 miles along the stock route to the nearest point on the railway line, he sent as many as 1,000 sheep over the route without losing a single head. This demonstrates that, generally, the s'ock-route conditions are very good. He also informed me that he got an average of 34d. per lb. for his wool - another indication that the country from the grazier's point of view is good. Unfortunately, at the present time, sheep there have to be shepherded. That, as honorable members must know, is a heavy item of expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- And in addition, as the honorable member for the Northern Territory has reminded me, besides the natural grasses there are several varieties  of edible bushes, which are a remarkable standby during a dry season. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> knows the Depot Sand Hills country, 26 miles through. The layman with but a superficial knowledge of that country would think it was not worth the toss of a coin, but I saw cattle come off the Depot Sand Hills in good condition, notwithstanding there is no water available other than that which might lie in the sand for a few hours after rain. The stock subsisted on a little plant called parakeia, not unlike what is known in the south as pig-face. It is a plant with a remarkable water-content. The edible bushes mentioned are buck bush, blue bush, salt bush, goat's head, mulga, &amp;c. The whole of the country from the Territory border may be taken up by graziers. The time has arrived for this House to take a courageous stand in regard to expenditure for developmental purposes. We have authorized the expenditure of vast sums of money for the Murray irrigation scheme. We have spent something like £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 on the East- West railway, but the House does not seem to be able to make up its mind to spend money for the genuine development of the Commonwealth's own territory. We have been invited by the Queensland Government to build the line down to Powell's Creek, thence across the Barkly Tableland, and down through western Queensland to' link up with the rail head at Bourke, New South Wales. I approve of the construction pf that line, but I do not think that the Commonwealth should undertake the expenditure and at the same time not build a railway line in its own territory to Alice Springs. The latter should be the first undertaking. In the United States of America no less than 150,000 miles of standard gauge railways have been built in the last 30 years, whereas in Australia a few thousand miles, at the most, have been constructed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is so, for in the last 20 years very little railway extension has been undertaken in Australia. The time is now ripe for us to tackle the problem seriously. I have travelled over a great part of the Northern Territory, and, having studied the subject of its development for at least two and a half years, I say, advisedly, that the House would do well to proceed with the construction of a line from Oodnadatta <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Alice Springs. The country would certainly justify a railway. I am not forgetting the fact that when the Commonwealth Government took over from South Australia the Quorn-Oodnadatta line it made a definite promise to that State to complete the North-South railway. Some honorable members contend that in law the agreement with South Australia would not be binding on the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but, apart from that question, I am submitting my motion on the strength of what I have green of the country that would be opened up for settlement. I have discussed the matter with men who know good land when they see it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman recently told me that if the line were built, it would bring about the development of the central portion of Australia by sheep raising. I am aware of the fact that if the Government constructs a light railway there it would be necessary to go a little further and give the settlers some assistance; but I claim that this would be quite justified, and would be preferable to heavy expenditure such as has been incurred in other parts of Australia to assist men to produce crops for which no market can be found. Australian wool is a commodity for which the world is clamouring. Our flocks to-day number between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000 less than they did thirty years ago, and the flocks of the Argentine have decreased during a similar period from 65,000,000 to 34,000,000. When the late Lord. Forrest was once advocating the construction of the wonderful water scheme in Western Australia, somebody remarked that it would cost £1,000,000. Lord Forrest replied, "What is a million?"' I borrow that phrase, and ask " What is a million and a half to Australia when we have such, a vast area of splendid land in the interior?" I am sorry that so* many people decry the central portion of this continent. It is said that white people cannot live there, and that millions of pounds have been wasted on attempts to develop the country. I repeat that the money has been spent at the wrong end-of the Territory. Had we pushed the railway line through from the south there would now be something to show for the money that has been thrown away in the north. </para>

                        <para>- I claim that much of it has been absolutely wasted. Look at the money that has been spent to no purpose at the Mataranka sheep station and the Daly River settlement, to which thousands of pounds worth of machinery, was sent before it was know whether the country could yield the products for which the machinery was intended. If half of that money had been devoted to developing the Territory from the southern end we should to-day have had a great deal more to see for our expenditure. -Surely it would be better to endeavour to settle the country from the southern end, where settlement already exists, than to send people half way round Australia, a distance of 6,000 miles from Melbourne, in the endeavour to develop the heart of this continent. The whole story of attempts at settlement in the north of the Territory has been a tragedy from first to last, from the time when the first effort at settlement was made at Raffles Bay in 1823, until the present time. Had railway construction proceeded from the southern end, Australia would have been millions of pounds in pocket, and there would have been a population in Central Australia to-day. I sincerely trust that honorable members will realize that they should not ask whether a railway into the centre of Australia would pay immediately. They should remember the experience of the private companies that built the transcontinental railways in the United States of America and Canada. Those were essentially lines of development. I am not sufficiently optimistic to think that the line I am advocating will prove a payable proposition at first, but I am at least certain that if it is built as far as Alice Springs, the loss to the Commonwealth on the whole line from Quorn to Alice Springs will be no greater than on the existing section. </para>

                    <para>. -  In seconding the motion I desire to express my appreciation of the manner in which the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> has championed a good cause. I entirely endorse his statement that without railways in the Territory the Commonwealth may as well put up the shutters there altogether. The present cost of transportation is so prohibitive, that it is impossible to carry. on the sheep industry on a profitable basis. The Commonwealth has lost £1,500,000 on the Quorn-Oodnadatta line since it took that section oyer from South Australia, and we shall continue to lose at that rate so long as the railway terminates at Oodnadatta; whereas, if it is continued to the centre of Australia, the present deficit will be converted into a profit. It has been argued that cattlemen would not send their stock by such a railway, but I have no doubt that station-owners generally would patronize it. I shall content myself on this occasion by supporting the motion, trusting that a quick decision will be reached. </para>

                    <para>.- I also wish to compliment the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> upon his attitude on this subject. He has probably given it more consideration than any other honorable member, and seeing that he comes from the State of Tasmania, he must be credited with dealing with the question purely from a national stand-point. On that account, his views are worthy of careful consideration, and he deserves the thanks of the House for his informative speeches on Northern Territory subjects. Over a long period, Governments have neglected their plain duty in regard to the Territory. For many years, the Commonwealth has failed to discharge its obligation to South Australia to construct the north-south railway by a direct route. A Bill at present before the House aims at the stabilization of the pastoral and other industries in the Territory. There may be endless debate, but the problem of the Territory cannot be solved by means of a Land Ordinance, or anything else, until we have provided the necessary transport facilities, and until settlers are enabled to live there under conditions suitable for white people. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Common wealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their investigation and report thereon :  - Erection of building in Brisbane for accommodation of Commonwealth Departments (in lieu of the offices, the erection of which was reported on by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, on 28th October, 1922), upon a site embracing portion of the site referred to in the report of the Committee dated 28th October, 1922, and land adjacent thereto. </para>

                    <para class="block">In December, 1910, a committee of officers was appointed to investigate and report upon the accommodation for Commonwealth requirements in Brisbane. It reported, in July, 1910, that offices were situated in rented premises all over the city, and recommended that they be concentrated in one building on a convenient site, and suggested that a building capable of expansion from time to time be erected on the Adelaide street site, which was already Commonwealth property. Although details of accommodation required for the various Departments were obtained, the proposal was held in abeyance owing to difficulties in connexion with the utilization of portion of the proposed site, which was required for defence purposes. Another proposal to erect the parcels post and postal stores building on the same land was considered, but this precipitated a civic movement in Brisbane to obtain the whole of the site for a city improvements scheme. The various bodies concerned in this project had a conference in 1915, and consideration was given to several designs prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch,</inline> Chief Commonwealth Architect, for the best use of the area in the public interest. The conference agreed, to recommend that a scheme be adopted which provided for an open square between Ann and Adelaide streets, flanked at each end by groups of buildings, one of which would be of a commercial character, while the other would provide for Commonwealth requirements'. Negotiations regarding this proposal were continued between the State and Federal Governments, but no definite action was taken in the matter, the war and the consequent difficulty over finance probably being the main cause of holding up the question. In 1919 a proposal was put forward from Brisbane to utilize the whole area bounded by the four streets as a war memorial square, but the Commonwealth Government could not see its way to agree to this, owing to the difficulty in obtaining equally suitable sites for its own purposes. It agreed, however, to give further consideration to the scheme providing for a central square, flanked by Government buildings at each end, as such a square, whilst a benefit to the City of Brisbane, would, at the same time, prove of great financial value to the Commonwealth. The matter was then stated to be urgent, as the State Government announced its intention of building on its portion of the land at an early date. The Commonwealth Government then referred the matter to the Public Works Committee for investigation. After considering the various schemes that had been put forward, the Committee, in July, 1921, reported in favour of the proposal for the creation of a memorial square, 200 feet in width, supported on either flank by Commonwealth and State public offices respectively, and involving the Commonwealth in the cession of a strip of land 40 feet wide for the purposes of the square, at the same time providing valuable frontage and light for Commonwealth requirements. The Queensland Government also agreed to this scheme, which was endorsed by the Federal Parliament on the 6th December, 1921. Preparations were then 'made by the Commonwealth, 'in touch with the State Government, to draw lip plans for the building to be erected on the Commonwealth side of the square. These were passed by the Public Works Committee, and endorsed by the Commonwealth Parliament on the 25th August, 1923. Preparations to call tenders were practically complete, when, 'at the request of a deputation which waited 0,n the Acting Prime Minister, directions were given for action to be stayed, pending further consideration of views pub forward by local authorities that the whole of the land concerned should be devoted to the memorial square. The question was the subject of further negotiations with the State Government, the Memorial Square Committee, the Brisbane Council, and others, and the Commonwealth took the view that it could not accede to the proposal to give up the whole of the land. After further consultation, however, an amended scheme was evolved, providing for a larger square, which would involve a rearrangement of the building proposals, by which the Commonwealth would receive special advantages in regard to building frontages and future accommodation for its activities, and at the same time the views of the local authorities would be met respecting the creation of a more suitable memorial square than that originally proposed. That is the reason why the Commonwealth Government, after having received the previous report, now asks that the matter be again referred to the Committee. I lay on the table, as required by the Act, plans, &amp;c, of the proposed work. </para>

                        <para>.- The House should be informed, whether, at the time the Committee was dealing with this matter previously, any representations were made to it regarding the necessity of setting aside this area for the purpose of a war memorial square. If representations of that nature were then made, some explanation of the decision of the Committee against the area being  30  utilized, and in favour of buildings being erected on the site, appears to be necessary. I am not referring to the expense which may be incurred, because for a matter of this kind the amount is not great. I take it that the Government are now paying rent to different people in Brisbane for accommodation for Commonwealth offices, and for that reason it is probable that these buildings are urgently required. </para>

If these buildings are required, further delay is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- As pointed out by the Minister, in 1910 a committee of officers was appointed, and asked to investigate and report upon the housing accommodation for officials in Brisbane, and whether buildings to accommodate them should be erected. The committee recommended the erection of a building in a- central position capable of expansion.. The Leader of the Opposition asks whether the desire of the people of Queensland to have a memorial square in Brisbane was placed before the Committee in 1921. Evidence to that effect was placed before the Committee, but at the time the proposition was for a very small square. Since then the Government of Queensland has offered a larger area, and proposals to make a better memorial square have been brought forward. The proposal before us, if carried, will be to the advantage of the Commonwealth Government. We are not asked to supply a square, but have to consider whether the proposal will be of advantage to the country as a whole. This case is analogous to that of the acquisition of land for the building of a post office at Perth. In that instance more land was acquired than was necessary at the time for the building of the post office, but it has since proved to have been a sound investment. I hope there will be no opposition to the motion. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee  011  Public Works for investigation and report, viz. :  - The erection of a building at Canberra for Departmental Secretariats, including provision for an Automatic Telephone Exchange and Post Office. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>When the Seat of Government is transferred to Canberra, according to the scheme of construction now in progress, it will be necessary to provide accommodation for sections or secretariats of the various Departments, whose representation will then be essential. Honorable members probably know that the permanent administration offices will not be ready for occupation  at  the time when it is proposed to transfer Parliament to Canberra. At the initial stage, skeleton staffs of the various Departments will' need to be transferred to carry on the work of Parliament. It is proposed to house these skeleton staffs principally in this building, pending the completion of the permanent administration office building recommended by the Public Works Committee, and for the design of which Parliament has directed the holding of an architectural competition. Plans of a proposed provisional secretariat building, to house these sections of Departments, have been prepared and are now submitted for the consideration of the Public Works Committee, in accordance with Statute. They provide the accommodation stated by the several Departments to be necessary for their operations at the time Parliament will sit. A district post-office and an automatic telephone exchange, in the official area of Canberra, will also be necessities when legislation commences, and to avoid the erection of comparatively small separate structures within this area, it is proposed to include this postal and telephone accommodation in the same building as the secretariats, in the manner indicated in the plans. The building has been designed to afford, when vacated by the Departments, official rooms of convenient size for members of Parliament, anticipating the probability of such provision being found to be a necessity at Canberra. By such a system, of convenient, inexpensive subdivision of the floors, as planned,  54  rooms of a general unit size of  21  feet by  14  feet will be obtained, and the plan is arranged for one bath-room to every four rooms to be added when required. The plan also provides for caretaker's quarters to bc arranged. A further building of similar size and design, but without post-office and telephone exchange, might possibly be erected at a site at the western side of the official area, to balance and correspond with the building now proposed. Such a building would afford  72  unit rooms, with bath-rooms, and caretaker's quarters, on the scale ' provided for in the provisional secretariat building. Provided, therefore, that the policy becomes such that each senator and representative shall be provided with a room, a maximum of.  126  rooms will be obtainable in two buildings of the design proposed. Exclusive of the essential corridors, staircases, lavatories, recreation accommodation - the latter to eventually become caretaker's quarters - heating chamber, and promenade roofs, the project now submitted would provide the following effective accommodation: - Offices, for secretariate,  19,712  feet; post-office,  2,518  feet ; automatic  telephone exchange,  5,530  feet; totalling  27,760  feet. The probable cost of the building, not including equipment connected with the telephone installation, laying out of grounds; and engineering services outside the building, would be  £39,000.  As required by the Public Works Committee Act, I lay' on the table the plans, &amp;c, relating to this proposed work. </para>

                        <para>.- During last week I had the pleasure  o'f  visiting Canberra, and of seeing the expedition with which Parliament House is being erected. About one-third of the brickwork is already laid, and the roof is on the hostel. I gained the impression, during my stay there, that, in Parliament House itself, accommodation would be provided for members to the extent - I am speaking from memory - of one small room for each member. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite satisfied with that reply, because I think accommodation for private members of this Parliament is long overdue. I hope that the Minister, in any proposal that he makes to the Public Works Committee, respecting accommodation for the rank and file of Parliament, will see that, at all events, it is quite adequate, and that we shall have the necessary privacy and plenty of room to interview constituents and visitors, instead of being relegated to corners as is now the practice here. </para>

                        <para>. - It is something like ten months ago since I moved the second reading of this measure, and I am not surprised that, in the interim, some honorable members have forgotten its purport. There seems to be a general misconception on the part of honorable members, some thinking that the Bill, if passed, will consolidate all the present laws affecting lands in the Northern Territory, and bring new conditions into immediate operation. This measure certainly consolidates all the laws relating to the Territory, but it will not affect any of the present lessees, or, at any rate, those under the South Australian Act, unless they elect to surrender their leases and become subject to the Bill. To that extent only will there be a consolidation of the laws concerning the Northern Territory. This is a very necessary step making for improved administration, and disposing of many anomalies that at present exist. Any lessee who does not choose to come under the provisions of the Bill will continue his tenure until the expiration of his lease, when the land will revert to the Commonwealth, to be dealt with as the then Minister and the Lands Department think fit. I shall refer, briefly, to one or two statements that were made by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson).</inline> He seemed to have a confused idea of the real meaning of a number of provisions in the Bill. I, in common with honorable members who have carefully studied the Bill, have failed to read into it the meaning that the honorable member has given to its provisions. In the first place, he practically accused this Government of conspiring with the pastoral lessees of the Northern Territory to introduce this measure. </para>

                            <para>- There is no foundation whatever for that charge, as will be seen from a review of the history of the measure. The honorable member for the Northern Territory has been misled by certain documents which dealt with only the tag end of the arrangement that was entered into between the Minister of the day and the pastoralists. The need for the Bill arose in this way : When the Hughes Government was in office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was then and is now the Minister for Home and Territories, felt that if the Government were to carry out a developmental policy in the Northern Territory, as they intended to do, and as this Government intend to do, it was necessary for them to obtain a greater control. of the leased lands. On the 2nd November, 1922, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Pearce,</inline> when at Unley, a suburb of Adelaide, made a speech in which he outlined the policy now incorporated in the Bill. The Minister's speech was published widely, and at that time created a stir in pastoral quarters. A deputation of representatives of pastoralists from the Northern Territory interviewed the Minister and put their case before him. They obtained a promise that when the draft Ordinance was prepared they would have the opportunity of seeing it, and offering such comment as they thought fit. That promise was kept, and the pastoralists made a number of suggestions. Although they did not secure the amendments that they desired - and they were very important amendments, too - they were quite satisfied nevertheless to come under the provisions of the Bill. If it is passed, I expect that a large number of the pastoralists will, as soon as possible, surrender their leases or take advantage of the subdivisional  clauses, thus bringing about the very object of the Ordinance - closer pastoral settlement so that sheep as well as cattle may be raised in the Northern Territory. While all this was going on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massy</inline> Greene, whose name has been brought into the matter, was a member of the Hughes Government, but he had nothing whatever to do with the drafting of this measure. It was only after the last election that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greene</inline> appeared on the scene in association with the pastoralists of the Northern Territory. So far as the present Government is concerned, the terms of the Ordinance were practically settled before it took office, and only a few slight amendments were necessary to put it in the form in which it is now before the House. It is, therefore, quite a mistaken idea to suppose that any pressure was brought to bear upon the Government, or that it connived in any way at proposals intended to enable the big land-holders of the Northern Territory to secure advantages at the expense of other people. I am sorry that the honorable member for the Northern Territory should have thought fit to suggest anything of the kind. He should have been better informed, and evidently sought the wrong source of information. The honorable member has said that all the cattle necessary to comply with the stocking conditions for a large run might be placed on one corner of it. If that is so it is due to a defect of the present law which we are trying to alter in this Bill. The most stringent stocking conditions are possible under this measure. The Land Board will have the power to frame them, and there can be no doubt that the pastoralists themselves expect under this Bill to be faced with more stringent stocking conditions. It is the experience of the Department that the improvements required under the existing law are actually a bar to settlement in the Northern Territory. If proper stocking conditions under this Bill are to be complied with, the pastoralist must necessarily improve his run. But he will, under this measure, be the judge of what improvements are necessary, and will not be bound by hard and fast improvements regulations, as under the existing law, requiring him to make a number of improvements which might be quite unnecessary for his purpose. As a matter of fact, the improvement conditions under the existing law are so stringent that they cannot be carried out in their entirety. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have just said that if they were rigidly enforced the effect would be to drive many people off their runs and to prevent small men, for whom the honorable member is rightly solicitous, from taking up land in the Territory. Some people talk as if the Northern Territory were a kind of Eldorado, to which people ardently desired t.o go. As a matter of fact, there are only 181,000 square miles of the Territory leased at the present time. Two thirds of its area is still available for occupation, but so far from there being any rush of people to get land there, 11,000 square miles of previously-leased country have quite recently been surrendered to the Crown. </para>

If the honorable member would read the speeches delivered by the Minister for Home and Territories in another place or my speech in moving the second reading of the Bill, he would find that all these matters were referred to as difficulties which must be overcome if we are to secure the raising of sheep in the Northern Territory. No developmental policy is laid down in this Bill. This is a Laud Bill to provide land laws and a land system for the Territory. The developmental policy will follow in Bills for the construction of railways, roads, and other means of communication and transport. The Government must first get control of the lands in the Territory to make any developmental policy feasible. </para>

The thing, is of course, ridiculous. We are dealing now with a land Ordinance, and I say that it is a very good Ordinance. The more closely it is studied the harder it will be for honorable members opposite to condemn it. That is shown by the fact that during the debate on the second reading no honorable member on the other side has made a concrete suggestion to better the provisions set out in the Bill. I challenged them ten months ago to consider the Bill fairly, take all the facts into account, the position and conditions under which an arrangement had to be come to, and then to produce a better scheme. </para>

                            <para>- While the honorable member for the Northern Territory was making all these charges about collusion between pastoralists and the Government, he stated that the pastoralists' committee had actually decided that no improvement conditions should be included in the new Bill. That statement is absolutely incorrect and has no foundation in fact. This will be clear to the honorable member if he will read the speech  delivered at Unley by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on the 2nd November, 1922. That speech was. the beginning of the proceedings which culminated in the drafting of the measure now before the House. The honorable member for the Northern Territory told the House that when the time came for existing lessees to surrender portions of their runs they would be able, under this measure, to defy the Government. In support of his contention he referred to a man in the Northern Territory who had a store and desired a square mile of country for certain purposes, and said that when the lessee of the run was asked to surrender the area required he refused to give up an inch of his land. I ask the honorable member whether he was referring to the case of a man named Rankin. </para>

                            <para>- I am informed that a man named Rankin made such an application, and the lessee to whom the Government referred it signed the necessary papers surrendering 2 square miles of his run. I point out to the honorable member that if the pastoral lessees come under this Bill they will have to comply with its provisions. When the time comes, the Government of the day can take the necessary steps to put the provisions of the Bill into operation, and it will be nonsense for people to talk of refusing to surrender portions of their holding if the law says otherwise. I wish now to refer to an important objection which the honorable member raised, but which I do not think he can sustain, in connexion with clause 58, which permits lessees to subdivide their runs, and lease portions of them to incoming lessees. This is the provision under which honorable members opposite claim that it will be possible to foster dummying. I admit that dummying is very difficult to deal with. Some people are so very ingenious that if they are bent on dummying they seem to be able to evade what appear to be very tightly drawn laws. But I do not think there will be very' much danger of dummying under this measure. The honorable member seems to think that it will permit lessees to nominate others for subdivisions of their runs, and later to take them over again. He suggested that this kind of thing might go on for years. </para>

                            <para>- I am not, because the land must be put to a proper use. The subdivisional lease will be subject to the provisions of the 'Bill. It will' contain the powers of resumption, liability of compliance with stocking conditions, and with all the covenants set out in the Bill, and the tenure of none can extend beyond the 30th June, 1965. In order to remove all possibility of dummying, I propose, at the Committee stage, to submit an amendment to sub-clause 2 of clause 58. The provision as it stands is permissive; it says that the lessee may do certain things, and I propose, by an amendment, to make it compulsory upon him to do them.. We are endeavouring to tighten the law as much as possible, and I do not think there will be any more effective law in Australia for the prevention of dummying. I intend to propose a similar amendment to clause 31, which deals with mortgagees. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are bringing forward these amendments quite spontaneously, and not as the result of criticism. . This Ordinance is mainly a re-enactment of the present law with a few alterations relating, amongst other things, to the re-appraisement of rents, which will enable us to get higher rentals than are collected under the South Australian laws, </para>

Clauses 50 to 63. comprise the new features of the land policy, and under those clauses the period of certain leases, will be extended, but. none may extend beyond the 30th June, 1965. At the present time the greater portion of the land that is most favorably situated in relation to stock routes and water supplies is held under the old South Australian laws, and two-thirds of those leases have a further currency of from seventeen to twenty on a years. In respect of them we have no* power of resumption, and the lessees may , continue to hold them as they do at. present. We hope they will elect to sur- render or, alternatively, subdivide their holdings so that new settlers may come in. If that is done each original lease will support four or five lessees instead of one. </para>

                            <para>- The lease of the subdivision will be granted by the Government, and will be subject to all the conditions of this Bill. Apart from the need for a general developmental policy, which has no place in a land Ordinance, the principal subject of discussion has been the length of time for which the land will be tied up under the conditions of this Bill. But I would like to impress upon the House that under it the Government will get control of the land sooner than, it would if the existing tenures were undisturbed. If the lessees choose to surrender, the Commonwealth will by 1935 regain control of an area of about ' 24^000 square miles, whereas if we wait until the existing leases lapse only about 3,800 square miles will revert to the Crown by that year. It is necessary for us to get the land under proper control before we can launch a large developmental policy, and by the provisions of this Bill we shall make a fair area of land available for settlement more rapidly than if we wait for existing leases to expire. The lessees may surrender immediately if they so choose, and we have an assurance  from representative pastoralists that they will take advantage of the provisions of this Bill in regard to surrender and' subdivision. The fears of some honorable members that the subdivision clauses will facilitate dummying are groundless. The Government hopes that the provisions for subdivision will expedite the settlement of people who are prepared to engage in sheep-raising. The Minister for Home and Territories was confronted with the fact that all the big South Australian leases, and the 42-year leases under the Commonwealth Ordinance, look up the land for a long time. Honorable members opposite seem to expect the pastoralists to surrender their leases and get nothing in return. </para>

Let us first get control of the land, in order to prepare the way for a general developmental scheme. Railways, roads, and other facilities may follow. Without some means of getting control of the land, honorable members would not be prepared to vote for a big developmental scheme for the Territory. The  Minister  for Home and Territories is anxious to develop the Territory, but he is not prepared to embark on a big works policy until he  gets  more control over the land and greater power to compel its utilization. </para>

                            <para>- Yes , and this Ordinance will provide adequate means of dealing with the land that is at present unutilized if we can get people to apply for it. We are endeavouring, by means of this land policy, to prepare the Territory for development by roads, railways, and other facilities. I have no objection to the appointment of a Committee to report on the best means of developing the Territory, but I do not think that such an inquiry would help in the formulation of. a land system. The Northern Territory, like other portions of Australia, must have a pastoral era before it can be ready for subdivision and closer settlement. </para>

Having received certain assurances from the pastoralists, I expect a large number of leases to be surrendered under this Bill. Later, when we are in possession of complete information as to the best means of developing the Territory, this Government will submit a policy of works to the House. The Bill is mainly one for consideration in Committee, and without occupying more time in the discussion of general principles, I urge the House to agree to the second reading. </para>

                    <para class="block">As the clause is framed at present, the three members of the Board are to be appointed by the Minister. One of these is to be selected by the Minister from three persons nominated by the pastoralists; but the clause does not provide the manner in which they are to be elected or nominated. I am concerned with the smaller pastoralists, holding from 700 to 1,000 square miles. I have received a telegram from the secretary of the Pastoralists Association, asking me to endeavour to make it perfectly clear that that association wishes to have some voice in the appointment of its representative. Honorable members will agree that it is only fair that the people in the Northern Territory should have a definite voice in the appointment of their representative. There is nothing clear in the clause as to the procedure to be followed, but if my amendment were adopted the pastoralists themselves could by popular vote elect their own representative. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised that the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> has not risen to respond to the request of the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson).</inline> The proposition submitted by the honorable member is a reasonable one. What objection is there to the pastoralists selecting their own representative on the proposed Land Board? Why should a panel of three be submitted to the Minister from which he may select one who might possibly be the one least desired by the pastoralists. If we are to look after the  interests of land settlement in the Northern Territory - and that has been the argument put forward by honorable members opposite - surely those immediately concerned should be allowed to nominate their own representative. When the Minister can appoint two members it is unfair to give him the right also to select one of three suggested by the pastoralists. One of these men may be more concerned with the welfare of the big pastoralist than with that of the smaller man. A vote should be taken, as is done when appointments are made to any other Board . </para>

                            <para>- One who works in his. own interests rather than in the interests of the community generally. Unfortunately a few such persons exist. I do not wish to mention names, but in the Northern Territory there are men who hold very large areas. If such a one were nominated with two others the Government might regard the size of his holding as a justification for appointing him to the Board. It is not always the man with the largest interests who is most likely to assist development. Invariably the man who has a less interest is more concerned with the development of that interest; because the wealthy man can afford to sit back until railways are constructed, and then derive the benefit of the unearned increment. If we are anxious to develop the Territory we must have on the Board some one who has been chosen by the people whose interests are directly affected. At Parliamentary elections the people indicate their choice of a representative. Why should not that principle be applied in this case, in order to conserve the interests of those who take up pastoral leases? Why should the lessees submit the names of three persons and allow the Government to decide who shall be appointed to the Board ? </para>

                            <para>- The Government will have a say, to the extent that it will have as its representatives on the Board two of the three members. How, then, could the Government's interests bo jeopardized? Those two members may not have an intimate knowledge of land matters or of the conditions obtaining in the Territory. If ever it was necessary to appoint a practical man, possessing a knowledge of the Territory and of the conditions, that necessity exists in this case. In order to develop the Territory there must bc appointed to this Board one who will be able to give sound advice. I submit that no genuine objection can be taken to this amendment. It would not destroy the Bill. On the contrary, it would improve it. Surely, whatever differences there may be regarding the principle underlying the Bill, we ought to bc able to improve it in the interest of the Territory. N© party significance attaches to the amendment; the honorable member who has moved it is not connected with any party. What is the object of our considering the Bill in Committee if we are bound to accept the clauses as drafted by the Government? Although we recognize the justice of the amendment, are we to be compelled to reject it merely because the Minister is not prepared to accept it? This is not a vital amendment, so far as the position of the Government is concerned, although some members may think that the contrary is the case. Every one being desirous of developing the Territory as soon as possible, what objection can be raised to having on the Board a man who will be in touch with the majority of the lessees and qualified to advise the other members of the Board? Which is better, to have on the Board a man who possesses the confidence of a majority of the settlers, or one who is representative of only  one-thind  of the settlers? The latter could possibly afford to put up with unsatisfactory conditions because of his wealth, and the fact that if the conditions were bettered a greater degree of settlement would take place, and he would suffer in consequence. What satisfaction would it be to the lessees to have on the Board a man in whom they had no confidence? </para>

                            <para>- I differ from the honorable gentleman. The lessees, as the clause stands, have to nominate three persons, and from these the Minister selects one. The representative of the lessees should be chosen collectively by the people interested. That can be done only by submitting to a vote the names of thesese nominated. If, after such an election, the successful man were appointed by the Government, the lessees would have confidence in the Board, and would work under its decisions. If the appointment were made of a man who was unacceptable to the majority of the lessees, the Board would be damned from its inception, and nothing but complaint would be heard. Honorable members of the Country party have often claimed these right of the primary producers to be represented on certain Boards. </para>

The honorable member admits that that was done.  </para>

                            <para>- I mean pastoral . lessees. I am not asking that this amendment be accepted because it may bring us any gain politically; no such gain would follow. Surely the lessees have the right to nominate their own representative. The Minister can-  not lightly brush this matter aside, or vote the amendment out, without replying to the arguments advanced in favour of it. Debate must take place on an amendment such as this in order that honorable members may judge whether the measure would be improved by its acceptance. I submit that this amendment is an improvement on the clause as drafted, and should commend itself to any one who desires to do justice to the lessees in the Territory. We want to see the Territory populate'd, and not to expend public money unprofitably. A representative who is in direct touch with the lessees of the Territory, and who is approved by them, will be able to give great assistance to the other members of the Board. A practical man is needed on Boards of this kind. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot see that the clause will inflict any great hardship on the Northern Territory pastoralists, nor can I see that the amendment by the honorable member representing the Northern Territory would improve it. Under the Government proposal the pastoralists are entitled to nominate three of their number from whom the Minister will select one. The passing of this Bill will mark the beginning of a new era in the Northern Territory, and it is desirable that in the early stages of its administration the responsible Minister shall have a large measure of control. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot accept an amendment under duress. If the honorable member chooses to adopt the attitude that he will hold up the business of the country because of personal pique, that is his affair. The Government will not be stampeded. I consider that no advantage will be gained by accepting the amendment. It will not improve the Bill. The interests of the smaller pastoralists have not been overlooked. If the Leader of the Opposition will look at clause 11, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> he will find a provision that precludes any likelihood of a pastoralist in a big way of business accepting a position on the Land Board. The clause provides that a member of the Board shall be deemed to have vacated his office if - (d)he.  in any way, directly or indirectly is interested in any land, other than as a place of residence for himself or his family, in the Northern Territory, or in any matter which may arise in connexion therewith under this Ordinance, or engages in any live-stock transactions for the sake of gain or any other business. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret exceedingly that the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to threaten honorable members on this side of the Committee. His interjection a few minutes ago amounts to a threat. I have a good deal of sympathy for the proposal contained in the amendment. All honorable members have emphasized at some time in their public life that we are a Democratic community, and I fail to see that any reasonable objection can be taken to the amendment before the Committee. It is preferable, in my opinion, to the provision in the Bill. Since looking at the paragraph quoted by the Minister I am beginning to wonder whether any practical men will be able to accept a seat on the Board. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 11 appears to preclude every one other than a swagman from accepting a seat. </para>

                        <para>. - I am astonished that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> has adopted such a hostile attitude towards this amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> who fathered this Bill in another place is not in attendance to advise his colleague. Evidently he has given instructions that the Bill must be bludgeoned through this Committee in its present form. We might reasonably have expected the Minister who piloted this measure through the other Chamber to be here to listen to the opinions of honorable members of this Committee. It would have been courteous to do so. This is a most important Bill. I am surprised at the proposition contained in the clause now before us. It  may very well happen that, though the names of three pastoralists are submitted to the Minister, one of the nominees may possess the confidence of his fellows to a much greater degree than either of the others. I doubt very much whether it will be possible to submit the names of three suitable men . in view of the provisions of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 11. Even the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> finds' fault with that paragraph, and questions whether a practical man will be found to accept' a seat on the Board. Why, therefore, should we put the settlers to. the trouble of discovering' three such men? Many of the smaller' lessees in the' Territory have resided on their holdings for many years, and are more or' less out of touch with affairs in other parts of the Commonwealth. It will not be easy for them to find three men who will be willing to accept the heavy administrative responsibility . which will be placed upon the members of this Board. Honorable members -on this side of the Committee are only acting according to their customary policy in supporting this amendment. We always contend that the people most concerned by the administration of a Board such as this should have direct representation upon it. Let us suppose for a moment that three names are submitted to the Minister. Probably he will have no personal knowledge of any of them. Therefore, he will have either to leap in the dark or else obtain information from some outside source. From whom could he obtain information that would be of value to him? </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the opinion of the honorable member for Corio carries no weight with the Government. The Minister says that the reason why three names are to be submitted, and the selection of one is to be left to the Minister administering the Act, is that it is desirable that he should retain a large measure of control. I fail to see how that end will be attained by nominating three men. The appointment of this Board is a matter of considerable importance. The Minister has given us no indication whatever of the remuneration these men will receive. How much will the Board cost per annum ? The honorable member for Corio has pointed out that under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 11 only a swagman will be qualified to accept a seat on the Board. It is quite probable that the advice of an honest swagman would be more valuable to the Board than would that of many of the men who hold large interests in the Territory. A swagman would be more desirable than the Kidmans and the Jowetts who, no doubt, will be' pulling strings to give effect to their own will in the administration of the Northern Territory land laws. </para>

                            <para>- There are small land-holders on Lands Boards in New South Wales. They are appointed to these Boards because they are practical men. There is nothing to be feared from the presence of a small land-holder on such a Board. It is the big land monopolist who would withhold land from settlement that we have to guard against. As a matter of fact, this Ordinance should make impossible the recurrence in the Territory of any of those evils that have manifested themselves in the States. The aggregation of large estates in the Territory is an evil we can prevent. by having on an administrative Board, such as this Land Board will be, small practical men, who will be sympathetic " towards other small men whose, claims come before the Board for consideration. We should also provide for balloting for lands. Grave dissatisfaction exists with the system of allocating the western lands of New South Wales by other means than the ballot, and there is grave suspicion as to the bona fides of many men who have been allotted land under the method adopted. The balloting system is the fairest, and if it be applied in the Northern Territory there will not be the same risk as is likely to occur if the Land Board is given power to allot land to applicants. Although a big land-holder in the Territory may not secure a position on the Land Board, a person may be chosen who has big land interests <inline font-style="italic">iti</inline> Queensland or New South Wales, and whose interests bring him mostly into touch with the sons of wealthy men seeking holdings in the Territory. In such a case the small man would have very little chance of getting sympathetic treatment. Why cannot the Government trust the lessees to make their own choice? The only conclusion one can draw from the stand they are taking <inline font-style="italic">ap</inline> is that they are afraid, that the man elected by the lessees may belong ti» a political party opposed, to them. The method of having three men selected by the lessees, and the Minister, who probably knows none os? the three, making a choice from among them, is absolutely opposed to all democratic principles, and in practice will be found to be entirely against the best interests of the Territory. It is certainly opposed to the opinions of the men already there. But, of course, it is only what we expect from the present Government, because, whenever it has been a case of trusting the people or of "putting something over them," they have never been prepared to trust the people, and on every occasion have put something over them. They have never accepted responsibility, but have passed it on to Boards, the salaries of the members of which are a heavy burden on the taxpayers. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, we expect the Government to do something at some time. So far, this Government has been mainly noted for the fact that it has kept the doors of Parliament closed. It has been doing nothing, and doing it very well. Ministers are certainly entitled to certificates of merit for the consistency with which they have done nothing since they were elected. It is not the desire of honorable members of the Opposition to delay the passage of the Bill more than is necessary, but we must let the Government know that they must preserve the rights of the men in the Territory. These people are allowed to have a representative in this House, but the Government are not prepared to give him a vote. They tax the people of the Territory, but will not allow those taxpayers to have a vote here - a case of taxation without representation, if ever there was one. No one can say that the honorable member for the Northern Territory has identified himself with any party, or with the utterances of any party here, in this House. He has merely asked for a fair deal for the people he represents. When the Bill to enable the Northern Territory to have representation in this House was being debated, one of the reasons advanced in favour of it was that the representative of the people there would be able to advise the Government and the House generally on matters concerning the Territory of which the Government and the House might be" ignorant. There are other matters about which Ministers know nothing, but they certainly know very little about the Northern Territory; and yet the whips are cracked when the honorable member for the Northern Territory gives his opinion as to what should be done, and the Government express their intention of forcing a Bill through contrary to his advice. TheY have taken up this attitude because of certain conversations at Scott's Hotel with representatives of big pastoral companies who do not want any one else in their vicinity. The same evil was experienced in Queensland until there came into power a Labour Government sufficiently strong to break it down. The Commonwealth Government have; acceded to the dictates of a few interested individuals, and framed this Bill in accordance with the desires of those people. They have inserted a clause which absolutely prevents the voice of the people of the Territory from being heard, and they declare that the Bill will be passed whether it meets with the wishes of the honorable member for the Northern Territory or not. That honorable member might just as well not have been elected if his advice is not to be taken in connexion with the only Bill which may bring about some good for the Northern Territory. He is the only person in this Parliament who thoroughly understands the Territory. Having been forced to earn his living there for a great number of years, his opinion should carry the utmost weight in this House. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, after a keen contest, in which the big pastoralists spilled oceans  of  money in order to prevent him ' from coming to this House. Yet the Government flout his suggestions on this Bill. If they carry on in this way, the effect of their legislation will  be that nothing will be done for the Territory; and it will remain as it is to-day until a Labour Government repeals the obnoxious provisions of this Ordinance. When that is done, no doubt, we shall hear the cry of repudiation, as it was recently heard when a strong Government in Queensland took steps to right a wrong committed by a corrupt Administration of the past which sold the birthright of the children of the State for many years ahead. </para>

                            <para>- I speak without any feeling in the matter. I realize that gentlemen of the type of the honorable member are disciples of private enterprise with themselves as that private enterprise. They believe in using their ability to increase their own bank balances, which is quite in keeping with their policy of self first, self second, and, if there is anything left, self third. The people can come in afterwards. We claim that it is right for the Government of the country to protect the interests of the people. In all ages Tory Governments have been ready to sign away the rights of subsequent generations. In this Bill the thin end of the wedge has been inserted in the form of a provision which will prevent the people who are most interested from having representation on the Land Board. </para>

                            <para>- No. I sympathize with the Minister- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> because the steam-roller has been put over him. He has been told that he cannot accept any amendment. It is another exhibition of the " strong man act " on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> who piloted this Bill through the Senate, but is not in attendance to be consulted by his colleagues when this very important measure is under consideration in a Chamber that is more truly representative of the people of Australia than is the other. If he were here to-night he might be able to allay our fears, but as he is. not here the only thing the MinMinister in charge of the Bill can do is. to stolidly declare that he cannot accept any amendments. The manner in which the Government conduct their business is open to censure. Only a few days after the Bankruptcy Bill had passed its first and second readings, and had gone through Committee in another place, the Minister in charge of it came down with no fewer than 49 amendments, most of which had been suggested at the instigation of an outside body. And yet Ministers and their supporters talk about  domination of the Labour arty by outside bodies ! As the result of the Minister's action even supporters of the Government in another place demanded that the debate be adjourned till they had had an opportunity of considering the effects of the amendments. To a great majority of honorable members on this side of the House administration in the Northern Territory means nothing personally, but we take the view that as the honorable member for the Northern Territory is in close contact with the people most affected by this measure, his views should receive careful consideration. TheMin-ister ister has" merely told us that he cannot accept- the suggested amendment. He gave no adequate reason for his decision, notwithstanding that the honorable member for the Northern Territory emphasized that he had received a communication from the secretary of the "association most concerned stating that they wanted the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister is. determined not to see any. improvement, of course it will be impossible for me to demonstrate in what way the suggested amendment would be an improvement on the existing provision in the Bill. I Hope, however, that reasonable and helpful criticism from this side will receive due consideration. I can assure the Government that it will facilitate business in this House. As a land-holder all my life I can give th.e Minister an assurance that the suggestion is a reasonable' one. The pastoralists of the Northern Territory are not here to speak for themselves. Therefore, the Minister should accept the amendment and provide for the representation of the small land-holders on the Board. </para>

                            <para>- For the very adequate reason that the history of land settlement in Australia shows that when large land-holders have been appointed to membership of Land- Boards, they have, generally speaking, taken a prejudiced and jaundiced view of the rights of small settlers. As a result, the curse of land monopoly has been perpetuated throughout Australia" and the small men' have been unable to obtain justice . from the Land Boards. There was a great deal of corruption in regard to land administration in New South Wales before Labour made its influence felt. Large tracts of. valuable country were given by Tory Governments . and' Tory Land Boards to their friends for practically nothing. </para>

There are only about 3,000 souls there now, and I doubt if there are 200 lease-holders. I doubt also if the honorable member for the Northern Territory represents twenty lease-holders. I suppose there are not more than 1,000 electors in the whole of the Northern Territory. I am getting fed up with all this talk on the part of the honorable member about "Darwin, Darwin, Darwin." I want the Government to stand up to their responsibilities in the interests of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and to have a voice in the determination of who shall be their representatives on the proposed Board. I do not want to see any "sundowners " on it, because, in my opinion, a man with any brains would hot be a " sundowner." I want on the Board men of broad vision, men who have endured the hardships of the Northern Territory, men who have tackled the difficulties of pioneering in the home of the dingo, and have made their holdings reproductive. That class of man is not usually found among the party opposite. Its sentiment does not lend itself to the building of "men of the bull-dog breed," who have made Australia's name. I hope that the Minister will reject the amendment. </para>

I have listened to many feeble replies from Ministers, but the answer given to the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is about the weakest I have ever heard. The amendment in no way detracts from the value of the clause; it simply alters the method of electing a representative of the pastoralists. The only reason given by the Minister for objecting to the amendment is that he wants to reserve some control. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman also said that he wanted the Minister to be able to exercise some control. In what way, I ask, can the Minister do that? He may as well put the three names in a bag and pick one of them out, unless he is to be guided by information from interested sources, and it seems to me that that is just what the Government wants. It desires to retain sufficient control to enable the Minister to appoint a representative that will suit the big interests which the Bill is designed to protect. No threat was contained in the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition. He simply indicated that if the Ministry intended to oppose reasonable amendments it must be prepared for a fight over the Bill. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> indicated, by interjection, that he considered the amendment an unreasonable one, since the representatives of the soldiers on the Repatriation Commission were elected in a similar way to that provided in the Bill. From the Ministry's point of view, a more unfortunate comparison could not have been made, for it is a moat telling argument in favour of the amendment. The fact that only to-day the association of small pastoralists in the Territory requested the honorable member for the Northern Territory to press his amendment is ample evidence of its importance. The reply of the Minister in charge of the Bill confirms my impression that the measure was not drafted by the Government, but by representatives of the big squatting interests of the Northern Territory at Scott's Hotel. This is not the first time that legislation of this kind has been practically drafted by outside bodies.. It shows that the Government desires to be in . a position to veto the appointment of a person who may be nominated, but of whom they do not approve. They wish to be able to appoint a representative who will, perhaps, be in the employment of the big interests, or who, for some reason or other, is prepared to work for them. The clause deliberately destroys what might be termed a democratic feature of the measure. The Minister will have the final word as to the personnel of the Board, so that a small lessee, conversant with the needs of the smaller men in the Territory, can be precluded from appointment. I have no doubt, therefore, concerning the source from which the measure has emanated, and in whose interests the Government is acting. I fail to see how any one can object to the appointment being made by election. Members of this House are elected. The people whose interests will be affected by the operations of .this Board should have the right to elect their representative. If the Minister persists in his refusal to accept the amendment, his action will he tantamount to refusing to accept a basic democratic principle. He has said that if one man stands out from the others by his votes, the Minister will exercise his common sense and appoint him.. If that assurance can be accepted, the Minister's objection to the amendment falls to the ground. He evidently wants to get control of the three men on the Board. He wants Government interference by a Government that does not believe in Government interference. He wants to appoint two men, and to say who out of another three shall be the third man. With the clause as it is, and with clause 11 in the Bill, there might as well be no reference to1 the representation of the interests of the Northern Territory. We might as well say that the Board shall be appointed by the Minister. The members might as  well be appointed in Melbourne', Sydney, or Timbuctoo. It will be a Board that will perpetuate the chaos and blundering of the past. The speech made by the honorable member for the- Northern Territory is clear evidence of the necessity for a representative of the Northern Territory to be in this' House. No one in the House knew anything about the requirements of the Northern Territory until the honorable member came here.  His  sole object is to enlighten and assist the Government and honorable members in determining questions of this nature. He has given us his opinion, and has substantiated that opinion by a telegram from the only organization, concerned, and yet the Minister tells him that he does not know anything about the subject. If. that is the attitude of the Government, what is the good of. having a representative of the Northern Territory? This is not a party political question. It does not relate to a principle which has been well fought out on the hustings. It is merely a matter of administration, of detailed work, and- the Government will render the Bill valueless if it fails to meet the wishes, not merely of the honorable member for the Northern Territory, but of the people there. This debate has tended to confirm the suspicion that I have felt for a long time, that the Bill is nothing more than an attempt to assist Ves'tey's and other big landed interests in the Northern Territory. The Government, having taken its instructions from those interests, has determined not to budge an inch, whatever proposals may be put forward. It Will have to answer for the consequences. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot recall  a  debate in which there have been so many suggestions of ulterior motives as there have been in the discussion of this Bill. It is astounding that charges of  "boodling  " and* corruption should be levelled by some honorable members- against others. I am astonished- thai; honorable members opposite have remained so immaculate in a country in which', according to them-, there is so much wickedness. I am inclined to think, however, that they are protesting too' much;- in fact, after hearing the speech of the honorable member for the Northern Territory, I am convinced that they are. I ask honorable members to consider for what purpose the Board will be appointed. We are not electing a committee for  at  cricket or  a  football club', but- are considering the appointment of a Board- to perform important duties in the Northern Territory. If honorable members will look at clause 13 of the Bill, they will see that the Board, under the control of the Minister, will be charged with the general administration of this Ordinance relating to the Crown lands of the Northern Territory. Who has to accept the responsibility for the administration of the Territory ? I say the Minister and the Government have to do that. My objection to the clause is that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has definitely promised that if three names are supplied' to him, he will select one of them. Only specialists should' be appointed for this work. They must be able to classify land, and they must be men of undoubted probity. The Minister will have to depend upon them, and' their responsibilities to- him will be very' great. He, and he alone, should accept the responsibility of appointing them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. The Minister stated that the control of the Northern Territory would be placed' under a Board. I find it difficult to understand why two Boards should be considered necessary. The Board will have an enormous amount of work to do in classifying land, and the Minister will have to look to it for advice in opening up and developing the Territory. I have been pleased with the recent reports of the Minister concerning his efforts to develop that country. I am not so optimistic as he is regarding the success of closer settlement, but I believe that he is on the right track. If a Board is to be appointed, the Minister should be responsible. I cannot understand why the Minister should be willing to transfer his powers' to others. </para>

                            <para>- No. It is neither necessary nor .advisable that a man from the Territory should be appointed. The Board will 'have similar functions ' to those of a Court. It will take evidence, and will make recommendations as to the persons to whom leases should be granted ; and it would be improper to have on that Board any man who is directly or indirectly interested in' land there. </para>

                            <para>- Men with knowledge of that type of country should be appointed. If anything goes wrong, the Minister will have to accept the responsibility; it is he who will bc charged with maladministration. The Board will act similarly to Judges and magistrates, and its members should be highly qualified. They should have a knowledge of land to be able to classify it. If any mistake has been made, it has been in the direction of allowing the pastoralists to make three nominations. The responsibility should rest with the Minister. When the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> considers clause 13, which sets out what the Board will be required to do, he must conclude that its members should be appointed by the Minister. </para>
