                    <para>. - With the permission of the House, I should like to make a statement on the financial position. I am happy to say that, owing to the efficient work of the treasury staff, I am able to present to the House an approximate statement of the accounts disclosing the financial operations of the Commonwealth during the past year. These figures are approximate only, and have been built up largely by telegraphic advices from the other states and from London, and obviously can be compiled at this early date under general heads only. The figures may be slightly varied when the accounts of the year are complete, but they are now made available as being substantially correct. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The expenditure of the past year was £63,357,150, which may be compared with the expenditure of the previous year of £63,700,485, and the estimated expenditure of £61,896,098. </para>
                <para>The revenue was £66,014,243, which may be compared with the receipts of the year 1922-23 of £64,720,635, and the estimated receipts of £61,943,250. </para>
                <para>The transactions of the year 1923-24- show a surplus of receipts over expenditure of £2,657,093. </para>
                <para>I present a tabulated statement of the whole of the transactions, under general heads, which has been compiled, and which I should like, with the consent of the Hou3e, to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> The statement i3 as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>With the large increase in the import trade which has developed during the year, the increase in Customs and excise revenue was anticipated. The decrease in the income tax revenue may be largely attributed to the delay in assessing the tax, following on the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Offices. The decrease under interest on loans to states for soldier land settlement is caused by some of the payments being withheld pending a further discussion on the terms of the loans. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The departmental increase shown in this table may be divided into two parts - unforeseen special payments which are not in any way associated with the ordinary administrative expenses of the department, which total, roughly, £466,200, and increases in the ordinary departmental expenditure in the department of the Customs, which was necessitated by the increased revenue collected; in the Post Office, due mainly to expansion of business, and Arbitration Court awards in the Defence Department, in accordance with a special resolution of the Council of Defence ; and in the Taxation Office, clue to delay in completing the amalgamation of the federal and state offices. "Unforeseen items referred to in the expenditure under ordinary votes of departments include the following :  - </para>

                <para>Deducting this amount from the total increase in expenditure, £1,017,000, under the ordinary votes of departments, there remains an increase of £550,800. This increase is made up as follows :  - </para>

                <para>From the foregoing details it will be seen that compensation to South Australia transferred officers, payment to the Central Wool Committee, entertainment of the British fleet, and the Ellis Rowan pictures, account for £236,200 of the total increase. The balance- £32,800- was required for royal commissions, the Australian delegation to the Imperial Conference, and other unforeseen miscellaneous expenditure. </para>
                <para>The increase in the Treasury over the estimate is £412,000. The details already furnished, which show contributions to the Japanese Relief Fund, advances and other recoverable expenditure, interest on moneys advanced by the Commonwealth Bank, and Taxation Office, total £419,600, so that there is a small saving on other votes of the department. </para>

                <para>The expenditure of the Department of Trade and Customs shows an increase of £61,000 over the estimate.It must be remembered that during the year the Customs Department has handled a huge volume of business, which is considerably in excess of that of any previous year. For this reason it became necessary to provide an additional £8,000 for the administration of the Commerce Act and £30,000 for salaries and contingencies generally. A temporary credit to the British Empire Exhibition Trust Account and other recoverable expenditure, total £23,000, making, in all, the increase of £61,000. </para>
                <para>The increase of £14,500 in the Department of Works and Railways is more than accounted for by the additional amount of £20,000 already referred to, which was provided for the working expenses of the East- West Railway. </para>

                <para>The other small increases, totalling £16,540, are made up of losses on the 1920-21 Fruit Pool, of £14,940, where nothing was included in the estimates, and £1,600 for interest on loans raised for the states. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for its investigation and report thereon, viz. : - Establishment of an Automatic Telephone Exchange at Elsternwick, Victoria. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which has been acquired at the corner of Selwyn-street and Davis-street, Elsternwick, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system, having an initial capacity of 5,700 subscribers' lines, with provision for extension to 9,500. That will afford accommodation for prospective development. In addition it is intended to install a heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air conditioning plant. Elsternwick, which is one of the most populous suburbs of Melbourne, is served telephonically from the Windsor, Malvern, and Brighton exchanges. The cost of line plant required to connect subscribers in the district to those exchanges is unduly great, and economy in this respect can be secured only by opening an exchange in the telephonic centre of the area. The net value of the line plant required to serve the Elsternwick area if the exchange be opened in 1926, will be approximately £85,000, but if the establishment of the exchange be deferred, and the practice of connecting Elsternwick subscribers to adjacent exchanges is continued the value of line plant required to serve subscribers in this area will be about £123,000. It is stated that in a multi-exchange network, such as that of the Melbourne metropolitan area, the exchanges should be automatic. So far as the sub-station equipment is concerned, there will be no change in the apparatus of subscribers now connected with the Malvern and Brighton exchanges. The anticipated annual revenue of the new exchange, based upon the estimated number of line connexions on the dates mentioned, is - 30th June, 1926, the proposed opening date, £44,216; 30th June, 1931, £63,000. The proposed building will be a single story brick structure of simple design. The details of the estimated costs are: - Site, £1,000; buildings, £7,000; heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air conditioning plant, and electric light and power, £4,700; automatic telephone equipment and external plant, £155,175: total, £167,875. In accordance with the requirements of the act, I lay upon the table plans and other particulars of the proposed building. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which was acquired by the Commonwealth at the corner of Bay View-street and High Street, Northcote, Victoria, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system, having an initial capacity of approximately 3,800 subscribers' lines, with provision for extension to an ultimate capacity of 9,300 lines. This will afford sufficient accommodation to meet the anticipated development in the Northcote exchange area. The proposal also includes the installation of heating, ventilating vacuum cleaning, air conditioning, &amp;c, plant, electric light and power. The subscribers in the Northcote area are at present served by a manual (magneto) switchboard, but the ultimate limit to which this can be extended in the existing building will only suffice for service to intending subscribers until about June, 1925. It is also stated that in a multi-exchange net-work, such as that of the Melbourne metropolitan area, the interests of economy and efficiency are best served by the installation of automatic telephone exchanges. The annual revenue based on the estimated or actual number of line connexions at the undermentioned dates is as follows, viz. : - Actual, 1922-23, £15,016 ; estimated, June, 1926, £25,631; estimated, June, 1931, £42,347. The proposed building is to be a brick structure of simple design. The estimated cost of the scheme is: - Site, £S94; building, £9,000; installation of heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, air conditioning," &amp;c, plant, electric light and power, £5,100; automatic telephone equipment and external plant, £S6,729; total, £101.723. </para>

I had hoped that the construction of a post office would have been commenced ere this. On several occasions I have approached the Minister regarding the matter, and have been told that plans are in course of preparation. I hope that the* telephone exchange, at all events, will be proceeded with speedily, because it is urgently needed. </para>

                        <para>.- While I congratulate the Treasurer upon the introduction of this bill, I find it necessary to criticize certain of its provisions. There is a good deal of irony in the fact that, notwithstanding Australia's enormous production of wealth, including over £600,000,000 worth of gold,  the public debt to-day is £900,000,000, and all the banks in the Common-wealth are not in a position to finance the coming wool clip. A good deal has been said in the course of this debate regarding the wonderful advances made by the Commonwealth Bank, but I propose to lift the lid off the pot, and show that there is nothing in it but political gas. The Treasurer has stated that the bank has received from the Commonwealth during the last nine years an average of £12,000,000 per annum free of interest. At 5 per cent, that money should have earned £5,400,000, but the profits of the bank during the whole period have been only £4,500,000, notwithstanding the great volume of business which was given to the bank in connexion with the war. If the Commonwealth Government had handed to me £12,000,000 per annum for nine years, I should have undertaken to return a bigger profit than the bank has yielded. The water has boiled out of the pot now! I wish to discuss the note issue." The Labour party was responsible for taking control of it away from the associated banks. </para>

                            <para>- Hear, hear! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WHITSITT.-</inline> The honorable member for Angas will be sorry for that " Hear, hear," in a moment. In acting as it did in that respect the Labour party deprived the people of Australia of the right to demand gold. The associated banks held £200,000,000 in deposits, and the Labour party by making the notes legal tender deprived the people of Australia of the right to demand gold for them. The Notes Issue Board, however, has issued so many notes that the £1 note has new a gold backing of only 9s. 6d. When the associated banks were in control, £1 notes  had behind them £8 in gold, but since then the Notes Issue Board has turned out notes like sausages from a sausage machine. "What about the "Hear, hear" now? I do not hear it. The people of Australia were denied the right to demand gold for notes. Shame on the party that deprived them of it. It has been said that the Commonwealth Government advanced money to the states, and so assisted them. That is so. It has even borrowed £3,000,000 itself. But there is no gold to back up the notes that were issued in connexion with those loans. The notes have only a mythical value, and the sooner those for which there is no gold backing are withdrawn the better it will be. Gold is the citadel of power; it is the backbone power of a nation ; without it wealth becomes the plaything of the savage and the sword of a demoniacal socialism. </para>

                            <para>- Gold is the only thing that can be used. It is the symbol of power. It keeps England afloat. The Mother Country will not allow it to leave her shores at present. She requires it to back her currency. Australia cannot get a single "yellow boy" from England. Every 1,000,000 sovereigns represent £21,000,000 of trade per annum. Some honorable members sa.y that it is all right so long as we get goods in exchange for gold, but I do not agree with them. England will allow as much of her merchandise as we like to come here, but she will not allow her gold to be taken away. If we could get gold we should not be suffering from the stringent financial difficulties that we are now facing. The British Government should be requested to remove its embargo on the export of gold. If we could get more gold we could paddle our own canoe. We have lost £600,000,000 worth of gold through our silly legislation, arid it is time that we put our house in order. The argument that £1,000,000 worth of imported goods is just as good as 1,000,000 sovereigns is foolish. Let us suppose that we obtain £1,000,000 worth of wearing apparel from abroad. Twelve months later the clothing is worn out, and more is necessary. By that time we have lost both our money and our goods. I want sound finance. Issuing notes without gold backing is folly, and the power to so issue them should be taken away from the Government. What does the Secretary to the Treasury know about world finance relative to the business and settlement of exchanges of the various banks trading, say, in Australia with South Africa, the United States of America", France Japan, or anywhere else? He knows as much about them as a child knows about trigonometry. A little learning is a dangerous thing, and some honorable members opposite have very little learning about finance. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased with the proposal that the power to issue notes shall be taken from the Notes Issue Board and given to a board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The members of the proposed board should be gentlemen who are well acquainted with financial affairs, and who know the facts about our Australian trade and industry. They should not be subject to political control, and should only issue notes for gold. It is ridiculous that the Notes Issue Board should have refused to issue notes on the security of sovereigns. A  sovereign  will always buy a note and a little more, but a note will not buy a sovereign. New notes should be issued whenever new gold is offered in exchange for them. Our people should be able to demand gold for notes at any time, but they cannot do so at present. Why should the associated banks be compelled to lodge reserves with the Commonwealth Bank? They should be allowed to retain their money and invest it as they desire, provided that their notes are backed by sovereigns. Gold to back all the notes should be in safe custody. The Commonwealth Bank at present has its clearing house at the Bank of New South Wales. That bank is much stronger than the Commonwealth Bank. The associated banks as a matter of fact have built up Australia, and their system of exchange has been altogether to the benefit of the people. What honorable member who had £100 to collect in Tasmania would think of going across the Strait to get it when he could do so by paying an exchange rate of £ per cent, to the bank ? The system is an excellent one. I go across <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Tasmania every week and pay <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 8s. for the trip, but I assure honorable members I would not suffer seasickness for the sake of collecting money that I could obtain on the mainland by paying \ per cent, in exchange. Honorable members should not decry the associated banks, for they have done a great deal for Australia. They have made possible the investment of money in outside districts and so have promoted development. I have borrowed money from them at 7 per cent, and have made 50 per cent, on it. Will honorable members say that that is not good business? I do not deny that the Commonwealth Bank has done some good, but I think it could have done much more. Money must be made available for the development of Australia, but only under proper conditions. The sane way to conduct financial affairs is to permit the banks to do their own business. The Notes Issue Board should not have been permitted to act a3 it has done. Some honorable members say that it has made Australia blossom like a rose. I would say, like a rose in a bottle of mixed pickles. Men who control financial affairs have to be properly trained to look at things from the bankers' stand-point. When an ordinary man goes to- a banker, and ask3 for a loan, the banker says : "What is your security? We do not advance money on enthusiasm, but on security." That is a proper attitude. It is time we got back to sound finance. The sooner we call a halt in our present practices the better it will <inline font-style="italic">bb.</inline> I do not agree with the suggestion that it will not be necessary for the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank to sit more frequently than once a month. If it is to do its work properly it will need to sit two and even three times a week at some periods, for it must keep in close touch with the exchange conditions of the world and the trade and commerce requirements of Australia. The members of the board must give their whole attention to their work. It is impossible to make a banker in a week or two. Ten or even fifteen year3 are not too long for a man to acquaint himself with the intricacies of high finance. Bankers must be trained like other professional men. If we are ill we want a doctor to treat us, and go to a doctor. If we require surveying done we go to a trained surveyor. If we expect expert banking service we must go to expert bankers. They understand currency affairs and general business practice. Shrewd and capable gentlemen ought to be appointed to this board, and they cannot be picked up in the streets. The board should bend all its efforts to restore the gold standard. </para>

                            <para>- It should be compelled to issue notes for all the gold that is offered as security, and it should require gold before it issues notes. That is the only way to overcome our difficulties. Bankers should control the currency, for they understand it. It is almost laughable that they have been unable to obtain notes on the security of sovereigns. Notes should be issued whenever gold is forthcoming. The associated banks should be permitted to control their own business. The directors of the Bank of Australasia, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, the National Bank, and so on, know their own business better than the officers of the Commonwealth Bank can know it, and they should have power to demand notes for gold at any time. They may be trusted not to call for more notes than are required to provide a proper currency. At present our notes are issued on an absolutely wrong basis. </para>

                            <para>- That is a. silly interjection. Current accounts are not. legal tender. Notes are the first claim on the assets of a bank. Before the establishment of the Notes Issue Board, there was not a man in Australia who, if the banks went smash, could not get a sovereign for every note in his possession. Today, of the £57,000,000 issued as notes, at least £27,000,000 is not represented by gold. What is to become of that £27,000,000 which is missing? It is not here, but is invested in the various states; and -if gold were demanded the Commonwealth Bank would have to put its shutters up. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking about current accounts, but about notes. We cannot make something out of nothing, as that is contrary to the law of nature. Every penny possible should be applied to the redemption of the notes which are not backed by gold, and the British Government should be asked to permit a free currency of gold. If that were done, the people of Australia would not find, as at present, the rate of exchange against them. </para>

People who have no time to study the intricacies of finance, can be forgiven for not understanding the position, but for an honorable member in this House to make use of the statements contained in the speech of the honorable member who has just sat down, is unforgiveable. The honorable gentleman led off by saying that this country owed nothing to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> Bank. . Such a statement can be brushed aside without comment. It impresses itself on no one's mind, and certainly not on the mind of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> Throughout his speech the Treasurer paid a tribute to the work of the Commonwealth Bank. The honorable member for Darwin, by way of showing the private banks in a more favorable light than the Commonwealth Bank, said that the private banks used to hold eight sovereigns for every note they issued. The absurdity of that statement is apparent on the face of it. </para><continue>

                            <para>- Let mo show the honorable member how utterly ridiculous his statement is. Those sovereigns included all the gold held by the banks against all their liabilities. The liabilities of the banks in respect to notes represent about one-fifteenth or one-twentieth only of. their total liabilities. If we accept the view of the honorable member, that the gold held by the banks was a backing for the notes they issued, they would have no backing <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> all for their other liabilities. In view of that, does the honorable member still persist in the views he has expressed? He should take the trouble to look into these matters carefully before making such loose and wild statements. The honorable gentleman asked what would happen if the people with current accounts were to draw cheques and demand payment. He said that, so far as the private banks were concerned, everything would be all right. Let me refer to the Treasurer's speech, and we shall see what would happen if those people presented cheques to the full value of their current accounts. The Treasurer said - </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and if all the people with current accounts presented their cheques and demanded payment at once, they would get 38.7 per cent. of the amount they were entitled to ask for. It is surprising that any honorable member in  this  chamber is unaware of a simple fact like that. No private bank in this country would be foolish enough to say that it could immediately meet all cheques so presented to it, and nobody with any knowledge of the position seriously thinks it could be done. I am surprised that the honorable member for Darwin should be so innocent. </para>

                        <para>When the question of a Commonwealth Bank was first mooted, it was generally expected that a truly national bank would be established - a bank of deposit, issue, discount, exchange, and reserve. When the Bill was introduced, however, expectations were not realized, and when the bank began to function, it became perfectly clear that a national bank had not been established, but merely a Governmental institution in competition with the private banks. The Bill the Government now brings forward is designed to carry out the original expectation. </para>

                    <para class="block">I cannot help thinking that that statement was a cunning attempt by the Treasurer to conceal the real purpose of this bill. The answer is provided by even a surface examination of the bill. The passing of this measure will not effect, anything which could not be done under the original act, excepting the appointment of a board of directors; yet the Treasurer would have the people believe that that for which they are longing is now at hand, namely, a truly national bank. Another answer which appears on the surface, and which is probably the most effective &lt; answer which could be given, is that if this bill were to effect what is claimed for it by the Treasurer, a howl would go up from the private banking institutions of this country. Instead of that, the private banks have, with one accord, given the bill their benediction. When the Commonwealth Bank was established by a Labour Government in 1911, there was an outcry against it on the part of the private bankers, and by the Opposition of that time. If the Labour party were in power to-day, and made the statements which have been made by the Treasurer, the banking institutions of Australia would heap curses, and not blessings, upon it, for well they know that a Labour Government would extend the bank for the people's good. The fact is that since the establishment of the bank determined opposition- to it has been displayed by the party opposite. I will not say that the Government proposes to wipe out the bank altogether, but there is only one reason why it does not do so, and that is because the bank has been such a huge success, and has done so much useful work for the people of this country, that honorable members opposite dare not wipe it out. They know that the people would not tolerate any such thing. But the Government does the next best thing it can do from its point of view, and tries to ham-string the Commonwealth Bank on every possible occasion. The principal feature of this bill is submitted with the intention of so hampering the bank as to make it one that will never function as a really national bank should do. It can safely be said that the Commonwealth Bank has prospered, not because of sympathetic administration by the governments that have been in power since the Labour party lost office, and not because of sympathetic administration of those at the head of the bank, but in spite of their unsympathetic administration. One can imagine what its success might have been if it had been given a fair deal. If, for instance, it had been allowed to handle all the moneys that pass through the state departments, municipalities, and other local authorities, which, in the State of Victoria alone, I venture to say, amount to several millions, it is not too much to say that the Commonwealth Bank would be one of the greatest institutions in the Empire. Surely the people's bank should handle the public funds. But instead of the state departments feeding the Commonwealth Bank with public funds, as they had a perfect right to do- </para>

                            <para>- Exactly . Instead of that, what do we find? Not a penny of the money that courses through the state departments finds its way into the Commonwealth Bank. On the contrary, they put all their money through the private banking institutions. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> has already mentioned, the State Savings Bank of Victoria has £10,500,000 deposited with private banks at rates of interest ranging from 1 per cent, to 5 per cent. I can only say that this is a shameful use of public funds in order to bolster up t he profits of wealthy shareholders in private banking institutions. Quite contrary to what has been said by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, the Commonwealth Rank may be said to have triumphed in spite of the dead weight of its opponents. Up to the present time it has made nearly £5,000,000 in profits for the people. It exerted a steadying influence which, during the war period, saved this country from anything in the nature of a financial panic. The honorable member for Darwin (Mr.' Whitsitt) represents a primary producer's constituency, and a knowledge of what the Commonwealth Bank did during the war period, when the primary producers were largely cut off from their overseas markets, should have prevented him from making the slanderous statements he has made against that great institution. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but such statements are repeated outside, and it is just as well that a reply to them should be placed on record. Wheat was the first great staple product of this country dealt with during the war period, and the first compulsory wheat pool was handled by the Commonwealth Government arranging with the Commonwealth Bank, and to a lesser extent with the joint stock banks, for advances to be made on wheat certificates. Every one knows what was the result of that arrangement. It extricated the primary producers of this country from the dilemma they would otherwise have been in through being cut off from their pre-war markets? </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and at the same time it eased to a great extent the local financial situation. The same system was followed in subsequent harvests during the war period, but after the first wheat pool the Commonwealth Bank, as a Government institution, was placed in the paramount position. It acted as the distributing bank at every capital centre. Although honorable members are aware of the facts, it is just as well that a few figures should be given, to indicate the colossal nature of the work in the performance of which the Commonwealth Bank was the chief instrument. From 1915 to 1921 the wheat yield amounted to 640,000,000 bushels, and realized £185,000,000. So that when I say that the work in this connexion performed largely by the Commonwealth Bank, was colossal, I am not using the language of exaggeration. Throughout the war period it was the great steadying influence of this bank that relieved the primary producers of this country from the very difficult position in which, but for the assistance it rendered, they would have been placed. </para>

                            <para>- It was only the Commonwealth Bank that held the private banking institutions in check during the war. If the steadying influence of the Commonwealth Bank had not been exerted we can imagine what would have happened during the war period from our experience of the private banking institutions in pre-war days, aud when the Commonwealth Bank was not in existence. Speaking of many with whom I have come into contact I can say that the experience of the man on the land of private banks has, in many cases, been a very sorry and sad one. Before the Commonwealth Bank existed they turned many of them out on the roads of this country. If the private banks did anything for the relief of primary producers during the war period it was because of the existence and influence of the Commonwealth Bank. As one who represents one of the biggest wheat producing electorates in the Commonwealth. I say that there is to-day amongst primary producers, and especially wheat farmers, a lasting sense of gratitude to the Commonwealth Bank for what it did for them during the war period. What I have said about wheat can be said also about the handling of wool, meat, butter, fruit, and most of our primary products. This work was done by the Common wealth Bank as the recognized central authority and pivot for the financing of our primary products during the war period. Apart from what the Commonwealth Bank did in the interests of primary producers we know what it has done in connexion with the floating of war loans. The statement has been made, but it will stand repeating, that it saved the people of this country £6,000,000 on the commission charged on the floating of loans. The rate charged by the Common wealth Bank was 5s. 9d. per £100 as against a, rate of £2 7s. Id. per £100 charged by private banking institutions. This represented on Australia's internal war loans a saving to this country of £6,000,000. Yet there are people who to-day will stand up in this chamber and decry the Commonwealth Bank as an institution which the country would have been better without. I did not think that there was a member in this House who would not appreciate the work of the bank, and would not have a kind word to say for it. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> throughout his speech, indicated that the country owes much to the Commonwealth Bank. But what is to become of it now ? I have already said that one does not need to read the bill to know what is intended by it; one has only to remember the acclaim with which the measure was received by the. private banking institutions of the country. It is proposed to hand the Commonwealth Bank over to a board that will certainly not be in sympathy with the expansion of its functions in the interests of the people. It is safe to say that the intention of the bill is that the Commonwealth Bank should in future function not so much in the interests of the people as in the interests of the private banks. The bill is intended as a prop for private banking institutions. As the Treasurer, who introduced the bill, and many members of his party, do not believe in the extension of public utilities we can hardly expect the bill to be designed to develop a national bank in the interests of the people. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer said that he would sell the railways if he had his way. He, at least, could not be expected to bring down a bill to develop a truly national bank, and I am not satisfied that his attitude towards the bank is more favorable than it is towards the railways. There is a great difference between the treatment of the primary producers by the Commonwealth Bank and their treatment by the private banks. In view of that, one wonders how any one claiming to represent the interests of the primary producer can laud the private banks and decry the Commonwealth Bank. I remind honorable members of the Country party that when a proposal was made from this side of the House during the 1921-22 harvest to provide a cash payment of os. a bushel for wheat, an amendment wa3 moved by a Country party member that half the amount should be paid in certificates. The amendment was agreed to against the wishes of the Labour party, and there are many men on the laud to-day who can inform the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitsitt)</inline> that when they took their certificates to the private banks they were charged an interest rate of 7-i per cent, for discounting them. Again, what were men like the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> told a few weeks ago when the question of financing the next wheat pool was under consideration? They were told that the private banks had "finished with them." I do not know whether the honorable member for Echuca would endorse what the honorable member for Darwin has said, but when he placed the private banks on a pedestal he mud have had in his mind the fact that a few weeks ago they would not take part in financing the wheat pool. In so far as the private banks have displayed any willingness during late years to help the primary producers, it has been because of the existence of the Commonwealth Bank. What hope of assistance could be held out for the primary or secondary producers if the Commonwealth Bank did not exist? And yet it is interesting to know the extent to which the private banks hold the people's money. The amount at call on which the banks pay no interest is £123,819,000. Not only do they pay no interest on this large sum, but they charge for keeping the accounts of it. .The amount on fixed deposit, on which the banks pay only a very small rate of interest, is £164,725,000, making a total in current accounts and on fixed deposit of £288,544,000. On about half of that large sum of money the banks pay no interest. Yet, what happens when the banks are asked for an overdraft? "When the request is granted the person requiring the accommodation is charged 7 per cent, and even higher. Surely, considering that the people, as a whole, provide the banks with £2SS,544,000, half of which is free of interest, they deserve better treatment than to be charged 7 per cent, for overdrafts. Even when an overdraft is arranged it merely means that the customer is given the privilege of writing a cheque to the extent of the credit arranged in his favour, and no money passes over the counter. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and the banks will probably advance at the most, only half the value- of the property, and it is the general opinion that they extend their own credit on the balance. I have in mind scores of people, notably in the electorate of Indi, which I once represented, who have been forced off their holdings by the depredations of private banks. I have in my mind at present the case of a man who, in a period of drought in New South Wales, lost about half his stock. Evil days came to him, as they come to many others in this country. He went to a private bank, which allowed him an overdraft. The drought did mot break as soon as was expected, and after being threatened by the bank, he was given a certain time in which to meet the overdraft. There was only one thing that saved him - a Labour Government was in power, and it threatened to introduce moratorium regulations to protect him and others similarly placed. The threat proved effective, and it was the sole reason why he was allowed to remain on his land.  His  subsequent career shows that he was a thrifty, deserving man, and an asset to this country. The short extension of time allowed to him enabled him to recover, and he is now prosperous. I quote that incident to show that the struggling settler owes very small thanks to the private banking institutions of this country. </para>

                            <para>- That is very probably true. At the last election the Country party, to which the Treasurer belongs, went to the country knowing all these things. It knew also that there was a strong feeling in the country districts against the policy of private banks. It was expected to do something, and it framed a platform of fourteen points. I shall refer only to the thirteenth - the unlucky point for the primary producers. The Treasurer said during the election campaign that if the Country party had any influence in the government of this country decentralization would be the order of the day; secondary industries would be established in the country, raw materials would be worked up near the place of production, and a system of rural credits would be established. The primary producer said, " That is what I want," bub while he asked for bread, the party that claims to represent him gave him a stone. This is what was promised in the thirteenth point of the Country party's election platform - </para>

                            <para>- No; the thirteenth point represents the bread that was promised - the bill represents the stone the producers will receive. I have searched in vain for this thirteenth point in the bill. Members of the Country party said that centralization was the curse of the country, but they are now supporting a bill to centralize credit. This is the opportune moment for the Minister to redeem the promise he made at the last election to the men on the land. Birt clearly the man on the laud is to be sacrificed so that the wealthy shareholders in the private banks may be coddled. Great disappointment will also be felt throughout Australia when it is realized that the Government has not seriously dealt with the exchange problem. The bill offers no relief whatever in that respect, although the exchange rate i3 a great handicap to primary and secondary industries. The Treasurer, in his speech, suggested three remedies. The first was that there should be an adjustment of credits due to Australia in Loudon by the liquidation of the Government securities there in lieu of importing goods. Secondly, he suggested a return to the gold standard, but finally he rejected the two foregoing suggestions and submitted a third remedy, which he said he favoured. fie remarked - </para>

In the last twelve months, however, two loans have been floated abroad, one of £8,000,000, and one more recently of £4,000,000. I submit that the Government should set an example to show that it is sincere in its contention that public borrowing should be curtailed. Honorable members expected the Government to bring down some concrete proposal on the exchange question, but the speech of the Treasurer was indefinite and hesitating to a degree. The Minister evaded the issue by saying that he would leave the matter in the hands of the experts to be appointed to the board. In  the event of these experts having no solution to offer the position will be as unfavorable as ever. The Government has merely expressed the pious hope that there may be a curtailment of borrowing. If that is the key to the situation, arrangements should have been made long ago* to have only one borrowing authority in Australia. Should the states take no notice whatever of the Treasurer's advice the position will not be altered in the least. I propose to discuss- another phase of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. I have taken gilt-edged propositions to the bank and they have been rejected. Three or four weeks ago a wealthy municipality required a. loan for the installation of an electric light system. The whole of the assets of the municipality would have been offered as security, but I was told by the Acting Governor of the bank that there was no money available. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> informed lis a few days ago that, he knew of cases in which the bank had declined to advance money, not on the ground that funds were not available, but because it did not wish to compete with the private banking institutions. Several cases in which a similar answer was given have come under my notice. This class of mismanagement is a violation of the very principles on which the bank was established. </para><para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but it is not " playing the game." If those in charge of the bank study the interests of the private banks instead of permitting their sympathies to run along the lines of the bank's progress, they are not fit for the positions they hold. The Commonwealth Bank has made fair progress, saddled though it has been with unsympathetic administration, and one can imagine what progress would have been made under sympathetic control. In my own electorate are many flourishing centres, and yet only two branches of the bank are established there. I believe that most other country electorates are even less favoured. I could name twenty flourishing towns in my electorate where a branch of the bank would thrive, but no steps have been taken, to extend the operations of the institution there. </para>

                            <para>- This demonstrates that the bank is hamstrung by the very people who ought to be extending its ramifications. When t.he authorities explain that they have no money, they demonstrate their own incapacity and prove that they are not launching out to obtain the new business which would provide them with the funds which they say they lack. The managers of some of the branches in the cities and elsewhere are in sympathy with the ideals of the founders of the bank, but those in supreme command are not acting fairly. </para>

                            <para>- If then the Acting Governor is adopting his present attitude of his own free will, his sympathies must lie with the private banks, in whose service he ought to be. When gilt-edged propositions are submitted to those in command they display about as much activity as a petrified elephant. They say either that there is no money available, or that they are not looking for the kind of business submitted. It is deplorable that the bank has been kept stationary in country districts where the people are most anxious to have the facilities that new branches afford. Any development that has taken place, has been brought about despite the unsympathetic administration. If the leading officials have moved slowly in the past, the bill now before us is calculated to make them proceed more slowly still. One can only read into the measure the intention to maintain the Commonwealth Bank as a prop to the private banking institutions. It is not the desire of the people that that course should be followed. Those who originated the bank hope to see a truly national bank established, and developed on national lines. In my opinion, the time is ripe for the whole of the banking in this country to be done through the medium of a national banking system, acting on behalf of the community. </para>

                            <para>- The people of Australia would like to see a real national bank established without further delay. I want to see a nationalized banking system brought about with a mobilization of credits not only in times of war, stress, or trouble, but also in normal times. Prior to the war, people would have ridiculed the idea that Australia could raise the amount of money which was spent on sending troops over seas and on the various activities in which the Government engaged during the war. It was the mobilization of credits that enabled Australia to discharge its obligations ; and nowadays no one wonders how it came about. It is not, therefore, too much to expect that the same thing should be done to develop the Commonwealth in peace time to the greatest possible advantage. The mobilization of credits is not surrounded with that mystery that some people seem to attach to it. After all, credit is the very basis of banking. Banks may have whatever backing they like in the shape of bullion, but it is of little or no use to them without the further backing of public confidence. Credit is simply public confidence. It is depressing to think that in a country in which so many persons are dependent for their very existence upon the sweet will of private banking institutions, instance after instance can be quoted of people being forced out of their holdings because of their inability to get from banking institutions the accommodation to which they were entitled. The absurdity of the position is easily seen when a comparison is made between ordinary traders and ordinary banks. The difference between them is that in the case of the trader the public supplies the business and the trader supplies the goods, whereas in the case of the bank the public supplies not only the business but also the goods in the form of public confidence, without which the bank would have to close its doors. In these circumstances I can see nothing wrong in having a mobilization of credits in a country like this so that what the people create may be used for and on behalf of the people. This can only be done by bringing about a comprehensive nationalized system, of banking. I cannot conceive why so many persons should be at the mercy of private banking institutions. These institutions could not prosper but for the fact that the public supplies that confidence or credit which is their very life-blood. The time is over-ripe for giving the people the control of the banking system of the Commonwealth. The bill offers no measure of relief in this direction. It simply places the people more firmly in the grip of private banks. </para>

                            <para>- That could very easily be provided for. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, who moved the second reading of the original bill, definitely said that the object of establishing a Commonwealth Bank was to set up an institution which would function on the lines I am now advocating. If a Labour Government had continued in office such an institution would have been created long before this, and until a Labour Government comes into power we shall not have a real national bank. This bill offers no hope to any one but the private banking institutions. This is but another proof that the Government are simply out to help only the very wealthy sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- I engage in this discussion with fear and trembling, because I make no pretensions whatever to be an expert in finance or banking. At the same time one has to take as intelligent an interest as one can in important matters of this kind, and I have read the bill very carefully and listened attentively to some of the speeches that have been delivered upon it. I was particularly curious to learn exactly what is the gravamen of the charge which the Opposition has to bring against the bill, and I find, upon a careful perusal of the speech' made by the Leader of- -the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that his main complaint is that the measure represents a dastardly attempt on the part of the Government to kill the Commonwealth Bank. He says that the effects of the amendments proposed will be to enable [76] the directors of the Commonwealth Bank to assist private banks in- which they are interested to such an extent that it will be discounting their bills and leaving itself without any security. </para>

                            <para>- To the best of my recollection, the Leader of the Opposition said that the bills of the private banks will be discounted by the Commonwealth Bank, and that that will lead to an accumulation in the private banks of a mass of notes for which the Commonwealth, will have no security. It is difficult to understand what the Leader of the Opposition means by that charge. Therefore, I have carefully considered each amendment contained in the bill, asking myself, " How can this proposal possibly have the effect which the Leader of the Opposition predicts? How will this amendment tend to kill the Commonwealth Bank? . How will it tend, as the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> so weirdly said, ' to scientifically strangle ' the Commonwealth Bank?" Whilst the Leader of the Opposition says that the object of the bill is to kill the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> says, " On the contrary, the Commonwealth Bank is not fulfilling the functions for which it was originally  Resigned,  and my amendments are intended to enable it to do so." In order to judge between these conflicting contentions I have referred to the speech of the then Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Andrew Fisher)</inline> when moving the second reading of the original bill in 1911. The gist of the right honorable gentleman's remarks was this, "We see from the prosperous returns of the private banks that there is room for another bank, and we think this a favorable opportunity to establish a Commonwealth Bank that will transact the Government's business, and also engage in ordinary banking." Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> proceeded to express the hope that the bank would develop into an institution dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and other such liquid securities, and eventually become a bank of banks, and not a mere money-lending institution. Certainly it was in the interests of the people that the bank was to be established, and if there was a tendency on the part of the private banks to charge excessive  rates of interest the Commonwealth Bank, whose main object would not be to make profits, would be a wholesome check. At the same time there is on record the expressed hope of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> that in time the Commonwealth Bank would become a bank of banks. There is not the slightest doubt that the framers of the original bill, in setting before them that ideal, had in mind the Bank of England; they evidently looked forward to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would become practically what the Bank of England is to-day, an institution which by its very constitution gives stability to the whole banking system of the country. That is what I found when perusing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> speech. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> said that the object of the Government in submitting these amendments is to carry out the intentions of the framers of the original bill, and to bring the bank one step nearer the ideal of the original founders - to make it a bank of banks. In discussing this question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> did not anticipate the time when the ordinary private banks would be dispensed with and a national bank substituted. He certainly did not use the term " national bank " or " people's bank " in any such sense; but looked to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would really be a central bank - as the Bank of . England is - giving stability and unity to the whole banking system of the Commonwealth. I now wish to deal with the amendments proposed by the Treasurer, and to ask this question in regard to each one of them: "How can this particular amendment in any sense upset or strike at the foundation of the Commonwealth Bank, or tend in any way to strangle the bank's operations?" It is exceedingly difficult to discuss a somewhat intricate and important problem of this nature without the aid of notes, and I have to depend upon my memory to keep the amending proposals in their consecutive order as far as possible. If members of the Opposition say that their charge is that the Government are introducing amendments the object of which is to strangle the bank, the only fair way in which to meet such arguments is by taking the amending proposals separately in order to see in what way any single one tends in that direction. The first proposal is the substitution of the board of directors for a governor to control the Commonwealth Bank. How can that amendment, if carried into effect, tend to strangle or in any way curtail! the operations of the bank? I return to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> speech again, and I find that when discussing the question of the management of the bank, he said, in effect, that the future of the bank would depend upon the Governor and the way in which he shaped. He said, in effect, " We make the constitution of the bank, we place the Governor there as director, and upon the manner in which he acts depends the future success or otherwise of the bank." I quite agree that the success of such an institution depends entirely upon the governor in charge. The same process of reasoning must be applied to the proposed substitution of a board of directors, which is to include the acting governor If we are to assume that the Government are famously going to place upon the board either idiots or criminals, there is no hope for the bank. If, on the other hand, we admit that in the interests of the country and of the bank the Government will make the wisest possible selection, and secure the services of men representing various interests, there can be no objection to the proposed alteration. I assume that the Government will  make a wise selection. What has been said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and those who think with him? As I understand their utterances, they believe that the men representing the pastoral and agricultural interests will in some way get at the bank. I believe the charge in this connexion is that these men will dishonestly use their positions as directors to obtain from the bank financial assistance for institutions and undertakings in which they are interested, and for which they will offer no sound security. </para>

                            <para>- Men in the bank! The Leader of the Opposition admitted that the private banking institutions of Australia arc being conducted on a sound basis, and if those institutions on whose directorates are representatives of important interests are well managed, there can be no objection to representatives of similar interests being included in the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. I fail to see how, in regard to the first amendment, which relates <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the substitution of a board for a governor, it can be shown that such an alteration would strangle the bank. After all, if it means that the directors are going to lend the money of the Commonwealth Bank without security - it seems that is about all it can mean- </para>

                            <para>- I was not dealing with that aspect of the question. The second amendment proposed is that the capital of the bank shall be increased. Under the original bill provision was made for a capital of ?1,000,000, but in 1914 an amending bill was passed in which power was given to increase the capital to ?10,000,000. That power has never been exercised. This bill leaves the capital at ?10,000,000. How can it be said that that will tend in any way to strangle the bank or hamper its operations? It seems to me that it will put it in a better position to fulfil the functions which it was intended by its founders to fulfil. That point surely requires no elaboration. The next amendment proposed is that the Commonwealth Bank shall have power to fix and publish its rate of discount. I suppose that that power exists now, although no act of Parliament definitely provides it. I have no doubt that the Treasurer has proposed this amendment as a step towards ultimately making the bank a really central bank in every sense of the word. The practice in the Bank of England is, I understand, for the court of directors to meet weekly on Thursdays to fix the rate of discount for the coming week.' The Commonwealth Bank will follow that practice if this amendment is agreed to. I do not see how it can be suggested that we shall even hamper the bank, much less kill or strangle it, if we adopt the proposal. The fourth amendment provides that the private trading banks shall be compelled to effect their exchanges through the Commonwealth Bank by drawing cheques and paying into it. That is another step towards making it a central bank. " The present system of effecting exchanges is a pooling system. A daily balance is made, and adjustments follow by the giving and taking of certificates. The proposal in the bill is that the private trading banks shall furnish the Commonwealth Bank with regular returns. It will then be in a position to know exactly to what degree it can help the private banks by giving them accommodation from time to time. This power will also help it to function more effectively. The last amendment provides that the banks shall furnish statistics to the Commonwealth authorities as they now do to the state authorities. That also will tend to centralization. I have examined these amendments carefully, and I must confess that I cannot see how they can do other than increase the usefulness of the bank. I certainly fail to see how they will diminish its usefulness or curtail its operations in any way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher stated, in the speech to which I have already referred, that he hoped the day would come when the Commonwealth Bank business would be largely dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and liquid securities of that kind. If the bank, by having a large fund at its disposal, is able to help the private banks by rediscounting  their bills of exchange, it will do a great deal to assist the country. The private banks frequently bold bills which they wish to convert into cash, and" if the Commonwealth Bank can rediscount them and give accommodation it will be altogether to Australia's advantage. That will render them more efficient, and stimulate their activities. I have listened carefully to the speeches that have been delivered by honorable members in this debate. Those by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning),</inline> the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> were interesting and instructive, and so was the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> But when honorable members are asked to deal with plain, practical suggestions such as are contained in the bill, I cannot understand why they should think it necessary to discuss the general question of exchange, the advisableness  of a return to the gold standard, the effect of our fiscal policy on the exchange situation, and like matters. Those are important and interesting subjects, but they do not affect the bill. When I was giving consideration to the plain, simple questions in the bill, I asked myself, "Do I believe that the effect of these amendments will be to increase the usefulness of this fine institution?" I have come, after a careful consideration of all the facts, to the conclusion that it will be, and, therefore, I shall support the second reading of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- That there may be honest differences of opinion on this important measure no one can gainsay. I intend to vote for the amendment of my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> The Commonwealth Bank started as no other bank in the world started. I refer honorable members to the valuable report of the commission that inquired into banking problems in the United States. I believe that, with the exception of myself, the only other honorable member who has read the evidence and finding of that commission is the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline> The commission inquired into the banking systems of the world, and dealt exhaustively with the constitutions of the Banks of England, France, Italy, Spain, and Russia, not one of which is constituted in quite the same manner as the Commonwealth Bank. The Bank of England enjoys certain privileges, including the issue of notes, for the management of the national debt. .Ti was called upon to finance the debt created by Charles II., of anything but sacred memory. The history of banking is almost a romance for those who care to study its pages. On a former occasion I pointed out how, at an early period in the history of banking in Victoria, it was possible for any money-spinner who could command a sum of ?125,000 to start a bank in this state. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely. It already appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in the report of my speech on the original banking bill. I pointed out then that any money spinner with the sum of ?125,000 could have started a bank in Victoria and obtained authority to issue an unlimited number of notes. Those honorable members who, like myself. are getting on in years will remember the position when all the associated banks in Australia. - there were no fewer than 87 different banks then - had authority to issue notes. Very few people could give, off-hand, the name of the bank whose notes they carried in their pockets. I recollect, on one occasion, walking down Collins-street with a friend, and putting questions on this point to a number of persons whom we met. Not one person in the twelve whom we questioned could say what bank had issued the notes which he was carrying. All they knew was that they held bank notes of a certain denomination. As a result of all this confusion, after the Australian-European Bank failed, the notes issued by that bank were passing as currency throughout the back-blocks of Australia for over 25 years. Honorable members will, I am sure, agree that with so many different banks of issue, it was much more difficult than at the present time to detect forgery in notes. The practice of the Bank of England is never to allow a note returned to the bank to go back into circulation, so that if any forgery is attempted the authorities know at once. When I was in the note issue department of a private bank the practice was for one office.r to call over the numbers of the notes returned to the bank, while another officer checked the call in the ledger. If the same number reappeared, the practice was to examine the note carefully under a microscope and ascertain if it was genuine or a forgery. . If it was genuine, the presumption was that the note of the same number previously returned must have been a forgery. </para>

If honorable members desire the information concerning the position in Victoria during the time of which I speak, I refer them to my remarks in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I claim credit for having been the first to reveal the danger of one bank being able to issue an unlimited number of notes.

                    <para class="block">When we transferred to the Commonwealth Bank the right to issue notes, the note issue of that bank became the safest in the world. No other form of security had a prior claim on the assets of a bank in this state. I would prefer to see the note issue under the control of the Government, but probably this House, in its wisdom, will decide to leave them under the control of the Commonwealth Bank. If the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, which has done splendid work in other directions, had been followed in connexion with the building of the note printing office, probably upwards of ?40,000 would have been saved. Section 14 of the act from which I have just quoted reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is not possible to-day, because one of the greatest arguments in favour of the Commonwealth Bank is that we have taken away the right of the other banks to issue notes. The result is that the credit of the community is now much higher. I have seen in Collins-street crowds of people waving bank notes, and threatening to go' to the banks, to demand payment in gold. 1 was able to stop the base desire of one man who wished to ruin the banks. At that time the directors of the banks were trembling for fear of what might happen. But such a state of affairs is impossible now. There is no Australian but has faith in the Commonwealth Bank. I care nothing for the returns of the Bank of England, where the note issue is placed in one column, and the gold issue in another. Back of the notes, there are the huge amounts represented by the current accounts, deposits at call and at interest, We can rightly claim that the Commonwealth Bank has worked splendidly, and that it has avoided the dangers and pitfalls of the past. In this chamber, on a previous occasion, I drew attention to an iniquitous provision in relation. to the savings bank whereby a wife has no claim on the bank if her husband steals her bank-book, forges her signature, and obtains her money. </para>

If permitted, I shall quote from his scheme for adjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the states. The extract is not long, and I shall give it to the House as a monument to King 0'Malley's great work, this being the first opportunity of doing so as the Commonwealth Bank Act has not previously been brought before honorable members for amendment. It indicates, in many ways, the unfortunate position existing in Victoria, New South Wales, and every other state where the state savings bank is in absolute competition with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0'Malley's</inline> scheme been carried out as he desired, there would have been no competition whatever between them. In addition, the erection of splendid buildings in Elizabeth, Swanston, and Collins streets, all carrying on the savings bank business, would not have been necessary and the states would have been partners in the profits made by the Commonwealth Bank.

The great Napoleon, in those days, allowed the issue at 4 per cent, of small bonds, each equal in our money to £4, and which on one occasion fell in value to 50 francs. By following the splendid example of France, a thrifty nation, and adopting a similar system of bonds here the people would have the opportunity of saving money in small amounts. In connexion with the savings bank branch of the bank's operations, I should like to make one more quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley. He said- </para><quote>
                        <para>I have for years advocated that there should be a Commonwealth Bank, and drafted the scheme adopted by the Brisbane Conference. Well, we have got a start - wo have a Commonwealth Bank, thanks to the Labour party - but I want more. I want that bank to be an institution which will help the farmer with cheap money, and will not call in the loans when times are bad and he needs the assistance most. This is- no visionary idea. It has been done in other countries. In New York, for instance, they are adopting the rural credits system to give cheap money to farmers on longtime overdrafts. </para>
                        <para>In order for the bank to become great a Board of Management should be appointed, consisting of the Governor, representing the Commonwealth, and one representative from each of the subscribing States, who should represent the States Savings Banks, the Governor possessing a casting vote.

                        <para>In France and Germany the small farmers can borrow all the money they require at 3 per cent, to 5 per cent., payable by small instalments over a term of about 50 years, or sooner if they wish. The greatness of these countries is largely due to the prosperity and independence of the small farmers, and I want to see a similar state of affairs here. The land and the : workers of a nation are its real source of wealth, and are entitled to more sympathetic treatment than they have had in the past. Not only should they be assisted to produce, but to market their produce. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">I have given my meed of praise to a great man whose financial acumen was exercised for the benefit of Australia.  His  endeavours to secure the establishment of a national bank for the Commonwealth were unceasing in the party to which he belonged, but to which I am sorry to say he does not now belong. That party adopted his views, and carried them to fruition under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher. There is one flaw in the existing Commonwealth Bank Act, and attempts were made in this House to rectify it. We should have consolidated the savings banks of the states with the savings bank of the Commonwealth. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> meets with my full approval. As a youngster I served in a bank for about seven years, during a period of eleven years. In the case of an ordinary bank, in selecting its directors the first man looked to is the biggest shareholder of the bank, and then any man of wealth, squatter, or merchant may be called to the board. But, after all, we know that the conduct of a private bank is left to the manager. In nine out of ten private banks it is the practice of the directors to say, " Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manager."</inline> I remember that on one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> Smith, who was a bank director here for 20 or 30 years, attended a meeting of bank clerks held in the Temperance Hall. He did not know that the clerks in his bank were called back to work at night. I told him so from the platform of the hall, and I said, " If you will walk down to the bank with me we shall find them working there." He was astonished to find them at work, and he said, " I never knew they came back." We need financial experts on the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. It differs from any other bank in the world. It is a bank of issue and deposit, and at the same time a savings bank. I can remember that 50 years ago there were penny savings banks in the Old Country, and at one time there was a post office savings bank in Victoria, but never so far as my reading goes, has there been another bank like the Commonwealth Bank, at the same time a savings bank and a bank of issue and deposit. The Leader of the Opposition has given a great deal of thought to this subject, and I am sure he will agree with me that we should have on the directorate of the bank, an expert in savings bank business, who should have control of that department, subject, of course, to the governor. The directors should give the whole of their time to the work of the bank. They should not be half-time men. I hope we will not appoint to the directorate "guinea pigs," such as are many of the directors of the private banks. I have little doubt that the Commonwealth Bank will ultimately become the greatest banking institution in the world, unless other nations follow our example in the establishment of similar institutions. The Commonwealth Bank is certain to increase in power and influence in the community. The directors should be financial experts, and where in Australia can we better secure such men than from amongst those trained in our banking system? Who could be better fitted to be a director of the bank than one who has successfully passed through the different grades in its service? There could, of course, be no objection to the appointment of a heaven-born, genius of finance, wherever he might be found. Very few merchants dealing in bills of exchange know very much of the intricacies of the law pertaining to such instruments. I remember that. as a youthful officer of a bank I was somewhat of a favorite with the merchants, probably because I was so small, and on many occasions they wrote questions which they asked me to give to the accountant to answer for them. I mention this to show that as a class, merchants cannot be regarded as financial experts, though there are, of course, amongst them men of great financial knowledge. That can be said of every calling. We know that many pawnbrokers become financial experts, but they are not the type of men we want on the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the bill, that is not to say that there is no good in it. I think there is much that is good in the bill, but honorable members on this side quite definitely desire that the Commonwealth Bank should be an institution not only for the conduct of higher finance, but for the benefit of every person in Australia. The great Bank of France in the old days used often to have in reserve, two, three and four times the amount of gold deposited in the Bank of England. Yet the Bank of France used to discount half-crown bills, for even two weeks, or sometimes for one week. The officers of the bank would go around and collect the money, deducting a very small rate of commission. The rate of the discount of the Bank of England would go up and down like a see-saw, while the rate of the Bank of Prance was steady. I am speaking, of course, of pre-war days. Paris was the steadiest money market in the world, not even excluding the wealthy New York Exchange, because the Bank of France was based upon the interests of the common people of the country. Members of this House, although possessing good securities, have been refused overdrafts. No one knows how much money has been lent to private firms. Parliament should stipulate that not more than £100,000 should be advanced to any firm or individual. "We know how Lord Rothschild defeated a great opposition house that up to a certain date held sway in England. He was  chairman  of the Bank of England, and the whole thing was settled as if it was a very small matter, but even the Bank of England had a severe shaking. A proposal to limit the amount of advances to individuals and companies would be endorsed by a board of experts. People who knew something of the inner working of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's mind say that he had good margins of securities. A large sum of money should be advanced to assist the states, the municipalities, and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Bank should assist the Commonwealth Government as it did in the war years. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller said that if called upon by the Commonwealth Government he would be prepared to organize the finance of Australia in peace time as he had done it in war time. It will be remembered that during the war bonds amounting to £350,000,000 were issued. Is it not better to lend £100,000 to 100 families than to lend it to one individual ? Cheap money distributed over a large number of people will do more good than if placed in the hands of only a few. It is the duty of honorable members to improve the bill if possible. I understand that the Treasurer looks upon it as hi3 pet ewe lamb. The greatest stumbling block to the development of the Commonwealth Bank is the competition between its savings bank branch and the state savings banks. Those two banks pay different rates of interest on savings bank deposits, and a further difference is introduced by the Commonwealth Bank giving 3 per cent, on deposits of £1,000. In former days the rate of interest in the state savings bank o? Victoria was kept low to force depositors to use the associated banks. Even the State Government, which in a few hours will be no more, has lodged a sum of £10,000,000 with the associated banks. I would make it compulsory that all municipal, state, and Commonwealth funds should be deposited in the Commonwealth Bank. A directorate such as is suggested would probably agree to all the gold in the country being lodged in that bank. I hope to have the assistance of honorable members in inserting a clause to prevent nepotism. One firm should not be allowed to do all the architectural work for the bank. If the object is to adorn the big cities of Australia with beautiful buildings, we should hold competitions in which all Australian architects can compete. If that is done correctly-designed buildings will in the future decorate the cities of this beloved Australia. </para></speech>

                <para>I desire to inform honorable members that the Government is now in a position to announce the names of Australia's representatives at the next Conference of the League of Nations, which is to be held in September. Those representatives will be <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom (Commonwealth Attorney-General), <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> (Leader of the Opposition), and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook (High Commissioner for Australia in London). I think that the delegation that it is proposed . to send on this occasion will command the very greatest confidence of the whole of the people of Australia. Its composition will demonstrate that the part taken by Australia in the League of Nations is not influenced by political considerations, and is not a matter upon which there is any division among the people. In addition to those three delegates, it is also proposed to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. E.</inline> F. Allan as a substitute delegate. </para>
                <para class="block">I also desire to make a statement to the House with regard to an application made recently by the Australian Meat Council to be granted a bounty on the export of beef and live cattle. The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning)</inline> raised this matter two days ago, and I then said that I hoped the Government would be in a position shortly to make an announcement. During the year 1922, bounty to the extent of £123,000 was paid on frozen and canned beef and live cattle exported, and during 1923 the sum of £141,000 was paid as bounty. In regard to the bounty on beef exported, inquiries showed that the prices which the growers were obtaining were higher this year without a bounty than they were last year with the bounty. The difficulty specially brought under notice by the council related to the meat exported from the Wyndham works in "Western Australia, from which place the freight was1/8d. higher than it was from other parts of Australia. Under all the circumstances the Government has decided that it is unable to approve of a bounty on beef exported, or of special treatment being given in regard to any particular port, and it is suggesting to the Australian Meat Council that they endeavour to arrange for a reduction of freight from Wyndham. It has been made plain, however, that there is an opening for the establishment of a satisfactory trade in the export of live cattle, and as the Government is anxious to safeguard and increase this trade, it has approved of the payment of the bounty of 10s. per head to be continued this year on the terms that have operated during the last two years. It is estimated that the export will total 10,000 head of live cattle, on which the bounty to be paid will amount to £5,000. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to call the attention of the House,  ."anil particularly of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)_,</inline> to the serious industrial position that has arisen in the important town of Kalgoorlie. Without any previous intimation a cablegram was recently received from the London directors of the Ivanhoe mine announcing that it was proposed to amalgamate that mine with the Lake View and Star mines and shut down the Ivanhoe mine. It was, of course, beyond the power of anybody in Australia to prevent that being done, and the result is that 500 men have been thrown out of employment. For every miner in Kalgoorlie four other people are kept employed in various avocations there. If no employment can be found for the miners a loss of 2,000 in the population of the town will be sustained. Three hundred of the 500 men are married. The Western Australian Government has done everything it possibly can to alleviate the situation. The Premier visited the gold-fields, and 100 men were given work along the water supply main. Fifty more were absorbed in other mines, leaving a balance of 350 still unemployed. Kalgoorlie, through not having any surrounding wheat-growing country, is in a particularly unfavorable position to provide work for such a large number of unemployed. These men have their homes established in Kalgoorlie, and they naturally require employment in the district. Acting on a <inline font-style="italic">teiegra.ni</inline> I received from the Premier of Western Australia, I interviewed the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> and suggested that the men should be employed on the ballasting of the transcontinental railway. The Minister pointed out that the £50,000 allocated for that work for this year had already been exhausted. I therefore approached the Treasurer to find out whether a further sum could be made available, and he replied that he could not see his way clear at the present juncture to make a further grant. I wish to emphasize the point that not more than half the ballasting work has been done, and it is essential that the whole of the line should be ballasted. At the present rate of progress it will take nine years to complete the work. Seeing that honorable members on the Opposition side of the House have on various occasions assisted the Government to relieve other indus tries, I hope that a sum will be promptly set aside to enable these men to secure employment near their homes. Only Y0 men are now employed at the Woocalla  Quarry in connexion with ballasting operations, and about 30 men are engaged in rail-lifting. They are all employed at the eastern end of the line, while none are employed at the Kalgoorlie end. The State Government is doing all that it possibly can in the matter with its limited resources; and, seeing that the ballasting work must be done, I hope that the Government will make a sufficient sum available for the purpose. The men for whom I speak do not ask for soup kitchens or food; they are industrious people, and they simply want work. The present time of the year is ideal for ballasting operations. It would not be necessary to ballast the whole of the line immediately, but if the work is put in hand forthwith these men will be placed on their feet and the fear of starvation will be averted. </para>

                    <para>I have to bring under your notice the condition of sixteen New Guinea natives at present engaged on the New Guinea Steamship Company's vessel, the <inline font-style="italic">Kavu.</inline> It would appear that these men do not receive proper food, housing, &amp;c. It seems that some days they only receive two meals comprising rice (without sugar, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.</inline> ), and bread without butter. Perhaps every third day a 2-lb. tin of meat is given to be divided among the sixteen, Now and then tea is given, less milk, and with very little sugar. There is no proper sleeping accommodation provided for them. Some sleep on deck beneath an iron enclosure (enclosed on three sides), others sleep in the holds. They have about three blankets each, very poor ones at that, and complain bitterly of the cold. They state that the vessel " makes plenty water," and appear very much afraid of her. They are emphatic on this, and say they want to go back on the Burns, Philp <inline font-style="italic">Mataram.</inline> As far as I am able to gather they receive about 7s. per month.
