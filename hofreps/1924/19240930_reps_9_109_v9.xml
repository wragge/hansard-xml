                        <para>- My department is using Australian material wherever possible. During the last two years it has used, for the first time, Australian lead-covered cables. The insulator position became very critical at one period, and the department was compelled to import a small number of A type insulators. The difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of insulators for telephone and telegraph purposes throughout the Commonwealth during the past two years has caused the department serious embarrassment, and in a large number of instances wires have had to be slung prior to the supply of the insulators in order that the work of gangs might continue. The orders placed outside Australia during the years 1922-23 to 1924-25 were as follow: - </para>

Throughout this period the  department had adopted every possible means to induce contractors to speed up their -work, but nevertheless there was a very serious set-back during the months of December, January, and February. The total deliveries for that quarter reached only 522,944. In consequence of the serious dislocation of departmental operations resulting from the failure of supplies, and iii order to minimize further inconvenience in the execution of departmental works, supplementary orders for 300,000 insulators were placed abroad in February, 19^4. Of the total insulators required for 1924-25, rather less than S per cent, were ordered from overseas, arrangements being made to ensure delivery early in the financial year, with a view to overcoming the disabilities resulting from insufficient deliveries from the normal sources of supply.  During the past twelve months the undermentioned orders have been placed with Australian manufacturers : - </para>

The department is quite satisfied with the Australian insulators, and as many of them as possible are being used. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - The Customs Tariff Act provides that goods, the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and shipped from the United Kingdom to Australia, shall be admitted at the rates of the British preferential tariff. Hitherto goods have been regarded as being the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom if British labour or materials constituted 25 per cent, of their factory cost or works cost. In the case of goods containing British labour or materials which are exported to a foreign country and undergo in such country a process of manufacture and are then returned to the United Kingdom for further manufacture, only such British labour or material as is added after their return to the United Kingdom is taken into account in calculating the proportion of 25 per cent. When, however, all the processes of manufacture have to be carried out in the United Kingdom, admission is allowed at British preferential tariff rates even though the proportion of British labour and material is less than 25 per cent. For instance, an article of jewellery wholly made in United Kingdom from raw imported gold would get British preferential tariff rates, although the value added by British labour might be less than 25 per cent, of the factory or works cost. These conditions have been in force since the introduction of preference to the United Kingdom in the year 1907, and similar conditions are adopted by the other dominions as well as the United Kingdom. They likewise apply to the Commonwealth's tariff agreements with New Zealand and South Africa. For some years past the Government has been giving very serious consideration to these conditions, and as a result of investigations made has come to the conclusion that they are pressing hard upon some Australian industries, especially textiles, iron and machinery, and call for drastic alterations. When goods are exported direct from continental countries to Australia the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act supply a means of protecting our industries from the cheap products of these countries by the imposition of dumping duties, and these provisions have undoubtedly often prevented serious detriment being caused to our industries by such importations. But when goods of continental origin are imported into Great Britain, under present conditions the addition of 25 per cent, to their value by British labour or materials entitles them to admission into Australia at preferential tariff rates. They not only gain thereby immunity from dumping duties, but also* actually get the benefit of the lower rates of duty on goods of British produce or manufacture. Consequently, it will be seen that the present conditions of preference virtually give a premium to the use of continental labour and materials in Great Britain, to the detriment, not only of Australian industries, but also of the industries in Great Britain producing all British goods. And this is not the only objection. There are many classes of materials that can only be obtained in continental countries. If an Australian manufacturer imports them, he must pay the rates of the general tariff, whereas a British manufacturer can import the same materials, submit them to a process of manufacture which constitutes a mere 25 per cent, of the value of the finished goods, and then get them into the Commonwealth at preferential rates. During the Prime Minister's recent visit to England, the subject was discussed with representative British manufacturers, and after full consideration they thoroughly agreed that it was essential, in the interests of British as well as Australian manufacturer, that some alteration should be made. The suggestion that the proportion of British labour and materials required to qualify for preference should be increased from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent, was very generally accepted, subject to the modification that in the case of goods in which all possible processes of manufacture had been performed in Great Britain a lower proportion might be required. In view of the fact that all the dominions have been acting hitherto on a uniform basis in this matter negotiations were initiated, as a beginning, with New Zealand, for the purpose of making a general alteration. These negotiations have now been brought to finality. The Prime Minister of New Zealand has expressed his agreement with the necessity for an alteration, and has agreed that the percentage of 75 per cent, should be adopted. After mature consideration of the subject, the Government has decided to tak© the following action: - As regards goods which are partially manufactured in the United Kingdom, the requisite proportion of labour and material entering into the goods to entitle them to British preferential tariff rates will be raised from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent. Where, however, it is claimed that all possible processes of manufacture have been performed in the United Kingdom, subject to that fact being established to the satisfaction of the Minister as a result of inquiry and report by the Tariff- Board, admission at British preferential tariff rates will be allowed, provided, however, that under this clause no goods of a class or kind made or produced in Australia will be accorded the preference unless at least 50 per cent, of the works or factory cost consists of United Kingdom labor or material. Under this clause, British newsprint would be exempt, for the reason that there is no industry of the kind in Australia. If the proportion of British labour and material in British newsprint should be less than 50 per cent., it would still come into Australia under the British preferential tariff, provided that all possible processes tff manufacture have been carried out in the United Kingdom. In regard to goods which have a£ some stage entered into the commerce of, or have undergone a process of manufacture in, a foreign country, and have been returned to the United Kingdom for the completion of manufacture, the total value of the labour and material which was expended in the United Kingdom will be taken into account and not as at present,  merely that portion which is added after their return to the United Kingdom. The existing conditions that the final process of manufacture must be performed in the United Kingdom and that the goods must be shipped from the United Kingdom to Australia will be maintained. The action necessary to give effect to the alteration will be taken by the making of a regulation under the provisions of the Customs Act, and in order that due notice may be given to all concerned of the changed conditions, it is proposed to bring the new arrangement into operation on the 1st April, 1925, that being the earliest date possible, in view of the changes that will be entailed. The altered conditions of preference will also apply to the reciprocal tariff agreements with New Zealand and South Africa. Action will be taken immediately to notify the authorities in the United Kingdom,, and also all the other dominions. </para>

                    <para class="block">The necessity for this bill, relating to the valuation of live stock for the purposes of assessments of income tax, arises from a recent judgment of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Cameron</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Tasmania.</inline> The appellant returned his live stock at values which were below the departmental standard values, on which the Deputy Commissioner had assessed him. He thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Tasmania on the ground that the values he had placed on his live stock were correct, and his appeal was upheld. During the proceedings, counsel for the appellant raised the contention that inasmuch as the departmental standard values differentiated between stock in one state and similar stock in another, they were unconstitutional and invalid, and that, such being the case, no live stock could be brought to account from July, 1917, to June, 1921, because there was no valid value prescribed-, as the act of 1918 directed. These legal points were referred  to  the High Court, and upheld by it. The effect  of  this decision is that in the assessments for the years from 1915  to  1918 live stock must <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> brought to account at their market values. For a number  of  years the value  of  live stock was continually increasing, and if the owners were compelled  to  pay taxation according to that increasing value they would be obliged to pay taxation on stock some  of  which died in the subsequent period  of  drought. That would be a great hardship. In addition  to  that, for the period 1918-19,  to  1921-22, live stock could not be brought into account at all, according  to  the High Court judgment. </para>
                    <para class="block">For the first three years the application of an assessment on the basis of the market values would operate harshly on live stock owners, for market values were on the up grade, and no drawback would be given in respect of losses through droughts. In the next four  years,  the exclusion of live stock from their returns would throw the owners back on a cash basis for the purposes of assessment; that is, the stock would be taken into account only when it was actually sold, and, in some cases, would not be taken into account at all. The Government is taking action now to save the revenue from the liability of refunds claimed on technical grounds; to remove possible hardship on stock-owners; and to give an option to stock-owners to have their past assessments maintained or amended on a market value basis for all years. The bill provides that if a stock-owner so elects, within three months he may bring his stock into account at market value; but if he does not so elect, past assessments will stand. He must send in notice within three months if he wishes for a re-assessment. </para>

I think, therefore, that three months will be sufficient time to give them to make their election. The right's of the appellant Cameron were of course, safeguarded in respect of the period covered by the appeal, but he will have the right to make his election as to the other years. I trust that the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

                        <para>. - In 191'8 a new method of assessing the value of live-stock was -adopted by this Parliament, which was to be "as prescribed." The Commissioner  of  'Taxation promulgated regulation No. 315, which differentiated between the value3 of stock in the various states. That regulation operated for four years, and was universally regarded as being approximately reasonable, for,- under it, stock in  Queensland,  for instance, was not worth as much as stock in New South Wales or 'Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> objected to the departmental valuation of his stock. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">He said that his stock, in Tasmania, were worth less .than the sum set down by the commissioner., and he appealed to the court asking that his values, and not those of the department, -be taken. The court decided, first of .all, that the department had no constitutional right to differentiate between stock in the various states, and having prescribed an invalid system of  valuation  there was no basis on which live stock could be -taken into account .at all during a. period of <inline font-style="italic">four</inline> years. The  court  said that in those cases live-stock would have to be taken  into  account 'On the basis of 'their cash value when  sold,  -no deduction being provided for, as previously. It is  problematical  - .and I trunk this is the general opinion throughout Australia - whether anybody will benefit by that decision. Most stock-owners think that they will suffer through being forced back into that position, having to take the value of their stock into account at the price at which it was sold. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> of course, is entitled to 'the fruits of his legal victory. I understand that the 'legal position is that, .for the actual year of his assessment, he will .not , have to pay the tax. All other stock-owners  will have the right to -elect whether they will take their stock into account .at its market value or accept  the  departmental  valuation.  There is no question of depriving anybody of his rights. I take it that the -honorable member for .Boothby  suggests  that those who lodged objection to -the assessment should mot :be compelled ,to pay the tax. </para>

                        <para>.- The position is not quite clear to me. The  honorable  member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> endeavoured to ascertain what would be the position of those who had -paid taxes that they legally need not have paid. Will they be entitled under this hill to a refund, whether they lodged objection to the assessment or not? I take it that this Parliament desires that all taxpayers .shall be treated -alike. Seeing that a re-assessment of the value of livestock throughout Australia is involved, it appears  to me to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> questionable whether we can pass a completely validating bill. The regulation which enabled differentiating values to be fixed simply meant that stock-owners were obliged to fake their balance-sheets. I have mentioned this matter previously. I always protested against the values assessed by the department, for I knew, better than the department, the value of my stock. The department never even saw the stock. But it arbitrarily fixed its value, thus faking my balance-sheet, which had been properly prepared. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> is a public benefactor, and the committee . should  now put the matter on a basis that will be permanently satisfactory. Livestock should be taken into account at its value, like any other chattel. It would be better still to adopt a cash basis for the value of live-stock. </para>

                    <para class="block">In doing so, I desire to point out that last year we altered the method of assessing the value of live stock, and gave three options. Those three options still remain. This bill is to revive the acts which were repealed in 1922. That is the reason for bringing it forward as a separate measure. It gives two options where previously there was only one. A person may accept either the valuation of the department, or the market value. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill has been introduced in fulfilment of a long-standing promise. It was not brought forward earlier, because it is complementary to measures which must be passed by the State Parliaments. It is the state -acts that will really be the operative measures, the bill now before the House being, to a great extent, a machinery measure to give to the meat -council an Australian-wide authority, in stead of merely local authority. In September, 1922, the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> summoned a conference of those engaged in the meat industry. It met in Melbourne, and was. attended also by representatives from each of the states of all parties interested. After the war there was a severe slump in meat, and the industry was in a very unsatisfactory position. At the conference the establishment of a meat council was. agreed to. The council was to inquire into all questions that concerned the meat industry - particularly the reasons for the unsatisfactory position which then existed, and the means by which the industry might be benefited, chiefly in the direction of finding markets and improving the marketing system. As the matters dealt with by the council are primarily of state concern, the proposal is that the council shall be financed by a levy which will be made by the states on the raisers of meat. The only fund which the council will have at its disposal will be the moneys derived from the levies made under the state acts. Should the states all pass the necessary legislation, state boards will be set up, and levies made, to enable them to carry out the duties entrusted to them. The idea underlying this bill is that the state boards shall not act independently, and that there shall be also a national meat council, which will consider the meat industry from the Australian standpoint. This national council will act in co-operation with the state boards. No levy will be made under the Commonwealth' legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth has no actual security. This bill is an attempt to assist the meat industry to ascertain in what direction existing methods can be improved. Already the council has done some useful work. In considering the position of the meat industry in Australia, the council must take into consideration, not only the time that Australian cattle take to mature, but also the longer period occupied in the transport of meat from Australia to the world's markets as compared with transport from the Argentine. The meat council has already made certain recommendations to shorten the period of transhipment overseas. I recommend the bill to the House. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. Its purpose is primarily to remove some of the weaknesses in the amendments passed last year, and to place a few patches upon certain loopholes in the existing act. But this measure makes no attempt to deal with two vital matters, one being the remedying of existing injustices under the act, and the other the lessening of its complications. In measures such as this there are two things to aim at - simplicity and equity. </para>

                            <para>- They do not. Very often the striving for equity adds to complication.' I am sorry that the bill retains the inequitable provisions of the act, and that it also adds to the existing complications. For these reasons I am forced to criticize it. I support it because it raises the exemption and strengthens the law in regard to the protection of the revenue. In discussing this bill, it is just as well to take warning from the manner in which another bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act was introduced last year. That bill was introduced in the dying hours of the first period of this session. During a discussion, commencing at 2.45 a.m., and ending during that sitting, drastic amendments were made to the act under the constant fall of the guillotine. We on this side vainly protested. Most honorable members present were lying asleep on the benches. Honorable members should not be in a state of physical exhaustion when considering important amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. Such methods simply mean that the departmental officers prepare measures, Cabinet considers them, and then they become the law of the laud. It is government, not by parliament, but by bureaucracy. We are reaping the fruits of this procedure, because the bill has been introduced to remedy the evils and defects of the rush legislation of  last year. The proposed amendments are urgent and serious, and -because of that the bill must be passed. Were it not so late in the session, and were it not for the need to strengthen immediately the existing law, I should move an amendment referring the bill back, so that the Government might come down with a comprehensive scheme to simplify taxation, and to render it more equitable. I fear to take that risk because if the House -carried the amendment - and one should not submit amendments unless there is reasonable hope of securing their adoption - and we lost the measure, the Treasury would be deprived of a considerable amount of revenue by a number of sharp people who have been evading their legitimate taxation for some time. I notice that the bill is to  be  made retrospective. That is necessary. Although one may object on principle to retrospective legislation, yet, because of the rush methods adopted last year, it is necessary to make the provision of this bill retrospective. That I also support. Wherein did the amendment of the act last year open the door to evasion and injustice? In the first place, the rate of company taxation prior to last year was 2s. 5d. in the fi on the undistributed profits of the company. Last year that rate was abolished, and there was substituted for it a rate of ls. on the whole of the profits of the company. So long as we have individual income tax rates running up to 5s., Gs., and 7s. in the £1 and a company rate of ls. in the £1, so long will individuals be tempted to bring their income under the company rate to .evade the higher personal rate. That is what has happened. Notwithstanding the warnings given when the bill was under discussion last year, it went through, and as a result quite a number of bogus holding companies were formed for the purpose of evading income taxation at the personal rate. Although this measure is designed to remedy that defect in the law, I firmly believe that if the differentiation in the rate of taxation be continued other schemes will be adopted to evade taxation at the higher rate. Section 21 of the act provides that if a company distributes less than two-thirds of its profits to its shareholders the Commissioner may determine if the amount undistributed, or any sum not exceeding two-thirds, could reasonably have been distributed. This is a  very  wide 'discretion to give to the Commissioner or <inline font-weight="bold">Ms deputy,</inline> and whilst I cast no reflection upon the honour of any individual, I emphasize that this House ought to be careful not to place in the hands of any official discretionary power to remit taxation to the extent of thousands of pounds, and, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of pounds. There is provision in the act that if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner or his  deputy  he may refer his case to a board of appeal, but if the Commissioner errs on the side of leniency there is no check. No doubt honorable members are aware of the discussion that has taken place recently concerning the evasion of taxation by certain companies. I expected that the Treasurer would have laid <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> stress on this point when he was moving the second reading of the bill, and that he would have exposed the methods adopted by these holding companies to -dodge taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Every one who has had anything .to do with income taxation knows that for a long time past a- considerable number of people have been evading income taxation. For this reason the Government ought to have introduced this bill earlier in the session. The registration of holding companies for the evasion of taxation is no new device. They were in existence before the amending legislation was passed last year, and the only  effect  of that measure was to provide a greater incentive for their multiplication. Let us examine the methods adopted, taking as an illustration a trading company showing a -profit of, say, £60,000. Instead of paying income taxation on that amount of profit or on the proportion which the Commissioner deems should be distributed, a holding company is formed for the purpose of holding the profits or investing them. The profits not having been distributed, the Commissioner may intervene, and under section 21, determine whether a sum not exceeding two-thirds of the taxable income of the company could reasonably have been distributed. He may resolve to follow these profits to the shareholders only t» find, in all probability, that the principal shareholder is a. holding company liable to taxation) at the- company rate of ls. in the <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> Thus, the shareholders in the trading' company- pay  taxation  at the- company rate. In. view of what has happened! I am glad that the bill now under consideration is to be made retrospective. I doubt, however, if the Treasurer will be able to get the whole of the lost revenue because once a fish gets through the net it is- not so easy to catch it again. These holding, companies may, in the meantime, have been dissolved'; the shareholders- may have disappeared ; some of them may have gone insolvent. The report of the Income Tax Commissioner discloses a significant and considerable increase in the number of companies. I find that in the year 1920-21 the number of individuals who paid income taxation was 548,076, and in 1922-3', 464,298, a decrease of 83,778. I find also that in 1920-21 the number of companies that paid' income taxation was 4,743, and in 3922-23, 5,405, an increase of 662. What has been going on is obvious. I may Be asked', " What can a company do with its pro-fits if they are not distributed among their shareholders?." The profits may be disposed of in various ways. The money may be carried to the reserve fund, and utilized- in the expansion of the business; it may in the following year bc returned to the shareholders in the form of bonus shares free of income  taxation  ; or it may be invested in bonds, or some other security and; return profits to the shareholders. In. view of the. facts- I have outlined,, the question naturally arises whether this amending legislation! will overcome the existing difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- Not if distributed out of reserves. If out of current profits they  can  be taxed-. I am showing what can be done* by refraining from distributing, profits. While the Commissioner can tax the undistributed profits' at ls., in the <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> there- is always a desire on the part of a&gt; company to keep in hand as long as possible a large amount of the undistributed profits', because then only taxation at the company rate has to- be paid. By forming another company to which the profits can be passed on, or can be deemed to have been- passed on, the shareholders- pay tax on their share of the profits at the rale of Is. in the- £1, instead of at rates- varying from perhaps 5s. to, say, 7s. in the £1. We have now to consider whether the proposed amendment of the existing law will prevent evasion in this way. The amendment is contained in clause 6. Unless a person has made a thorough study of income tax legislation for a considerable period,, even after reading the clause ten times, he will not be able to thoroughly understand it. Numerous complaints have been made concerning the employment of taxation agents, but without the assistance of a person skilled in interpreting our taxation law,- many taxpayers would be at a great disadvantage. In effect, the amendment to the existing law is to provide that a shareholder in a holding company shall be deemed to be a shareholder in a trading company in which the holding company holds shares. When the Commissioner of Taxation finds that a trading company has not distributed two-thirds of its profits, and that a portion of them has been, paid to a holding company, he can ascertain the names of the individual shareholders, in the holding company, and tax. them as individuals. That is what is intended, but I believe that objective cannot be achieved. One would not be so foolish as to be dogmatic in matters' of this kind, but I suggest, for the consideration of the Treasurer, that there is nothing to prevent a trading company forming a number of holding  companies,  which may be designated " A," " B," " C," "D," and so on. The Commissioner of Taxation may deem that two-thirds of. the profits of a trading company have not been distributed;, he cannot interfere under the act in regard to any larger proportion. He finds that the profits are held by a holding company which may be " A," in which a company known as " B " holds shares, and when further investigation is made it may be found- that those holding shares in " B " have an interest in " C," and so on. What would be the position of the Commissioner in such circumstances ? He would have to ascertain the profits obtained by individual shareholders in the different companies, and would probably find, that some of the holding companies also held shares in scores of other trading companies. Such ag exhaustive analysis would add to the existing complicated position. As a holding company is a registered company, it is entitled to all the privileges enjoyed by all other registered companies. If a company can hold in reserve at least one-third of its profits, and more if the Commissioner permits, I submit that a holding company can also claim to hold one-third of its profits in reserve. </para>

                            <para>- A trading company might make £60,000 in profits. If it did not distribute any of its profits it would pay ls. in the £1 on them, but if it did distribute them to its shareholders they would have to pay at rates which would vary according to the . total amount of their incomes, and might be in some cases as high as 5s. or 7s. The Commissioner might say, I deem £40,000 - or two-thirds - of these profits to have been distributed for the purpose of taxation. But the distribution might have been to a holding company which, in turn, had distributed to another holding company, and so on, until, under the provision which allows ls. in the £1 to be paid on the undistributed proportion of the profits, practically the whole amount had been paid for at that rate. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. That is the position in which we are placed. By imposing a company rate at ls., hundreds of thousands of pounds arc lost. As I have shown the manner in which the payment of taxation may be avoided, I trust the question will- be carefully considered by the committee. The shares in a trading company may be held largely by a holding company. That holding company may hold the bulk of the interest in twenty other trading companies, and it will be necessary to estimate the proportion of each shareholder's interest in all of those companies. To do so will work out something like this : shareholder Brown has a certain interest in holding company " A," which has investments in twenty trading companies. Brown's individual income must be assessed upon his proportion of the holding company's interests in the twenty trading companies. The staff of the Taxation Department .will have to be increased rather than decreased in order to cope with the work that will thus be thrown upon it. Confusion will be worse confounded. It may be said: "It is very easy to criticize, but you should suggest what ought to be done." That is what I propose to do, and I hope that it will not be regarded as presumptious of me. I think that I shall not be adjudged guilty of that when I tell the House that the suggestions I intend making are not novel or original, but embody schemes that have been adopted by other countries, or that have been suggested after very exhaustive investigation of the subject by the royal commission. First of all, let me emphasize the inequity of the present system. If a company has the right to reserve at least one-third of its profits, and upon that reserve to pay a tax of only ls. in the £1, why is not a private firm given the same privilege? Take two big drapery establishments, each making a profit of £20,000 annually. One is run by an individual, and his profits are taxed at the individual rate of income tax. On the other side of the street a similar business is run by a company. At least one-third of its profits can be carried to reserves, and upon that the company pays a tax of only1s. in the £1. Will any honorable member argue that that is equitable ? If a company can, by placing certain of its profits to reserves, escape the individual rate of taxation, why cannot a private individual have a reserve fund similarly treated? Every day there are probably half a dozen registrations of new companies. On one day last week a family in Victoria registered seven new companies in its own name. It is obvious that the object is to avoid not only income tax but also land tax. It is a well-known fact that companies have by such methods evaded the payment of land tax, yet there has been no amendment of the law to prevent them from doing so. We should treat all alike; we should not have one law for a company and another for an individual. Companies now pay a tax of1s. in the £1 upon all profits. Those of its shareholders who would be non-taxpayers if they had a similar income from any other source are compelled to pay that1s. in the £1 under the law as it now stands. That is not equitable. A man may have shares that return him £50 a year. He has no other income, yet he is called upon to pay an income tax of £2 10s. in company taxation. If his income from those shares amounts to £100, his tax is £5 a year. The smallest income receiver, if he receives his income from dividends, has to pay an income tax of 5 per cent. That is a higher rate than honorable members are called upon to pay in respect of the salaries that they receive. Surely, no one can claim that that is equitable. I 'have said that the company tax is1s. in the £1, and that the individual rate is paid on the dividend. Then there is a rebate of1s. in the £1 to those who receive their dividends, provided that they are income taxpayers; but there is no rebate to those persons who would not be income taxpayers if their income were not derived from shares in a company. Under section 20, sub-section 3 of the act, permission is given to a company to deduct the tax of1s. in the £1 from a shareholder's dividends whether those dividends are allotted to preferential or to ordinary shares. There again honorable members will see that the small shareholders are being hit in order to relieve the big shareholders from the necessity of bearing their proper share of the amount required for the government of this country. Prior to the amendments that were made last year the tax on reserves was 2s. 5d. in the £1. A company that made a profit of £60,000 could carry to reserve the sum of £20,000. At 2s. 5d. in the £1 the tax on that was £2,400. At the present time, at1s. in the £1, the tax is £1,000. That loss of £1,400 is made good by taxing at the rate of1s. in the £1 a large number of small shareholders who should not be liable to pay any tax, because their incomes are well within the exemption. </para>

                            <para>- It pays £1,000 on the £20,000 in reserve. The £2,000 that it pays on the £40,000 is rebated when that sum is distributed. By that means revenue is lost, and the deficiency is made good by taxing the small shareholder at the rate of1s. in the £1. A rebate is allowed only to those who are taxpayers. If a shareholder's taxable income is less than. £200 - and if, under this amendment, it is less than £300 - no rebate is allowed. If one is only a small taxpayer one's rebate will be very small; the full rebate is not allowed until the income is about £600 a year. It is argued that the smell shareholder does not pay the tax; that it is paid by the company. That is a foolish argument. Anything the company pays must be made good by the shareholders. If a shareholder does not pay the tax, why is a rebate allowed to big shareholders of the amount that the company pays ? </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I frankly admit that I have stated extreme cases in order to emphasize my point. Take a proprietary company comprising two groups of shareholders. To simplify the matter I shall call these shareholders "A" and "B". "A" is a small man whose total income is represented by what he gets from the company. " B " has interests in scores of other concerns. The total profit is £1,200. The company tax upon that sum at the rate of 1s. in the £1 is £60. " A " holds a one-fourth and " B " a three-fourths interest <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> the company. "A," whose total income is £300, pays a -tax of .£15, .as his share of the 'company tax. " 33 " pays £45 as hie share of the company 'tax. .But because "B" is ;a big income taxpayer with an interest in -other companies he has the whole of that £45 rebated; whereas " A," because he is a small man with no 'Other income, is not allowed any rebate. That is the -first illustration of injustice. It was pointed out last year, but no notice was taken of it. </para>

                            <para>- Of course he does. He cannot dispute it. The only .argument he -can -use against it is to say that the company pays the -tax, but it pays it, as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has just said, with the shareholders' money. X direct attention to another phase of the matter to show how ,an -even greater injustice takes place. I .take (again, for the purpose of illustration, two shareholders in a company making £1,200 profit. " B ", holding .a three-fourths interest, can out-vote "A". He says, " We will not distribute any of the £ 1,200 profit. We will keep it in the - company, .or invest it for the benefit of the company."  His  reason for refusing to distribute the profit is that he does not want to pay -'5s. in the £1 tax .on it. He out-votes " A "., and the £1,200 profit is not distributed. Then the Taxation Commissioner comes along, and he  says, " We  must  get some revenue from this company in addition to the company tax." He deems that two-thirds of the profits of £1,200 .has been distributed, and proceeds to tax £800 as distributed profit. Of this amount " A " is credited with £200 and <inline font-style="italic">" B "</inline> with £600. As " A " has only £200 income and is therefore exempt from income tax, he is not charged tax. " B ", the Commissioner finds, has an income of £10,000 or £12.000 besides the £600 deemed to have been distributed to him from the company's profit. When that is worked out the tax chargeable on it is about 4s. in the £1. It may not be exactly 4s. in the £1, but I use that figure for the purpose of illustration. The Taxation Commissioner applies this rate, less ls. in the £1 rebate, already paid by the company, and finds that the tax which "B" should be called upon to pay is £90. </para>

                            <para>-Yes, but added to the £1-0,000 or £12,000 income from other sources it 'brings "B's" rate up <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> about 4s. in the £1. He gets a rebate of ls. and is taxed at 3s. in the £1, making his additional tax £90. Here is where the in: justice comes in. Having ascertained that "B" should pay this £90, the Commissioner says, "You have to pay £90 more tax because I deemed that £600 of the profits of your company were distributed to you," but he collects it from the company and not from the individual " B ". By collecting it from the company, the' unfortunate "A", who is .a shareholder with " B " in the company, has to pay one-fourth of the amount, or £22 10s., as his contribution to lighten the burden .of the big man. Not only (has the small man who should be exempt from any taxation to pay his share of the company's taxation, but he has actually also to pay a share of the rich man's income tax. That is about the -most inequitable .arrangement ever -put 'before the country, but it has stood since 1922, when it was first introduced by the then honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who was at the time Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I hoped that some attempt would be made to remedy that injustice, but there is nothing in this bill to remedy it. If we divide a company into a greater number of sections it will be found that -the injustice is only increased. I have taken the example of a small man associated in a company with a big man, but we know from our own experience that there are a great many small .shareholders associated with numbers of very wealthy men in different companies. It will lie found La every instance -of the kind that .the system of taxation adopted operates to the detriment of the small shareholder who happens to be associated with wealthy men ki .a company. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so.. The Treasurer has the choice of three methods, each of which would be less, complicated, less costly, and more equitable, than that now adopted. I take the illustration, for instance, of a company of five shareholders, each of whom holds an equal number of shares. Its. profits are £1,500. It distributes none of its profits. The Taxation Commissioner deems that two-thirds of the profits, or £1,000, has been distributed, and he follows the distribution to each individual shareholder. He says to each, " You have received in dividends £200 from this- company," and in each case he adds this amount to the individual's private income. He find's that "A" has no other income, and, therefore, has no additional or any income tax to pay. " B," " C," " D," and " E," have each from other sources an income of from £10,000 to £12,000 a year. The Commissioner finds their -average tax would be about 4s. in the £1. He says to each of them, " Adding the £200 which I deem to have been distributed to you from the company's profits to your private income, I find that you should pay at the rate of about 4's. in the £1, less ls. in the £1 rebate of what the company has paid, and so you have to pay an additional £30." Four times £30 is £120,. which is collected from the company.. The company has paid1 at the rate of ls. in the £1 on' the £1,500 the sum of £75, making, a total tax of £195. The Taxation Commissioner does not tax the four partners, " B," " C," " D," and " E " to the amount of £30 each. He cannot do so under the act. He must take <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> from the company. He takes it from the company, and the whole of the shareholders, having equal shares in the company, must pay an equal share of the tax, with the result that the unfortunate " A," whose total income is his dividend of £200 from the company, has to pay one-fifth of the £120 and one-fifth of the £75' company tax, or, altogether, £39 out of his total income of £200'. That is the sort of thing which is possible under the existing law. What remedies can be suggested? There are three ways in which companies could be taxed, more equitable and more simple than that which has been adopted. We could adopt the English system. I do not support it, but I submit it to honorable members as an improvement upon what we' have. The English system is fairly simple. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a flat rate- of 6s. in- the £1 on all companies' profits. Then a rebate is given to every person who receives a dividend of fis. in the £1, whether he is taxable or not taxable. All he has to do is to produce his dividend warrant from the company, om. which is written.-, " This dividend has paid 6s. in the £1 tax.'' When the taxpayer is assessed he gets that 6s. rebated. If a man is- in receipt of an income below the amount exempted from income taxation, he can still present his dividend warrant and get his 6s. in the £1. rebated from the amount of tax paid in his name. Most companies pay dividend less tax, so. that a dividend which would otherwise be £1, is only 14s. Under the- English system the shareholder who has. contributed his quota to the taxation of his company gets his rebate when the dividends are taxed. That is equitable.. It may be said that a large number of people in a small way are unaware of their rights uncle,r the law, and. make no claim for rebate. They suffer an injustice in that way, but it is due to their own carelessness; and latterly there has arisen an army of taxation agents who- are making a good thing out of the collection of rebates payable over a number of years. It may be argued that under this system a lot of taxation is collected and is then refunded, but it could be placed to the credit of a trust account, and need not be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                            <para>- No. Every company is treated in the same way, and there is no incentive to form a holding company to cheat the revenue. A dozen holding companies might be formed, but still 6s. in the £1 has to be paid on the profits made by a company. That would be an improvement upon our system} but I do not advocate it, for various reasons, I remind the Treasurer that the royal commission that made exhaustive inquiries during a number of years into the question of income taxation, submitted two alternatives to the Government. Speaking from memory, I believe that the taxation commission was' unanimous on the principle that income taxation should be imposed on individuals and not on corporations. One method of taxation it proposed was to tax the whole of a company's undistributed profits and reserves at 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d. in the £1, and when those reserves were distributed to the shareholders in the form of dividends to rebate the company. What was happening under the provision which imposed a tax of 2s. 5d. in the £1 on reserves, was that when reserves were distributed a rebate was made on the individual dividend, but the small shareholder who had not to pay income tax received none of the rebate. The royal commission said that that was not equitable, as the company had paid the tax on the reserves, and the rebate should be given to the company that paid it, and not to individual shareholders. Another proposal was made in another portion of the taxation commission's report which is equitable and simple. It is to consider a company just as one would consider an individual trader. There should be no tax on profits as the income of a company, but the tax should be imposed on the individuals receiving the profits. </para>

                            <para>- We have many wealthy men in the community drawing big dividends from companies operating in Victoria whose maximum income tax is ls. in the fi on the profits of the companies in which they are shareholders. They are not taxed at all on dividends which they receive from the company, and the ls. in the £1 imposed on the profits of the companies is paid by the companies. The royal commission said that wc should not tax income at the source, but in the hands of the recipients. If a company made a profit of £20,000, the Taxation Department need, not bother about whether it has been distributed or not; it can deem that it has been distributed, and then follow it into the hands of the individual shareholders, and tax them at the rate applicable to their individual incomes. I know that arguments may be urged against this system. It will be said that companies must keep reserves for the purpose of increasing stock, or replacing plant, and so on; but an individual trader, although he must keep reserves for the same reason, does not get exemption from income taxation in the same way as a. company. If he makes a profit of £20,000, it is taxed' as income, although he may not use it all as personal income. If he forms his business into a company, and gives his wife, his sons, and his daughters, shares in it, he can escape with a tax of ls. in the £1 on one-third of the profits. Why should the Parliament differentiate between a company and an individual' trader? Why should we not treat a company as we treat an individual ? The effect of adopting my suggestion would be that we would get more revenue, and would be able to adjust taxation more equitably for the man who! does not float his business into a company. My suggestion would be practicable and equitable. I would move an amendment in the form of an instruction from this House to the Government to adopt my suggestion, but I fear that if I did so the bill might be lost. Because of the good that is in it,  I do not want to lose it. Some of the proposed machinery clauses are very necessary. It will effect some improvement in the taxation of companies, and is one step, at least, in the right direction. I hope I have not wearied honorable members with the3e intricate and involved questions. I have expressed views that I have formed by reading the reports of royal commissions, and endeavouring to evolve an equitable and simple system of taxation. I direct the Treasurer's attention to the fact that in section 21 of the existing act no date is fixed on which the Commissioner shall deem that two-thirds of the profits are distributable. That omission, which causes a lot of confusion, can be corrected when we are in committee. Revenue we must have, and the taxes to produce it should be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear them,. The evasion of taxation by the formation of companies can be overcome by adopting any one of the three suggestions I have made. 1 prefer my last suggestion, which was to treat the companies on exactly the same basis as individual traders. That would avoid all the complications that are now introduced. The Commissioner has the power, not. only to examine the profits of a company, but to  order as much less than two-thirds of the profits as in his opinion is justified to be distributed. The items that can be excluded from the category of distributable profits would amaze honorable members. In the Senate on the 24th August, 1923, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> 'said that the Commissioner has treated as not being distributable - </para>

                        <para>.- This bill, the Treasurer has said, is designed to explain and clarify the law. In some respects it is open to grave doubt whether it attains that object. It makes important changes in the law, and I hope the House will not take it for granted that it merely expresses in clearer language determinations at which Parliament has already arrived. Very important changes are made, which may or may not be desirable, and I want honorable members to realize that some of them are retrospective. With much of the very lucid speech of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> I agree, but I am unable to accept his view that it is right or proper for Parliament to pass retrospective taxation legislation. Only in very exceptional circumstances can such legislation be justified. It is more important that this Parliament should be absolutely fair_ to the citizens of Australia than that it should collect by hook or by crook every possible penny. When Parliament is considering a taxation bill it has the assistance of officers of  the  Crown Law Department and the Taxa-tion Department, and it should make its legislation clear.- Citizens are entitled to act on its legislation. They have acted upon it in the matter of taxation, and it would be a very serious thing now to require people to pay taxation which this .Parliament has said they need not pay. Certain distributions of moneys have been made upon the assumption that they will not be taxed, because this Parliament has so declared. That has been going on for two years, but now a bill, saying that the law is doomed to be otherwise than it has been for the last two years, is brought down. People wj.ll be required to pay taxation on moneys that they have probably spent. I submit to the House, with some confidence, that such a measure is unjust, whether it is applied to a poor or a rich man. Section 16 of the principal act has appeared in various forms in our Income Tax Acts. It is the section under which questions have been decided by the courts regarding the taxation of bonus shares. The' 1922 Income Tax Assessment Act provided that there should be included in the taxable income of a taxpayer - </para>

                    <para class="block">This Parliament in that year used the phrase " capital assets " for the  purpose- of  indicating  the source of  dividends  or bonuses that should not be taxable in- the hand's- of shareholders-. It is proposed to substitute for those words, " Assets which were not acquired for' the purpose of resale, at a profit." That is . not an- unreasonable legislative- proposal, but either the- proposed word's mean the same as the existing words, or- they mead something, different.

In 1922 this- Parliament deliberately- enacted that taxation should be paid' only on the face value of bonus shares representing the' profits- returnable- in the current assessment, and that other bonus shares- issued in- respect of profits should not be taxed. Because of the existing legislation, during the past two years companies throughout Australia have distributed to their shareholders additional shares by way of  capitalization  of profits ..

It cannot be said, that paragraph, <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> will have the- same effect as. the short and' simple provision in the 1922 act; it is an entirely new provision, and it is made retrospective. When examining paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> in detail, particular attention might be paid to subparagraph 3. It will be observed that that sub -paragraph- is- an exception. The clause provides- that the paid up value of shares shall be taxable except the profits (3..)_ derived by the- company during the financial!, year commencing on the first day of. July, one thousand nine hundred! and twenty-two, or during an accounting period' substituted therefor by theCommissioner under section 32 of this act, or in any subsequent financial year or accounting period, and upon which the company is not required by the Commissioner to pay tax or additional tax under section 21 of this act. </para>
                    <para class="block">As sub-paragraph 3 is an exception, the last sentence of the paragraph is an exception upon an exception, and appears tome to mean that if a company has been required <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pay tax under section 21, the shareholder also will be taxed in respect of the same profits. That seems a remarkable provision; and I ask the Treasurer to consider whether the words employed by the draftsman carry out the real intention of the Government. Subparagraph 4 of the same clause contains words which I am sure will cause a great deal of difficulty. It refers to profits - standing to the credit of profit and loss account, or any similar account, on 1st day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fourteen. </para>

                            <para>- Simpler wording will obviate a lot of difficulty and confusion. Ever since this income taxation has been imposed by the Commonwealth, exemption has been allowed on profits earned before 1st July, 1914. That exemption was perfectly fair, and people have worked on the assumption that they were free to enjoy such income free of taxation. This bill does not preserve that exemption, but makes taxable moneys earned and set aside for distribution prior to the 1st July, 1914. Surely that is unfair. No honorable member can think it right to tax moneys earned prior to the introduction of Commonwealth income taxation. Most of the other matters to which I desire to refer can be dealt with more appropriately at "the committee stage. The only exception is clause 14, which provides for the reference of certain questions to a member of a board of appeal. The boards of appeal constituted under the act have important judicial functions to perform, and are superior to the Commissioner, inasmuch as they may review his decisions. Clause 14 proposes to allow the Commissioner to refer a matter to a member of a board of appeal, and require him to investigate it, and make a recommendation to the board, of which the Commissioner is a member. I question whether the Commissioner should have power to direct a member of a tribunal, whose functions include the reviewing of his decisions, to undertake investigatory duties for the purpose of making a report to the Commissioner, as  chairman  of the Appeal Board, which report the Commissioner may or may not accept. This seems to be putting the members of the board of appeal in an improper position. It would be better if the duties proposed to be referred to a member of the board were performed by the board itself. </para>

                        <para>..- As the bill contains some very useful amendments of the income taxation machinery, I intend to give it my support. Some of the amendments were desirable. For instance, clause 3 proposes to give exemption to - the income derived by a person from the working of &amp; mining property in Australia principally for the purpose of obtaining gold- this exemption shall apply to dividends paid by a Company out of such income. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The gold mining companies throughout Australia have experienced adversity in recent years. During the war period, owing to the marketing of their products having been controlled by the Commonwealth, they lost, approximately, £3,000,000, representing the greater amount which they would have received if they had been allowed to sell their gold in the open market. Clause 8 proposes an amendment to section 24 of the principal act in order to increase the exemption from £200 to £300, less £1 for every £3 by "which the income exceeds £300. I hope that every honorable member will recognize that that amendment is justified. Having regard to the increase in the basic wage and the high cost of living, incomes up to <inline font-style="italic">£300</inline> should be exempt from taxation. I hope that the Treasurer will also accept the amendment, which will be proposed by the honorable member for Maribymong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> to allow of a further deduction for medical and funeral expenses, namely - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para class="block">I have always thought that the taxpayer should be allowed to deduct expenses of that kind. There are many persons receiving wages or small salaries who, on account of illness or deaths in their families, are required to pay away a big proportion of their incomes. The amount paid away in this direction could reasonably be deducted from their taxable incomes. I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment. The honorable member forCalare <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> has also suggested an amendment which I should like the Treasurer to accept. The honorable member proposes that any person who is carrying on agricultural or pastoral pursuits in a district which is subject to the ravages of animal pests shall be entitled to a deduction for the money he has spent in the purchase of wire netting used in the construction of a wire-netting fence to prevent animal pests from entering upon the land used by him in the production of his assessable income. Thousands of small farmers in Queensland find it absolutely necessary to surround their tomato plantations, banana plantations, or cotton crops with wire netting to protect them from wallabies, otherwise they would secure no crops, and no taxable income. The wire netting is purchased by them to enable them to earn an income. It will be a great boon to producers generally to assist the small farmer in this direction. I think that honorable members generally will support the increase in the general exemption from £200 to £300. The wage-earner is to-day only 7d. a week better off than he was in 1911. He certainly receives a higher remuneration for his services, but the increased cost of living has absorbed the whole of the increase in his wages with the exception of 7d. a week. Since 1911 the wage-earner has been chasing the high cost of living, and so far he has failed to improve his economic position. He has been denied full justice, industrially and economically, because his wage has always been just behind the increase in the cost of living. The great majority of the people of Australia, with families, whose earnings do not exceed £300 a year are just about on the bare subsistence line, or ares floundering on what is commonly called the bread line. They already pay, individually, the taxation imposed on the various trading companies, which pass it on. Commonwealth statistics relating to the cost of housing accommodation show the following increases from March. 1911, to the first quarter of March, 1924: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">That is one direction in which the workers have suffered from the increased cost of living. I shall quote other figures presently. Although the workers on the basic wage have had to contend with inadequacy of remuneration and unemployment, there are thousands of people in the community who profess amazement at the spirit of industrial unrest which they say is manifest among workers. But if they were compelled to endure some of the privations and hardships suffered by those whose salaries do not exceed £300 a year, and on  whom the burden of peopling this country rests, they would readily understand the cause of this unrest. Many people declare that the Australian workers are living in a veritable paradise, but, as a matter of fact, the workers themselves have good reason to be discontented with their lot. During the last twelve years the wealth owners of Australia have greatly improved their positions. Privately-owned capital has increased by approximately £1,000,000,000, whereas the average wage paid to the worker of the Commonwealth, after allowing for the increase in the cost of living, has not increased by more than 7d. a week. At a meeting of the Australian Science Congress, held in Adelaide on the 29 th August last, the Commonwealth Statistician disclosed the fact that privately-owned wealth in Australia at the end of 1921 aggregated £2,165,900,000 as against £1,417,910,000 in 1910-11. That increase was considerable enough, but calculating the increase in private wealth for the two years following 1921, on the basis of the preceding years, plus the natural increase in added wealth, we find that at the end of 1923 the private wealth of the Commonwealth was something over £2,400,000,000, approximately £1,000,000,000 more than in 1911. This huge increase in private wealth is made up in a variety of ways - cash, land, buildings, implements, machinery, live stock, metals, minerals, farming products, imported merchandise, manufactured products, raw materials, holdings in companies, and a score of other more or less tangible assets. Along with this increase in the riches of the wealth owners, there has been greater exploitation of the worker. From year to year the holdings of the wealthy have increased to a very much greater extent proportionately than have the wages of the workers. The latter have been forced to put up a desperate fight to maintain even the economic position they enjoyed in 1911. Prosperity has knocked at the door of manufacturers, and persons engaged in certain primary industries, but no- one can say that it has ever come to the door of the wage earner. He has been kept on the bare living wage, with intermittent periods of unemployment. The steadily mounting increase <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the cost of living has always deprived him of the advantage of the apparent increase in wages he has secured since 1911. The old-age pension is all that lies ahead of many of those who are to-day receiving less than £300 a year, and have large families to bring up and educate. It is absolutely impossible for them to set aside sufficient to keep themselves in their old age, especially where they have to meet excessive medical expenses. Fully 80 per cent, of the wealth of the Commonwealth is in the hands of about 30 per cent, of the population, while the other 70 per cent, is carrying on a desperate fight in order to make ends meet. Those who ask for a little more are branded as revolutionaries, bolsheviks, and anarchists. Is it to be wondered that sometimes a little bitterness is engendered in the fight of the workers for a better share of this world's goods 1 I remember the remark of a member of the British Empire Exhibition Commission, when that commission visited Mount Morgan. The commission saw the conditions under which the miners and the surface workers were toiling. The latter were then receiving the reduced wage of 13s. lOd. a day. One member of the commission said, " By Jove, I would not work here among these fumes for £2  a day." An increase in the income tax exemption to £300 is fully justified on the ground that many people who are earning from £200 to £300 a year cannot afford to pay income tax and meet the increased cost of living. The wealthy can afford to pay a substantial tax. The following figures show how private wealth in Australia has increased from 1911 : - </para>
                    <para class="block">The figures I have quoted show that the wealth-holders of the Commonwealth have improved their financial position at the rate of £2,400,000 a week. Let us see how the workers have fared  during the same period. If we study the facts and figures we find that their story is, indeed, a tragic one. The party to which I have the honour to belong does not only advocate better conditions for the workers in the mines or factories, or on the farms; it also advocates better conditions for all  who are engaged in the work of production, whether they be farmers or city workers. When we come to examine the figures for a period of years, we find how the cost of living has affected the average weekly wage paid to workers. </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="109331192409305_22_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">A study of these figures shows that in spite of the struggle of the workers throughout Australia to improve their remuneration their wages only increased by 841/2 per cent., while the cost of living increased by 82 per cent., and they are, therefore, only 7d. per week better off that in 1911. Prom 1911 to 1914 the nominal, wage of the workers increased by 81/2 per cent., but, owing to the increased cost of living, the purchasing power of 20s. in 1911 had dropped to 17s.11d. in 1914, so the worker was actually 3s. 6d. per week worse off in 1914 than in 1911. During those years private wealth increased by £178,770.,000. The war then occurred a war which, we were told, was to end war, and was to improve the conditions of the mass of the people and give them a new world, and in 1919, when the workers who went abroad to fight returned to Australia they found that although the average weekly wage had increased from 55s. 7d. to 74s.11d., the purchasing power of 20s., which had dropped to l7s.1d. in 1914, had declined to11s. 8d., making the purchasing power of the average wage 4s. 7d. a week less than in 1914. In the period from 1914 to 1919, during which the worker suffered this reduction in his purchasing power, the wealthy classes of Australia increased their wealth by £350.000,000. Since the termination of the war the capitalists have increased their wealth by £550,000,000. They have done remarkably well. In view of all these circumstances, the people receiving incomes of less than £300 per annum should have all the consideration that the Government can give them., and the proposal to increase the income taxation exemption from £200 to £300 should receive the hearty support of every honorable member. As the bill, so eloquently debated by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> contains some useful amendments, I intend to support it, but I hope that early next session the Government will introduce a consolidating measure to give effect to other desirable amendments indicated by the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>.- I, like the honorable member for Yarra, feel that the amendments proposed in this measure will be useful, but the bill does not remedy all the taxation anomalies and injustices from which our citizens are suffering. I feel that lengthy amendments to the measure would not, at this stage of the session, receive proper consideration, and, therefore, I do not intend to propose them; but I, too, hope that early next session we shall be given an opportunity to amend and to improve our taxation laws, so that justice may be done to the people. I also concur in the views enunciated by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> in regard to certain aspects of the bill. We ought to be very careful to see that we enact laws which will operate equitably upon all classes of the community. In 1922, when the consolidating taxation bill was before us, I endeavoured to amend the provisions of clause 13 with respect to the averaging system. I pointed out that some of the provisions of the measure appeared to me to be entirely unjust and unreasonable, and that it would do little to remove the injustices caused by our method of single-year taxation, but I was unable to persuade the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to accept my views. It should be laid down as a maxim that we must legislate justly for our citizens. The British Royal Commission on Taxation reported to the British Government in 1919 that no taxation law could be successfully administered which was contrary to the general sense of justice in the community. I agree with that. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> in addressing a meeting in Melbourne, on one occasion observed that he agreed with the maxims of Adam Smith, and he quoted the following : - </para>

                        <para class="block">Although every member of the House will approve of that, I regret that it has not been the result of the measure we passed in. 1922.. I. wish to draw the. attention: of honorable members to the actual experience- of one taxpayer under our. present system. His income, in round figures,, for- the year ended 30 th June, 1.921, was £5.,Q00; for tha- year ended-. 30th June, 1922.,. £6,000; and foi the year ended 30th June, 1923, £800, which waa. £11,800 for the three years,, an average of £3,933 a. year. A man with an irregular income which, averages £3,933 a year, should" not have to pay any more taxation than a man with a regular income, of that amount, for the taxable capacity of the two taxpayers would be the same. But what is the case under our existing legislation?' The man with the irregular- in come actually paid on his £1-1,800 a- total of £1,692', whereas the man with at regular income of ..the- same amount would: have- paid only £1,339', <inline font-style="italic">&amp;t</inline> £3'63; less1. A gross injustice like that simply howls for- remedy. Birt let  us  suppose for- at moment- that instead' of the- man. receiving his irregular income in the way mentioned, he received' it im the reverse order-; that is- to say, in the first year £800, in- the second £6;0O0&gt;, and' in the third' £5,000. It might just as easily have happened that' way, and1 had it been so his taxation, would have been £1,202 instead of £1,692', or £490; less than- he- actually paid. An act which would permit such a result is' clumsy, incomplete, and grossly unjust, for the taxpayer would "get at" the Government under its own- laws. The intention of this Parliament in agreeing to the graduated system was that the man with the- big income should pay more taxation! in the £1 than the man with the small income, but it was recognized when the consolidating bill was before us that .the1 system- would operate unjustly on the man who- had an irregular- income;, and there was a pretence on the part of the Government to. adopt an. averaging system'.. I submit that a. system! which could operate as this one does' is unfair. The-- lowest tax that should be. possible on an average" income of £3,933 a; year for three years, is. £1,339, and a  taxpayer  with am average income of £3,933  should  have to pay that amount. The- system that I suggested in as amendment I moved to the 19-22 bill would!  have  worked equitably, would have been, easier to. administer, than the present one, and' would not have impinged upon the graduated- system. <inline font-style="italic">J</inline> hope that an&gt;  opportunity  will be afforded to adopt the suggestion of the honorable: member  for  Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin'),</inline> for taxpayers; who have no- regular income are suffering <inline font-style="italic">voder</inline> a galling sense  of  injustice. Under the present law, the department goes from one extreme to the other, and injustice is  inflicted  either on. the- taxpayers or on- the country. A  five-years  averaging: system is' in operation, but, instead of averaging the income, an average rate of tax is determined. It is regrettable that the  innovation  was made. </para>

I believe that in a recent case the Commissioner refused to exempt a prospector because his title was not a lease but a licence. I do not wish a loop-hole to be left, so that it may be said that a prospector is engaged in the business of prospecting, and that his income is therefore taxable under the section providing for the taxation of profits derived from a business. The amendment, which contains nothing that might prove dangerous, is intended to help the ordinary prospector who is endeavouring to develop a property. He should not be taxed on the result of his arduous labours, from which, generally, he derives very little profit. He should not be taxed on the value of any shares given to him as a reward for his prospecting work. </para>

The present exemption includes sales by bona fide prospectors, whether by traffic, trade, or otherwise, arid also applies to the proceeds of the sale of a mining property when the Commissioner is satisfied that the lease has been sold by persons who do not make a business of buying or selling such properties, and who purchased the lease from a bona fide prospector, and work the property in a. proper and efficient manner.

                        <para>.- If the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> withdraws his amendment at this stage, he may not have another opportunity to move it. It is very difficult for us to discuss a bill which we have not seen.  I  have no doubt that the Treasurer believes that the bill which he proposes to introduce will provide the honorable member for Perth with an opportunity to move . his amendment, but when the bill comes before us we may find that it does not do so. That bill will, I take it, deal only with leases. I understand that it is a bill to tax, as income, the proceeds of the sales of leases other than mining leases. </para>

                            <para>. - This clause amends section 17 of the principal act, which deals with " walk-in walk-out " sales. Two years ago that section was amended to permit of the omission of breeding stock from a return. It was anticipated that it would apply to " walk-in walk-out " sales only, but in operation it has been found that certain pastoralists are able, under this clause, to carry on sales of their female stock in the ordinary course of business, and so practically to evade taxation. It makes section 17 apply wholly and solely to sales on a walk-in-walk-out basis. Ordinary income comes under section 16, which deals with what constitutes income, and section 23 deals with what constitutes deductions. </para>

Section 21 of the principal act is amended by omitting sub-section (2.) thereof, and inserting in its stead the following sub-sections: - (2.) The Commissioner shall assess the tax, and the additional tax, if any, which would have been payable by the shareholders if the sum or further sum determined by the Commissioner in accordance with sub-section (1.) of this section had been distributed to them in proportion to their interests in the paid-up capital of the company: </para>

(2a.) The company shall pay to the. Commissioner the amount of the tax and additional tax assessed under the last preceding sub-section.' " </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">The amendment carries out in simpler terms the intention of the original clause. It was thought that it would apply to a series of holding companies which might be formed simply for the purpose of evading taxation, but it did not completely fill the bill. Consequently, the clause has been amended to make it absolutely certain. The object aimed at by the amendment is the simplification of the method, by which the additional tax assessed under section 21 may be recovered, by action in the courts, if necessary, and by the collection through the company of income tax payable by individuals on any additional sum which the Commissioner considers the company could reasonably have distributed to its shareholders. Under the law as it stands, the Commissioner has no power to require the primary company to pay taxation on behalf of the person who is the real and final person holding an interest in the company. The clause in its amended form will give the Commissioner power to collect the additional taxation. The position has been completely changed from 1922. Under the alterations made last year companies were required to pay 1s. in the £1 instead of at the rate of 2s. 5d. on the undistributed profits. Though the Commissioner had power to assess the amount of profits which should have been distributed, he could not get any more taxation from the company. The clause has been drafted to enable the Commissioner to assess the shareholders, and . collect from the company the amount which would  have been due to the Crown if the profits had been properly distributed. Of course, it is desirable to get the closest approximation to equity that can be obtained. I am sure that all honorable members listened very attentively this afternoon to the honorable member for Yarra, but every one must realize the position we are now in. On the taxation system evolved in 1915, there has been built up a series of taxation measures and regulations, and we have a Public Service trained in those methods. We have passed the peak of taxation. Our highest year was 1921. Since then we have been gradually coming down. Eventually, we hope to completely evacuate the field of income taxation. It would obviously be very difficult, and would lead to endless work if we completely altered the system now. Though we may agree with the honorable member for Yarra that there could be a better system., we may differ with him as to the best system that could be devised, and the compromise might be worse than the present system. I do not think the present is an opportune time to completely revise the present system. The clause does not touch that principle. It is simply designed to prevent evasion of taxation by those who ought to pay it. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- The difficulty that honorable members are faced with in connexion with these amendments is that they were only circulated just before the dinner-hour adjournment. It is not fair to expect us to thoroughly understand their meaning. The amendment now before the committee appears at first sight to accomplish what the bill was intended to do, and I can at least say for it that it is couched in simpler language; but I am loth to say definitely that it accomplishes all that the original clause did. In that clause there was this very wide definition of " shareholders " - </para>

                    <para class="block">Thus the shareholder included a shareholder in any subsidiary company. We have not that definition in the bill now, but we do seem to achieve the same end in simpler language. Let us assume that the Government, by this clause, will accomplish what it sets out to achieve. I can still see the possibility of an evasion of the law. I agree with the Treasurer that the situation entirely changed when we departed from the taxation of companies at a rate which approximated the average rate of tax which the dividend receivers paid. Prior to last year, the company tax was 2s. 5d. in the £1 on undistributed profits. Before then it was 2s. 8d. We arrived at 2s. 5d. or 2s. 8d. in a rough and ready way as the average rate of income tax paid by the receivers of dividends. Last year, as I have already pointed out, the company rate was fixed at1s., and as a result there was a temptation to companies to get as much of their profits into reserves as possible, and to have as little as possible distributed in dividends. This is what the tax dodgers have been doing most effectively. The purpose of this amending legislation is to try to stop that practice. I do not want to dogmatize on this subject, but I suggest that even yet those who set themselves out to evade taxation may be able to do so. The amendment deals, only with undistributed profits. Under section 21, the Commissioner has power to deal only with a company that has not distributed at least two-thirds of its profits.Let us see what may happen even now. Let us assume that trading company " A " distributes two-thirds of its profits. The Commissioner cannot interfere. The company is taxed at1s. in the £1 on the whole of its profits. If the Commissioner determines to follow the two-thirds of profits distributed, he may find that they are held by a holding company "B." The profits of this holding company do not come under section 21. They must be treated as distributed dividends from company " A," and one-third can be reserved. In this way, the profits may be distributed in diminishing amounts. I cannot see how the amendment will meet the difficulty because it does not deal with profits that are not distributed. A company distributing two-thirds of its profits, which is the maximum which the Commissioner can compel it to distribute, does not have to comply with section 21 of the act. After the Commissioner has ascertained that two-thirds of the profits have been distributed it is found that the amount has been- passed on to an investing or holding company, and when the Commissioner attempts to apply section 21 to, say. ''' B " company, which is a holding company, he finds that as that company has already distributed two- thirds of its profits to another holding company, section 21 cannot apply. The Commissioner may also find on investigation that three, four,, or five other holding companies have each held one-third, and have distributed the remaining two-thirds. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a company formed for the purpose which, apart from the expenses of registration, does not incur any expenditure. It has been suggested during the debate that we should be able to define bogus- companies.. Purely bogus companies cam be detected and dealt with under special .legislation. But who is to be the judge of what is and what is not a bogus company? They secure their position by having a certain amount of legitimate holdings - if anything is legitimate, and I have very grave doubts about it - in  one  company or another. Some shipping companies hold large interests in. meat works and in coal mines, and I have in mind a company the bulk of whose capital is invested in a number of other companies. On what basis of equity can we allow companies to retain each year in reserve one-third of their profits so that within three years they get away with a full year'sprofit while paying the lower instead of the higher rate. In that way the Commissioner treats companies differently from, members of an individual firm who pay income taxation on the whole of their profits? Why should not the shareholders pay income taxation om the profits which come under the taxable amount? So long as this is not- done the department will be faced with difficulties. This provision will not meet the situation. When the Income Tax Rates Bill is before the House I intend to suggest an increase in the company's rate. If we inserted a penal clause we could to some extent improve the position, but I do not see how we can altogether avoid the existing anomaly under the present law. If an original trading company does- <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> distribute its profits it is- evading taxation.. When this measure is passed, and the Commissioner deems that two-thirds of the profits of a company have been distributed, the companies will adopt different methods. </para>

                            <para>- The holding company is the shareholder. How can the dividend be paid to an individual who does not hold the shares? If a shareholder in. a trading' company disposes of his interest to an investment or holding company, he  ceases  to be a shareholder in the trading company. If a person holding a controlling- interest in a trading, company disposes of his shares,, he receives in exchange shares' in an investment or .holding company. Under the existing la.w, when the Commissionerdeems* that two-thirds of the trading company's profits have been distributed, he can follow the profits to the holding companies, which pay ls. in the £1 on the undistributed! profits, less a rebate of ls. in the £1, which means- that they escape taxation. For the information of the Prime Minister :(Mr.'. Bruce), who was temporarily .absent, I 'shall repeat, that when a trading company distributes two-thirds of its profits, section 21 -of the act does not apply. The two-thirds of the profits .so distributed may .go to a holding company, and ;as the section I have mentioned does not apply, the Commissioner cannot interfere. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly it is taxation ,at the source, and that is why I do not like it. But under British legislation every shareholder receives a rebate after the dividend is distributed, whereas here a rebate is allowed .only to those who have a taxable income. Persons with a small income which is not taxable, and  who receive .a few pounds by way of dividends, pay 'at the rate .of ls. in the £1. </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">That is not done in Great Britain. Under British legislation the company pays 4s., and every shareholder who comes along with his dividend warrant, whether he is taxable or not, under the act receives a rebate; but we only give a rebate to those whose incomes are ' taxable. Persons at present receiving less than £200 do not receive any rebate, and when this measure is passed those whose income does not exceed £300 will not benefit. By raising the exemption from £200 to £300 we are assisting 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of the taxpayers, but are injuring many small shareholders in companies. Last year a similar measure was rushed through Parliament during an all-night sitting, when the closure was frequently applied, and the Government are now trying to patch it up in order to save revenue. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been lost, and we are now asked to pass retrospective legislation, which I always regard as vicious - although I do not so regard it in this case - to overcome the. mistakes of the past. I submit that this measure will not prevent tax dodgers evading taxation so long as they have the opportunity to contribute only ls. in the f i. There are three methods which can be considered. The British system is a simple one, which deems that all profits of a company are distributed, and they are followed up. The act amended last year under which 2s. 5d. in the £1 was imposed on undistributed profits, although inequitable, was preferable to the present act, and was better from the revenue point of view, because there was not the' same incentive to avoid taxation. When ls. in the £1 is imposed, companies are tempted to carry large sums into reserve, on which they pay a rate of ls. in the £1. Early next year, I hope the Treasurer will introduce another amending bill, to try to deal with the tax dodgers. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - The point which the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has taken deals with the whole basis of company taxation, as laid down in section 21. That section was designed to meet a certain type of case, but that which it was intended to obviate would happen under whatever system we might adopt. lt cannot be obviated by the system of taxation at the source, which we now have, or by providing that a company shall pay tax only upon the undistributed portion of its income, the remainder being followed into the hands of the individual shareholders, and taxed at the rate applicable to individual incomes. The honorable member stated that the English, system is quite different from our own. I dispute that statement. The English system is almost the same as ours, the only exception being that under the English act a rebate is allowed. In Great Britain the taxation is levied at the source in the same way that ours is levied. The English system has no great advantages over that of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they have had to follow our legislation by inserting in their act a provision similar to section 21 of the Commonwealth statute. That action was taken only twelve or eighteen months ago. Prior to that there was no provision by which it could be assumed that a company had made a bigger distribution than actually had 'been made. They had no provision of this kind. Those methods of avoiding taxation which the honorable member has suggested are possible here, by means of the creation of holding companies, could be adopted without any check at all in Great Britain, until  a  section similar to section 21 of our act was inserted in the British act. </para>

                            <para>- In ore-war days they could get away with very much less. The honorable member referred to the non-allowance of a rebate to a shareholder in Australia whose rate of tax is less than le. in the £1. That provision was inserted in our act in order to avoid complexity. I think that every honorable member will admit that the act is quite complex enough as it stands; but it would be still more complex if the alteration suggested by the honorable me'mber were made. Such a provision is not necessary when the tax is only ls. in the £1, but it is very necessary where, as in Great Britain, the tax is 4s. in the £1. It has been suggested that it is only the email taxpayer who pays this tax. He does nothing of the sort. The tax is paid by the company. It could be said that it was paid by the shareholder if the tax were sufficiently high to' affect the dividend, which, in other words, is the income that goes to the individual shareholder. But where the tax is only ls. in  the £1, it cannot have the slightest  effect  upon the dividend that the small shareholder receives. We should be adding still further to the complexity of an act that is already hopelessly complex if we inserted what the honorable member suggests. The section is principally intended to ensure that persons "who have  large  incomes from companies shall not evade their obligation to pay income tax by reason of the failure of companies to distribute a reasonable portion of their annual earnings. A very limited number of companies would resort to that- means of attempting to  evade  taxation. No ordinary public company, that has its shares on the market, would hold up the whole of its annual income and nOt distribute it amongst its shareholders. Tt must distribute a certain portion to its shareholders. </para>

                            <para>- That point is quite different from the one that we are now considering.  We are dealing now with .i company that retains its profits. A company that had a large number of shareholders could not do that. The shareholders would immediately demand the distribution of the income to which they were entitled. Such companies can, therefore, at once be dismissed from this consideration. Such a provision as that suggested by the honorable member for Yarra can contemplate only what are known as " one-man " companies - one man holding all the shares in a private company; but, in order to comply with the companies law, giving one share each to a few nominees. We have to endeavour to make it impossible for such companies to evade the taxation they are entitled to pay. This matter was very exhaustively reviewed when the consolidating act of 1922 was introduced. Prior to that time, we had a section of this character which provided that if the Income Tax Commissioner decided that a company had not distributed a reasonable portion of its profits, he had no option but to say that the whole of the profits must be deemed to have been distributed. If, for instance, a company had distributed 30 per cent, of its profits, and the Commissioner decided that that was not a reasonable distribution, but that 50 per cent, would have been, he had no power, prior to 1922, to levy tax on the basis of a distribution of 50 per cent. He had to levy tax upon the whole of the profits. Either he had to refrain from declaring that a sufficient portion of the profits had not been distributed, because, by doing so, he would be compelled to commit an act of gross inequity by imposing taxation on the whole of the profits, or he had to so act that it would be impossible for a company to retain a reasonable amount for reserves and for the future expansion of its business. The unsatisfactory nature of the position was appreciated when the consolidating act was introduced in 1922. The matter was examined from every angle, and it was decided that the Commissioner should not have the power to pursue the matter further if a company had distributed two-thirds of its profits. He had to see that the company had made a reasonable distribution. It is perfectly true that, in some cases, it might not be a reasonable distribution, but there are very few companies in respect of which it could be said that a distribution of two-thirds of its profits was not reasonable. An ordinary company ought to retain one-third of its profits to build up its reserves and ensure its stability. It can be regarded as reasonable, therefore, if two-thirds of the profits have been distributed and one-third is retained for a reserve to meet the future requirements of the business. It is suggested that that is not altogether satisfactory because of the existence of these one-man companies. It must be remembered, however, that there are not a great number of those companies. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable members examine the returns, they will find that there are not many persons who can afford to leave the greater part of their "profits in any company, even if it will relieve them from a certain amount of income  tax. They may save 'a little in i that direction, font they are .under the disadvantage that .the .money <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> locked up is not available for their .current expenses. It is further .argued that a company can invest its profits in other companies, and. Whereby avoid the payment of taxation, lt must be remembered, however,, that each of those .other companies must observe the two-thirds standard. Quite apart from the complexity involved in .registering one company after another, there is the further disadvantage that the income always is a diminishing one, and the difficulties are- augmented toy every transaction. Nobody can carry out  a  series of transactions of that sort. Money so invested is withdrawn from current income, and is not available for ordinary purposes, lt must also be remembered that that money cannot he handled until the .company is wound up. I had a good deal to do -with this matter when the consolidating act  was introduced, and I believe that a reasonable 'basis has been adopted. It would be quite unreasonable to assume that the whole of the profits had been distributed. 'The harm to the community would he greater than the advantage gained from catching a few persons who were endeavouring to avoid their taxation obligations. In a country such as Australia, our one aim should be to build up industdi.es and to encourage those who are controlling industry through the agency of a joint-stock company not to distribute too great a part of their profits, but, on the contrary, to retain as much as possible for the expansion and stabilization of their .business. </para>

                            <para>- It does. The honorable member infers that the .treatment of the individual is different from that of the company. It has been suggested that they should be dealt with on the same basis. I point out to the honorable member that it is open to any person to turn his business into a private company if he thinks that it is advantageous to do so. There are no better means for employing capital developmentally than are offered under the joint-stock system, which is universally adopted, and under which are drawn together the small contributions of many persons, the aggregate sum being utilized in carrying on a great industry. The point raised by the honorable member for Swam {.Mr. .Gregory) was fully considered in 1922, and :a new provision was inserted in the act .dealing with partnerships and private individuals. </para>

                            <para>- I stress the point that that system does not confer any advantage upon the majority of the people of this country. Only a few individuals can afford to do it. Nothing is gained by creating a holding company and putting into it the  dividends you obtain from some " other company, if you cannot get them out of the second company for your ordinary purposes year by year without paying taxation. Once you invest in " B " company a dividend obtained .from " A " company you cannot get at that income until " B" company declares a dividend. That dividend immediately becomes taxable. The transaction is not nearly so simple as it sounds. It would be impossible to devise an absolutely perfect system without making it so complex that it could not be administered. The honorable member for Yarra said that our objective should be to bring about equity and simplicity. It is extraordinarily difficult to reconcile one with the other. The more equitable you -are the more complex you become. The less complex you are the less equitable you become. It is the duty of the legislature to prevent evasion of taxation as far as possible. Section 21, which gives the Commissioner the right to insist upon a further distribution of profits if a company has not distributed at least two-thirds of its profits, provides a reasonable basis. It ensures that every company must make a fair distribution, but it does not penalize a company that is endeavouring to build up its business and make adequate reserves. It, at all events, limits the opportunity to avoid the payment of taxation., because .a person who forms a  company with that object cannot have the taxation withheld on a greater amount than one-third1 of the. profits that are earned, lt <inline font-style="italic">is,</inline> I think, obvious that an amendment of the' act. is necessary. Means have been discovered for getting over what  was  the intention, of the legislature, la the first place, a tax is imposed upon, a company which has not distributed a sufficient, amount of its profits. </para>

He is given a discretion to decide whether a company has not distributed two-thirds of its profits. If it has not, he can compel it to make a further distribution. Under the consolidating act the company has to pay the tax, which would have been payable by the taxpayer if a distribution' had been made. Prior to the passing of the consolidating act, it was the shareholder who had to pay, although no distribution of dividends had been made- to him, and he had no moneys from the company from which to meet the tax. To secure greater justice, it is provided that the company shall pay, and the basis upon which the company pays is the rate which would have been applicable to the shareholder if, in fact, he had enjoyed a dividend. </para>

                            <para>- He tries to pay the one tax now and we are endeavouring to prevent, him from doing that. If he leaves what might be his; dividend in the company of which he is the one shareholder, he pays, at the company rate,, instead of at the rate applicable to an income of £50,000. a year. The Taxation Commissioner may then, say that there should have been a distribution* of a greater amount of the earnings of the company, and he may decide that the. distribution should be £10,000., The company would then have to pay on £10,000/ at the 6s., 7s., or 8s. rate applicable to the income of the shareholder instead of at the ls. rate. This does not suit the enterprising gentleman who is the sole shareholder of a company, and he proceeds to register a small holding company or syndicate, and give his shares to that syndicate. Then the Taxation Commissioner says, to the "A" company, "You have not distributed enough. You must, distribute so much more." The; amount to be distributed might be £10,000', and the Commissioner would look to see who was the shareholder who would get the £10,000. He would find that it was another company, and so would only pay at the ls. rate. In order to defeat that, tins amendment lays, it down that where a distribution should have been, made by "A1* company and the shareholder- is "B" company, the Taxation Commissioner takes no notice of "B" company in order to ascertain the rate of tax,, but finds out the rate which would have been- payable by shareholders, in- <inline font-style="italic">'Iff'</inline> company according, to their interest in "B" company, which gives, again the rate at which the big man- should pay. The practice to which I referred is being met by one amendment of the law provided for in this bill. Another amendment is proposed to- meet the case where, instead of forming a holding company, shares are paid into the hands of a trustee, and the trustee is a shareholder in the company. In this case, where a distribution has been ordered' by <inline font-style="italic">'"A"</inline> company, the Commissioner looks around1 for the shareholder and he finds that he is a trustee. He ascertains -what rate the trustee should pay, and he find's that he has no financial interest in the shares  aifc,  all, and therefore could nob be called upon to pay tax: at any rate. To get over that difficulty, it is proposed to go beyond the trustee to the beneficiary, and charge tax at the rate applicable to the beneficiary. I think that honorable members will agree that these amendments are desirable and necessary. Coming back to the point raised by the honorable member for Yarra, I say, emphatically, that it is quite impossible <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> do what he desires and provide that, in no conceivable circumstances, can anybody avoid paying tax at the rate applicable to his income. We could not do that, even if we adopted the system he has suggested of following the dividend into the hands of the shareholders and taxing them at their individual rate. That would be going back to the system we had before, under which a company only paid the tax on undistributed income. I venture to say that the honorable member for Yarra was quite wrong in suggesting that the British system is better than our own, because the British system follows exactly the plan we have of taxing at the source. Under the British system, there is no better means than we have here of meeting cases such as we have been discussing to-night. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member contrasted the company rate of 4s. in the £1 in Great Britain, as against the rate of ls. in the £1 in Australia; but the difference is not so great as might be supposed. I remind the committee that the 4s. rate was imposed in Britain only because of the war, and the pressure to which Britain was subjected during the war. Prior to the war, the British income tax was a negligible quantity. Another fact which must be remembered is that in Australia the system generally adopted by the states is to tax at the source. In New South Wales, for example, the tax which has to be paid by a company to the state is 2s. 6d. in the £1, in addition to the ls. in the £1 payable to the Commonwealth. So that, whilst a company carrying on business in Great Britain would pay tax at the rate of 4s. in the £1, a company carrying on business in New South Wales would pay at the rate of 3s. 6d. in the £1, and the difference is not very great. The question whether we should tax at the source, or should tax only undistributed profits and tax dividends in the hands of shareholders, has been very exhaustively discussed in this House on many occasions. It was discussed from every aspect when we were considering the consolidating bill in 1922, and it was again the subject of consideration last year. I submit that the system we now propose will work quite satisfactorily. It embodies the principle of simplicity so absent from many provisions of the existing act, and it offers no greater opportunity for those determined to evade taxation than is offered by the other system to which reference has been made during the debate. </para>

                        <para>.- I venture to doubt whether the amendment proposed by the Treasurer will' secure the object he has in view. In the first place, there will be difficulty in following moneys along the track which has been referred to by various speakers. Apart from this, an easy method has suggested itself to me -of evading liability to taxation under this section. To give honorable members an example, I suggest that " A " is a company, which the Commissioner determines should make a larger distribution of its income. Suppose that income is earmarked, and it is possible to follow it down through "B," " C," and " D " companies. If I am a shareholder of " D " company, and only a shareholder of that company, and get part of the distribution, then the proviso applies to me, and tax must be paid, because the words of the section are - </para>

                    <para class="block">This applies, it will be seen, only to a case where the shareholder of " D " company is not a shareholder of " A " company. If I were a shareholder of "D" company, and wished to enable "A" company to evade the application of the section, I should make myself a shareholder also of "A" company. I would then no longer be a " person who is not a shareholder of' A ' company." As in that case the distribution would not be to a person who is not a shareholder of "A" company, but to a shareholder of " D " company, who is also a shareholder of "A" company, the section would not apply. From a cursory examination of the amendment, this device suggests itself to me as a means by which the payment of the tax might be evaded. I suggest to the Treasurer that if the amendment were altered to read, " Provided that, where any person (other than a company, trustee or partnership) otherwise than as a shareholder of the company would .... have received. . . .

                        <para>. - I should not have spoken again on this amendment but for the remarks of the Prune Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who did not deal with the issues raised in this debate. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has directed attention to one loophole, and has probably provided a patch for it, but it is significant that even the honorable member, with his legal mind, is unable to show how the larger breach that I discovered can be patched. Nor did the Prime Minister do so. Let me consider the remarks of the Prime Minister, and show whether he gave the committee the facts. He said that nothing could be done under this bill that could not be done under the British act. What I have been stressing is that there is not the incentive to do it under the British act that there is under our act. In England a company cannot escape with anything less than the company tax, which, on the latest figures I had, was 6s., but which the Prime Minister stated was 4s. The real reason why the provision is so dangerous is that the company tax in Australia is too low. To say that an English company could do under the British act what an Australian company could do under the Australian act is to beg the question. If a British company did dodge the tax. by transferring all its profits to reserve, it would still have to pay the company rate, which is four times the Australian company rate. The Prime Minister advanced a most extraordinary argument in reply to my remarks about small shareholders paying1s. in the £1. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">He said that the act would be made much more complex if these people were given a rebate. There would be very little complexity in it'. Under the English system a notification is attached to the dividend warrant saying that " This dividend has paid a tax of so much in the £1, which will be refunded on the presentation of proof that you have received this." That document is handed in, and the person receives the rebate. The system adds very little complexity to the work of assessment. I submit that persons who are not taxable are as much entitled to rebates as those that are taxable. Those that are taxed 5d. in the £ ought to get the same rebate as those that are taxed 5s. in the £1, but they do not get it under our inequitable system. The act lets off the wealthy man who has shares in a company, but hits the small man hard. The Prime Minister said that  the payment of the tax by companies would not have the slightest effect on the shareholders' dividends. If the small shareholder is not entitled to a rebate, then his fellow-shareholders are not entitled to it, but they get it, because they are big men. The small man does not get it, but the big man does. The arguments or excuses that are put forward to deprive the small man of the rebate can be advanced with the same amount of logic, if there is any logic in it, to prevent the big men from getting a rebate. The Prime Minister said that public companies whose shares were on the market could not do this sort of thing, but would have to distribute their profits, because their shareholders would want dividends. I admit that, but we are not discussing such public companies, whose shares are quoted on the market, but companies whose shares are held by a few individuals. The daily newspapers every day contain notices of half a dozen registrations, the object of which is to evade income taxation and land taxation. That sort of thing has been done to the knowledge of the Government for a considerable time. This class of company, said the Prime Minister, is limited in number. I answer that argument by saying that such companies are 'springing up like mush-' rooms, and are not limited in number. He went on to say that there was a lot of complexity in forming and registering these companies. There is no complexity in it. If he will refer to the notices of registration last week, he will see that one family in the State of Victoria registered seven companies, with the same directors in each of them. The total amount of capital was £90,000. Why did they break the business up into seven companies? In my opinion the answer is obvious. In reply to an interjection by the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes),</inline> he said: " If these individual arms wish to do it, they can form themselves into companies." A moment before he had said that it was difficult and complex to form and register companies. If you are a big firm you can form yourself into a company, and the inducement is to do it, for by that means you can pass' a large part of the burden of taxation on to the " other fellow who cannot, or is too honorable, to form a company. The speech of the Prime Minister was an example of special pleading. He said that the provision relating to the distribution of two-thirds of the profits was reasonable. It may be reasonable for a new company, but it may be very unreasonable for an old-established company. The reasonableness of it depends on the position of the company. But I submit that the distribution is no more reasonable for a company than for a firm. If it is reasonable tor a company to be allowed to place one-third of its profits to reserves and pay only ls. in the £1 tax on them, it is equally reasonable for a firm to do so. This provision means that a company need pay only ls. in the £1, instead of the shareholders paying perhaps 5s. in the £1, on one year's income in every three years. The Prime Minister said that companies could not all afford to keep profits in reserve, because t-hey wanted them, and that the provision applied to only a limited class of companies. Surely that is an argument on my side. It is because the provision applies to a small and privileged class that I object so strongly to it. I could understand him saying that because the provision applies to all taxpayers it is equitable. The truth is that it applies to a limited few, and those the wealthy few, who can afford to put their money in reserve, and not distribute it. The Prime Minister also said, " What is the use of these reserves being paid into a holding company if you cannot get them out? The moment the holding company pays out the money in dividends, the Government taxes it." That kind of argument might deceive some people, but it will not deceive honorable members, be- cause it is well known to them that there are well-to-do firms the proprietors of which do not want to spend more than a fraction of their profits. If they received the profits in cash they would convert them into bonds at 6} per cent., to pile up more profits. The holding company could do that out of profits that have paid ls. in the £1, but which, if distributed as dividends, would have paid perhaps 5s. or 6s. in the £1. </para>

                            <para>- I am not asking that any company should be forced to pay anything in dividends, but I say that a company, for the purpose of ascertaining its taxable income, should be treated as if it was a private firm. It is impossible for honorable members to escape from the logic or justice of that argument. In my previous remarks I stated that the rate of tax imposed upon companies in Great Britain was 6s. in the £1. I have since ascertained that it was 6s. in the £1 until an amendment was made this year, when it was reduced to 4s. 6d. It is now 4s. 6d., and not 4s., as stated by the Prime Minister. The purpose of the bill is to protect the revenue of this country. The Prime Minister argued that it would protect the revenue from the operations of the manipulators that had been forming holding companies . As  far as I have been able to read the bill in the limited time allowed to honorable members, it does so as far as section 21 of the principal act is concerned. That is to say, it will prevent the formation of holding companies to cheat the ' revenue out of the taxation on the undistributed profits of a company. When I pointed out to the Prime Minister that the revenue could  be cheated in another way, he admitted that that was so. The Commonwealth is losing revenue through the operations of manipulators and tax-dodgers, who form bogus companies in order to get the benefit of the ls. rate instead of the higher rate applicable to individuals, and I am showing that even if the proposal contained in this clause is accepted, they will still be able to evade taxation; they will not hold their profits, but each company in turn will distribute two-thirds of them, and then section 21 will not apply. If one family has formed seven companies, other families may do likewise. So long as the company rate is ls. iu the <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> and the rates applicable to individuals are as -high as 7s. in the £1, so long will means of evading the higher rate be found. The existing provision is more equitable and less easy of evasion. I admit that under any scheme we may adopt companies will still be formed which will put a certain amount of their profit into a reserve, fund; but if the amounts carried to reserve are taxed at the rate of 2s. or 3s. in the <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> the Commonwealth will not be- cheated to the same extent as it is at present. I suggest that the Treasurer should reconsider this matter, so that when the bill declaring the rate of taxation is before us, an amendment may be made to tax profits carried to reserve at the same rate as the individual shareholders would pay if such amounts were distributed. </para>

                        <para>. - It is very much to be regretted that the amendments contained in the bill are brought forward in such a way as to make it difficult to understand what their effect will be upon the principal act, to say nothing of their effect upon the taxpayer. Like the Prime Minister, I deplore the complexity of this measure, and of the taxation system generally, but I was rather appalled <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> hear him say that it was impossible to get equity with simplicity. I suppose that from that remark we are to deduce that justice, like the peace of God, " passeth all understanding." I hope that is not so. The bill consists of fifteen clauses, which propose about 50 or 60 amendments to the act'. The Prime Minister has said that he is quite sure that these proposals are all right. I remember having heard a similar remark in previous years. Probably there was a time when I almost believed these assurances by the right honorable gentleman, but times' have changed, and I cannot now accept them unreservedly. The proposal to which the honorable member for Yarra has' directed attention is most difficult. Whatever we do, we shall probably wish that we had done something else. The outstanding defect of the amendment is the tremendous power to be given to the Commissioner. For all practical purposes, the Commissioner will impose the taxation, but, unlike a god, he is not given dominion over the whole earth, or even this community; he cannot temper the wind to the shorn shareholder, but he may temper it <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a company. I understand from the Prime Minister thai the delinquents are few, and the righteous many, and so in practice the Commissioner has to deal with very few people who deliberately evade taxation. But human nature being what it is, I imagine that every company will se arrange its affairs and statements as <inline font-style="italic">te</inline> pay as little taxation as possible. That. I assume, is what all ordinary human beings, do. Companies are of two classes. In one class of company there are large numbers of small investors, of whom we hear a good deal in another connexion. They form, as it were, the outer bulwark when the big companies are in danger, and, at such times, we are abjured to have regard for the small investors. But this bill does nothing for them ; they have to pay on the higher rate.- The other class are the one-man companies, which are not so rare as the Prime Minister professes to believe. The formation of such companies occurs as frequently as is profitable, and if this bill makes the subterfuge more profitable, there will be many more such companies. They are formed for the purpose of evading the tax or taking advantage of the act. The right honorable gentleman if in a cleft stick. If he imposes excessive taxation so that no money will be available for the expansion of business, it will be a fatal check to progress. The amendment, we are told, will allow for the expansion of industry, while at the same time assuring to the Taxation Department a fair return. This method, however, does not appeal to me as likely to be more satisfactory than the present system or thai which obtained in 1922. The one-man company is no more entitled to consideration than is the private individual. In fact, such a company was a- private individual before this method of taxation made it profitable for him to become a company. He should continue to be regarded as an individual, as in fact he is. If we are to give as much latitude to the Commissioner as is proposed, it would be better to give him power to say what is a bona fide company, as distinguished from a company formed for tha evasion of taxation, rather than invest him with authority to require one taxpayer to pay a much higher rate than another. I can make no suggestions for improving the bill. I have at various times made a good many suggestions in connexion with measures of this kind, and I have come to the conclusion that .as fast as we block up one hole another appears elsewhere I look forward with a certain degree of chastened expectation to hearing once more about this time next year another bill- introduced, and being told once more that at last the department has evolved an equitable and effective scheme of taxation. I suppose it is futile to suggest that it would be well to leave the law as it is at present, so that we may have an opportunity during the recess to look carefully through the bill, and discuss with those who are affected by it what its consequences are likely to be. We could then return to the consideration of the measure with our minds refreshed and enlightened. I certainly think that it would be better to postpone the bill. I do not wish to vote against this clause, but judging it by and large, I am not in favour of the bill. </para>

I do not understand the bill, altered as it is by the long list of further amendments. Like most honor able members, I depend upon specialists for information regarding the effects of the taxation system and proposed amendments thereto. Having regard to what I have been able to glean from this discussion to-night, and conversation with those who have made a study of this matter, I am not satisfied with the proposed amendments relating to the taxation of companies. Would it not be possible to . make it incumbent on any company receiving income in the shape of dividends from another company to pay duty on that income on the basis on which an individual pays <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- If a person forms a company and holds 99 per cent, of the shaves and makes a profit of £60,000, he may subsequently form an investment company whose income is probably the greater proportion of £60,000. No taxation would be payable upon that £60,000, other than on the income derived from its investment, whereas, if an individual received the same amount he would be called upon to pay taxation upon it at the highest rate. I cannot understand this keen desire to protect the company as against the individual. I agree with the Prime Minister that it is an advantage to have joint stock companies formed in Australia, but I think that the income they receive from the shares held by them in other companies should be subject to the same rate of taxation as is paid by individuals. No person should be allowed to escape his fair share of taxation by the formation of a bogus company, or even by promoting a legitimate company to build up a huge concern "which may ultimately bring him a large profit. </para>

As fashioned last  year, the act operates more favorably to the small man than it does to the big man. If a person has an income of £400. of which £200 is derived from personal exertion, and £200 from dividends, the taxation of the £200 at the source automatically puts him completely outside the scale of taxation on his income from personal exertion. A man with an income of £400 from personal exertion and £400 from dividends, is simply taxed at. the rate of £400. </para>

                            <para>- The man with the larger income pays a higher rate than 1s., because the dividend he receives is used, together with his personal exertion income, to determine the rate of his tax. The smaller man frequently gets clean out of the taxable field, by reason of the fact that the dividends he receives are not taken into account at all. The second question raised by the honorable member was the continual formation of companies. But the honorable member forgets that in every state, except Victoria, the taxation on companies is very severe. In New South Wales, the rate is 2s. 6d. in the £1, and I believe it is 3s. 9d. in the £1 in Queensland, which rates, with the1s. added by the Commonwealth, ' make a fairly formidable impost on the formation of companies. The honorable member also forgets that the existing act makes provision for the individual conducting a business. Section 30 provides - "(1.) Where an individual derives income from a business carried on by himself or in partnership with other persons, and his rate of tax on that income exceeds 2s. 5d. in the £1, he shall be entitled to a rebate in his assessment of a sum equal to the amount by which his tax on fifteen per centum of that income exceeds the tax that would be payable at 2s. 5d. in the £1 on that percentage of that income. (2.) In this section "business" means a business, which, from its nature and character requires for its efficient working the retention in the business of some part of the income of each year. </para>

                    <para>The individual therefore has a certain amount of consideration extended to him as against the company, although I admit the 15 per cent, he may keep in hand is not as great as the 30 per cent, which the company may keep in reserve. According to the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes),</inline> this bill is not receiving the consideration it should get, and no attempt has been made to acquaint honorable members with what the actual amendments are. This is not so, for a memorandum , has been circulated showing honorable members at a glance how the amendments affect the original act. Furthermore, the second reading was moved five days ago, and all the information available has been in the hands of honorable members since then. There may be some occasion to dispute the general principle underlying the bill, hut as I have previously said, income taxation by the Commonwealth is not to-day as burning a question as it was a few years ago. I admit that its basis may be unsound, but that basis was deliberately adopted by a previous Parliament. Any proposal to alter it now reminds me of what occurred in the case of an operation I performed some years ago. The patient had a tumour on his shoulder which necessitated the removal of the whole of his forequarter. When the operation was completed, the doctor who was administering the anaesthetic asked, "Which part of him shall we put to bed " ? If we try to deal with the principle underlying this legislation, I am afraid that when we complete our task, it will be impossible to say what portion of it ought to be left, or what portion ought to be thrown away. The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> in paragraph 2 of the amendment, is a good one.

                    <para class="block">The clause proposes to amend section 23 of the principal act relating to deductions by altering sub-section 1, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> in order to provide that where a taxpayer claims an exemption for rates and taxes paid by him, they must be rates and taxes for which he is personally liable, and not taxes paid by him on behalf of others. Another amendment in the same paragraph adds the words " or any war-time profit tax." A deduction of war-time profits tax paid is allowable in the assessment of the year in which the payment was made. But an adjustment may have been made in the assessment of the wartime profits tax by reducing that tax to the extent of the actual tax charged, and it is therefore necessary to make this amendment, so that it is absolutely clear that no double deduction can be claimed in respect of war-time profits tax already paid. The remainder of the clause deals with deductions that may be made in respect of the depreciation of machinery and plant. It provides for a much bigger concession than hitherto. It first of all re-states the existing law and provides for an alternative basis of deduction and for the taxpayer adhering to his choice in all future assessments. Persistent claims have been made over a number of years for some provision to meet the cost of replacing obsolete machinery, and the Government believes that the enactment of the clause will lead to the replacement of obsolete machinery with more modern plant, particularly in such establishments as butter factories. The amendment to the clause as printed is necessary owing to the fact that as the clause stands it requires a taxpayer to treat as income the whole of any amount for which he may sell an asset in respect of which he has. previously obtained deductions under the heading of depreciation. The amendment will limit the taxpayer's liability in this respect. The reason for the limitation is that it follows the main important principle of the Income Tax Assessment Act, namely, that any profit on the disposal of a fixed capital asset is not subject to tax. The amendment will, of course, require the taxpayer to write back to taxable income all the previous deductions he has received as depreciation in any case in which his sale price for the asset exceeds its original cost price. If the sale price is less than the original cost but is greater than the value of the asset as written down by the previous depreciation deductions, the difference between the sale price and the written down value as mentioned is to be written back to income in the year of the sale of the asset. </para>

                        <para>.-While I have a great deal of sympathy with the men on the land who are obliged to fight pests, I ask where this kind" of exemption is to end. I do not see any difference between allowing the exemption of expenditure on wire netting and in allowing the exemption of expenses incurred in the eradication of weeds or the destruction of rabbits. The man who goes into the heart of the Gippsland forest, and clears a block to carry on farming operations, might also be granted an exemption if this principle is to be adopted. </para>

If the exemption he has proposed were limited to struggling settlers, I should not raise my voice against it, but doubtless it will bc claimed by wealthy taxpayers who have many miles of wire netting on their runs, which add to the capital value of their properties.

I venture to say that the loss of revenue represented by the proposed exemption will be more than made up by the increase in income tax and land tax due to the increased carrying capacity of the land resulting from the use of netting. </para>

                        <para>.- The money spent on wire netting is a very desirable capital expenditure, but, as the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has pointed out, this is a proposal to deduct expenditure of a capital nature from income. This is a matter of policy, and the Treasurer has given the reason why he is prepared to accept the amendment. However, I fail to see why a distinction should be made between a taxpayer who has entered into an undertaking with a government or a state authority for the purchase of wire netting, and a person who- prefers to procure it from a private source, for the advantage accruing from the erection of the netting is the same in each case. </para>

                        <para>.- While I recognize that the amendment will have a beneficial effect, there is much to be said in favour of the argument of  the honorable member for Yarra. The amendment certainly embodies a departure from the principle laid down in the act of distinguishing between capital expenditure and expenditure from revenue, but as a great many settlers will be benefited I have no doubt that the end justifies the means. The erection of wire netting increases the producing capacity of the land, and I therefore support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>-.- In no period of Australia's history have the farmers and pastoralists been better able to pay income tax on money -spent on wire netting than they are at the present time. This Parliament has already granted bounties on dried fruit, grapes and butter, and it will soon be known as the Parliament that, has given away the most public money to people who do not need it. Its actions in this direction are a source of amusement among passengers on the trains between Melbourne arid Sydney, and even honorable members supporting the Government are beginning to realize the seriousness of the situation. I have never heard of any strong demand for the assistance proposed tinder the amendment. I have endeavoured to ascertain the number of absentee land-owners who are making fortunes out of the properties held by them in Australia. There are other ways in which the Government can ease the burden of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- As Australia has to meet heavy expenditure in connexion with war loans and interest, the Commonwealth should not deprive itself of the right to collect income tax. Last year our indebtedness was reduced by about £9,000,000, but at the same time we loaded it to the extent of about £20,000,000. There is no necessity for these exemptions. The people who will be affected have not asked for them. If it were but a few months before the next election I could understand the action of the Treasurer and members of the Country party in making these concessions. Because of the measures which it has introduced - measures dealing with butter, dried fruits, and other primary products - the Government is the laughingstock of its own friends. The committee would be well advised to reject this amendment). </para>

No deduction is more justified than ' the medical, funeral or hospital expenses incurred for a man, his wife, or the members of his family.

                        <para>.- I should like to know whether the deductions to which we are now agreeing will apply to incomes derived during the year ended the 30th June last. I make this inquiry because returns showing the income for that year are due to-day in South Australia. If the deductions for wire netting, and medical and funeral expenses are to be allowed for that year, what is the position of South Australian taxpayers ? I wish also to know whether the exemption of ?300 is to apply to the present or past financial year ? </para>

                        <para>. - The intention is to apply this bill to the present financial year, and for that reason the Government is trying to push it through the committee. When the honorable member for North Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes)</inline> was speak- , ing he suggested delaying the bill until the end of the year, but if that were done no benefit would be derived in the assessments and returns for this year, and considerable delay would be occasioned in assessing the income tax. If the bill is carried a public notification will be made, and taxpayers will be asked to send in full details. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause is inserted in the bill because the spirit and principle of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not to tax capital. The clause exempts from taxation any lease from the Commonwealth or a state being a perpetual lease without re-valuation, or a lease with a right of purchase. In future such leases will be regarded as practically freehold. This matter will be dealt with at greater length in a later bill dealing with leaseholds. </para>

                        <para>.- I think 30 days is a fair period for payment. Money is worth something to a Government operating on a proper business footing. The loss of interest during the extra period of 30 days would be about £50,000 a year. Private firms are prepared to give a trade discount for payment within seven days, and a smaller trade discount for payment within 30 days, but no consideration at all after that period. I know that the Government does not give any discount. It is paying 61/2 per cent, for loans, and therefore this money should not be allowed to remain outstanding for 60 days. On the 31st June last there were uncollected over £5,000,000 in federal income tax and land tax, and if the period of payment is extended to 60 days the loss in interest will be much greater. I am opposed to the clause. </para>

                        <para>.- The clause does not go far enough. One of the great . objections to income tax is the fact that the whole of the tax is levied at one time, which is very often an awkward time, leading to the dislocation of a man's domestic finance. One reason for the heavy indirect taxation is that under it the people do not know what they are paying. The direct taxation is much lighter, but the limited period of payment makes it unpopular. It would be far better if the payment for income tax were spread over four quarters of the year. </para>

                        <para>.- I am also opposed to the clause. I should like to know what is the position of certain people in South Australia who have not yet received their assessment for 1923. I understand that hundreds of assessments have not yet been issued. The Treasurer had a good deal to say about the economy that would be effected by the amalgamation of state and federal departments, but I am wondering what is going to happen to the South Australian taxpayers I have mentioned. Are we to assume that when they get their assessments, say, in January, 1925, they will have another 60 days within which to pay taxation that ought to have been paid within six months of June, 1923 ? </para>

                        <para>- As every honorable member is aware, there has been very widespread discussion on this important question, which must seriously affect trade between the Motherland and Australia. It is bound to have a very important effect upon Imperial trade relationships. In fact, I consider it one of the gravest questions that could engage the attention of this House. The trade preference agreement between Canada and Australia was thought to be of sufficient importance to justify the Minister in submitting a series of resolutions to this House. Although only one item was mentioned in the statement made to-day, I am inclined to think that in its operation it will have a more widespread effect upon British trade than all the proposals contained in the treaty with Canada, but owing to the form in which it was submitted, the House will have no opportunity to discuss it. I view with considerable alarm the effect of this proposal upon our trade. From what the Minister said to-day, I believe that very many features of it have not been fully considered, and they certainly have not been fully explained to honorable members. I regret that I am forced to take advantage of this opportunity to protest against the manner in which the business has been dealt with. I am perfectly well aware of course, that there is one way in which the House may express disapproval of what has been done. The regulation has not yet been passed. Presumably it will be passed within the next week or two, either just before or just after Parliament adjourns. The treaty will come into force on 1st April next, and Parliament will probably not be meeting again until about that time. The only way in which the House may alter the arrangement is by a definite motion, that the regulation be disallowed. That must be done within fifteen days after the gazettal of such regulation or, if Parliament be in recess, within fifteen days after it reassembles. Action then will probably be ineffective, for the simple reason that the regulation will have been in operation, and the necessary trade adjustments will have been made. Such an important matter involving our Imperial trade relationships should not be dealt with so lightly. A resolution by Cabinet should not go forth to the world as the studied and deliberate opinion of this House. </para>

                <para class="block">It may bo the opinion of the majority of honorable members that this action should he taken, but personally I do not think it is. It may be that the basis of preference should be altered, but I feel strongly that it should not be. At any rate, an opportunity should be given to the minority, however small, to express its disapproval, so that it cannot be represented to Great Britain that the people of Australia as a whole are in favour of taking this step, which, in my opinion, will prove to be one of the greatest hindrances to the future development of trade. It is a direct denial of the principle of preference to Great Britain, because it is increasing the obstacles in the way of trade with Great Britain. Whatever may be said to the contrary by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the effect that it is intended to stop foreign trade, it can easily be shown that the result may have the effect of diminishing British trade, and throwing a greater quantity into foreign channels. I desire to take the earliest opportunity available of recording my protest against such an important matter being settled without the House having an opportunity to debate it. Even if the regulation were passed immediately, there would be no opportunity to debate it. The proposal should have been submitted to the House just as were the Canadian tariff proposals, which I support, and which, with the infliction of this regulation in addition, may be the means of entirely prohibiting the importation of British newsprint, as the Canadian and British productions will come in on the same basis. </para>
