He suggested that there was dissatisfaction owing to delay, and a probability of strikes in consequence. I have made inquiries, and I am informed by the  President  of the Arbitration Court that the matter is going on quite satisfactorily. The date for the hearing has been fixed. The unions concerned have made no complaints to the Court and do not ask for precedence over other unions, and before leaving for Darwin the  President  was assured by their accredited representative that there was no probability of a strike. </para>

            <para>- By way of explana tion of a question I propose to ask, may I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that some considerable time ago the House approved of the building of two ships for the Lighthouse Service. Recently steps were taken by some one to cancel the contract for the building of one of these ships. A tender was called for in a public way, the Cockatoo Island Dockyard was the successful tenderer, the contract was allotted and the agreement signed. I should like the Prime Minister to tell the House why the contract for one of the ships was cancelled. If he does not know, will he have inquiries made to ascertain the reason for the cancellation of the contract? </para>

          <para>- I desire to inform the House that the British Government is referring certain difficulties under constitutional law, which have arisen in connexion with the Irish Boundaries Commission, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the Lord Chancellor is most anxious that Dominion Judges should sit as members of that Committee. An invitation has been issued to Australia to consent to the services of the Chief Justice of the High Court being made  available. It is understood that a similar invitation has been issued in regard to the Chief Justice of Canada. Although it is extremely difficult to make the services of the Chief Justice of the High Court available, the Government has felt that there is an obligation to comply with the wish of the British Government in this matter, and it has accordingly cabled agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox serving up.on the Committee. He will leave for Great Britain by,.the <inline font-style="italic">Moldavia,</inline> which sails on the 10th June. </para>

            <para>- I assume that the honorable member&#39;s question refers, not to broadcasting, but to wireless telegraphic communication generally. During the past week-end, not merely was telegraphic communication possible, but the human voice was actually heard by the beam method of transmission. It is evident from this that the discoveries which have recently been made in further advancement of long-distance wireless transmission, suggest the very greatest prospect of some satisfactory arrangement by which we shall have direct communication with the Mother Country in the near future. At the moment, however, I have no statement to make, although I am in communication with the British Government in regard to the matter. </para>

            <para>.- The motion is a formal one, and is moved for the purpose of discussing a matter of the greatest importance, which you, sir, have just stated. I am only sorry that, notwithstanding my desire to compress my observations into the smallest reasonable compass, it will be, I am afraid, impossible for me to deal with the whole subject in the short space of half an hour. I shall, therefore, have to ask the indulgence of honorable members for a slight extension. I take it that it needs no argument to establish the seriousness of supplying misleading departmental information to this Chamber, to its members, or to representative organizations outside. The case is much more serious when the misrepresentations are considered and deliberate, as in this case. Honorable members know perfectly well that Ministers, for the information they give to this House in answer to questions, are largely dependent upon the good faith and integrity of our public Departments. Honorable members know, equally, that the House itself is largely dependent, in respect of its legislation for the whole of Australia, upon information so received. I am happy to be able to say that it has been, I think, our general experience that the trust which we have placed in our public Departments has not been abused. It would be a very grave matter if we had in this country a secret bureaucracy, working behind closed doors and acting in, contempt of Parliament. I undertake to prove that this case is an exception to that good record to which I have referred and admitted. I undertake to prove that the members of the Repatriation Commission, and at least one senior officer of the Department, have deceived and misled members of this House in circumstances that show conclusively wilful deliberation on the part of one or more of the persons concerned. I am in the happy position of being able to base my case upon records already published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and upon written communications bearing the signatures of the officers concerned. Some few gaps I shall fill in during this address. The persons to whom these misleading statements were deliberately made - the case goes back a considerable time - were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. </para>

I am satisfied that he has been cruelly wronged, but if I refer to the details of his case it is merely for the purpose of establishing the proposition I have set out to prove, which is a much more serious matter than the wrongs of any individual case could possibly be.

He spent five or six hours on the deck of the destroyer, and a night in a shed at Plymouth, all of which resulted in a bad cold, which developed, and, after four weeks&#39; training, he was sent back to Australia and discharged medically unfit. 22nd December, 1917. </para>
          <para class="block">Tuberculosis had not manifested itself as early as that date, but now Holland is at an advanced stage of that disease. I do not guarantee the accuracy of minute details which are not essential to my case, but I guarantee the accuracy of every essential detail.

          <para class="block">I ask honorable members to note the fact - although they may not see the importance of it for the moment - that the letter contains no request for a pension for Holland, but is simply a kindly inquiry from a man who is now dead, but who was grossly deceived in the reply he received from the Repatriation Department on the 13th of July, 1920. That letter, which was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Ryan, Deputy</inline> Commissioner, was as follows: - </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-style="italic">Re</inline>ex-No.  3088, Private Holland, William, 38th Battalion. - Enlisted, 6th January, 1917; discharged, 22nd December, 1917; served, England; disability, over age; pension, nil. In answer to your communication  of  8th July regarding the above-mentioned man, I have to inform you that Holland served in England only; he continued camp training until 2nd August, 1917, when;  on  account  of  his age,  he  was medically boarded and returned to Australia. He was not  in  hospital during this time, and  on  his return was medically boarded at No. 11 Australian General Hospital, and discharged immediately for senility. His incapacity due  to  war service was assessed as nil. He was 60 years of age when  he  enlisted, but gave his age to the Defence Department  as  44 years. Several Medical Boards have examined this man between 2nd August, 1917, and 4th February, 1920; on behalf of the Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments, and their opinions are unanimous that military service has not caused nor aggravated his present physical condition, which is due to age and constitution.Re s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat.</inline> - His claim that  he  suffered from the torpedoing of the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> is  not feasible, in that  he  continued training without any hospital attention, nor has he claimed his <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> experience as a cause  of  his asthma until last March. It is noted that the troops disembarked from the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> into boats, and were not subjected to extra hardships  or  immersion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland&#39;s</inline> ease has been fully considered by this Department and the honorary medical consultants, and also by the Commission, which body has decided that, as his present trouble  is not due to nor aggravated by his war service, repatriation benefits cannot be granted in this case. </para>
          <para class="block">At this stage I acquired certain information from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe,</inline> secretary of the branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League to which I have referred, acting for his organization, and from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayton, president</inline> of the Fathers Association.

The first Board was constituted by Lieut.-Colonel Embling, who, I have already said, was Holland&#39;s commanding officer. He had had this patient under observation for no less than two years. He associated himself with the two other doctors as a Board, and it found as I have said. As the result of that, the Principal Medical Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sturdee,</inline> constituted what is known as a Finalization Board. That was the second Boards As a result of its finding, Holland was detailed by the Principal Medical Officer for a pension, and the whole matter was minuted by General Brand, the State Commandant for Victoria, so that in the most solemn way possible these medical men, who knew best, declared that Holland&#39;s condition had been &#34; caused by or aggravated by his military service.&#34; </para>

This communication refers to the  Chairman  of the Repatriation Commission, and I have been quoting also a letter signed by the  Deputy  Commissioner for Repatriation, but I say that there is the strongest possible internal evidence that the man responsible in this case, the manwho is deeply involved in it, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece,</inline> the  Deputy Chairman.  I declare, without the slightest hesitation, that he continually prevaricated in connexion with the matter, sometimes audaciously and extravagantly, and sometimes with subtle&#39; hypocrisy, but where he had to choose between candour and its opposite, he shunned the truth, and deliberately went the way of those who, by tradition, are required to have long memories. The sentence beginning with the words &#34; Since he first claimed a pension &#34; is an audacious perversion of the truth. To prove it, I turn now to the answers to questions which I asked in this House.

          <para>Honorable members will observe that these reports were made before Holland&#39;s discharge and application for a pension, and also before he had any serious ailment. . The reports are negative in character, and colourless. I do not blame the doctors; they were no doubt quite correct in saying that the man&#39;s incapacity was nil. At that time his disease had not developed, and it was not possible to diagnose the condition in which he would be one, two, or three years later. One of these Boards, with a supreme burst of humour, said that his disabilitywas over age, and it added &#34;not due to war service.&#34; For the reasons I have mentioned, these reports may be disregarded; but I beg honorable members to remember that I am not now attempting to show conclusively that the balance of evidence is in Holland&#39;s favour. I ask members to bear in mind that the officials denied that there was any evidence on his side, whilst I am proving that there is very little evidence on their side, and a great deal on the side of Holland. There is one other report on which the Commission relied, and surely that will be revelant, because it relates to a much later time. It is a report by Lieut.-Colonel C. C.

Of course, I am told by certain departmental officers that the doctors saw the file, and those gentlemen of the Department are worshippers of the file; indeed, I am assured by some of them that I should not take notice of anything but the file, but curiously enough these same worshippers of the file have disregarded about three-quarters of its most important contents. Let it not be thought that I am casting ridicule upon Drs. Macknight and Deravin. Those gentlemen were, and arc, discharging a useful office in connexion with repatriation, and I have no doubt that their report was honest, and, to a certain extent, it may have been useful. One of those gentlemen I personally know to be the soul of honour and efficiency ; but note what follows. I find a letter addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan, Deputy</inline> Commissioner of Repatriation, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland,</inline> on the 5th of March, 1920- </para>

            <para>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st March, and in reply to inform .you that your presence was not necessary when the honorary consultants considered your case, the medical evidence on the file being sufficient to show that your present disability is neither due to nor aggravated by your war service. Honorable members will see that the officials have disregarded the last report, pointing out that the medical men merely concerned themselves with what was already on the file. </para>

              <para>- Exactly ; though possibly not so well. .The gentlemen who depend upon that report admit by letter that the examination by Drs. Macknightand  Deravin  meant little in that it was merely retrospective, and that the application was governed by what had taken place earlier. We, therefore, get this amazing result, that whilst the Commission referred- to the examinations that took place after the man applied for his pension, the startling truth is that after making his application he was never examined by a Board  of  medical men who gave a report adverse to his claim. In other words, whilst the officials declare that the medical evidence is unanimously on their side, as regards the statements they made relating to the period subsequent to the application, the medical evidence is unanimously in Holland&#39;s favour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> added in his letter, &#34; This decision -must be regarded as final.&#34; Then, of course, fol.loved formal expressions of regret from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that in the circumstances nothing could be done, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> and his League, with exemplary .perseverance, persisted in their efforts to get a pension or other redress for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland,</inline> and their activities drew from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> a letter dated the 19th May, 1922, in which he said - &#34;&#34; The Commission has now made .a complete perusal of Holland&#39;s file, and has decided that it cannot admit him for treatment at Macleod Hospital as there is no evidence to show that bis present condition is attributable to war service, either by &#34;way of origin or aggravation. </para>

            <para>In reply to your letter of the 19th July, I have to advise that the &#39;Commission has  disrewarded  none of the medical reports which were in the possession of the Department in connexion with the application of the abovenamed for pension. When Holland first applied for pension, the Medical Referee Board stated - &#34; In our opinion his present condition is not due to war service.&#34; The present grant being made by the Commission is purely of a compassionate nature, and is certainly not an admission that Holland was eligible in the first instance to receive a pension. </para>
            <para class="block">That letter reveals <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> practising dishonesty more carefully than hitherto. He raised a mean little quibble, which, however, has no legs, to which I shall refer in a moment.  His  passion for inaccuracy is shown by the statement that when Holland first applied for a pension, the medical board reported : &#34;In our opinion his present condition is not due to war service.&#34; That report was made, not when Holland first applied for a pension, but two years afterwards, if the answers given by the Commission to my questions are correct. </para>

              <para>- It was made by medical gentlemen who had not seen the patient. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> pressed the matter farther, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece,</inline> finding himself lost in a maze of inconsistencies and evasions, eventually took sanctuary in the safety zone of the prevaricator, by declining to answer anything further. It would have been much better for him if he had refused to do so earlier. Some questions will naturally &#39; suggest themselves to honorable members. They will ask, why should these deliberate statements be made when the file is on record to disprove thom? The answer to that question is happily at hand. Through the courtesy of  Colonel Luscombe,  of Base Records, the Defence files were made available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clayton,</inline> of the Soldiers&#39; Fathers&#39; Association, and they took copious extracts from them. The Repatriation Commission at first did not know this. Had the file not been thus revealed, this sad case would have been still embalmed in the archives of the Repatriation Commission, and nothing would ever have been heard of it. One wonders how many such cases there are of unfortunate returned men, who have not had the friends that this man has had to fight his case untiringly. One wonders what the records would disclose if some single-minded Commissioner of honest pur-pose were appointed to make investigation into these matters. When I asked for the file of documents, the Treasurer immediately over-ruled the  Deputy  Commissioner and, very properly, I think, made it available for my inspection in the library. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> and his <inline font-style="italic">confreres,</inline> knowing that other men had inspected the file, had no option bub to surrender, and make the best excuses they could. I shall be asked whether these gentlemen conspired together. I do not think so, as it will be possible to show that both  Colonel Semmens  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> knew little about the matter. The case was in the hands of one Commissioner; it was his case - he was dealing with similar cases - and he knew all about it. I do not allege conspiracy. It is important to consider the excuses that were made by these gentlemen, and I ask honorable members to bear with me a moment while I examine them. The questions show that reliance is placed on a pitiful quibble. It is stated that no medical board &#34; with access to all files has considered this man&#39;s condition as due .to or aggravated by his service,&#34; and running through the answers is the suggestion that none of the medical evidence I have quoted was worth even mentioning, because, although the Board had access to it and had it, it was not incidental to Holland&#39;s application for a pension. For that reason, apparently, the. Commission thought that what I have quoted this afternoon was not only unworthy of mention to honorable members of this House, but so worthless that it could not be extracted from them by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe.</inline> It was so unimportant that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ratcliffe</inline> called attention to it, Mi1. Teece would do anything rather than disclose its worthless existence. I remind honorable members of the sweeping phrase in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan&#39;s</inline> letter, which reads - </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Several Medical Boards have examined this man, between 2nd August. 1917. and 4th .February, 1920, on behalf of the Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments, and their opinions are unanimous that military service has not caused nor aggravated his present physical condition. </para>
          <para class="block">Honorable members will notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> there surveys the whole field of this man&#39;s military history. He is not concerned merely with his application for a pension; he mentions the date of his enlistment, throws doubt upon the fact that he was ever cast into the sea, points out that he was older than he said he was when he enlisted - though that was not regarded as a very great offence during the war - and that he served for only a short period in England. In a word, everything connected with this man&#39;s military history, from the time he enlisted to the present day, has been carefully paraded if in the remotest degree it is calculated to throw discredit on the man; but nothing in his career, however significant, or from however exalted an authority it might come, which tends in any way to establish his reputation or. the sound basis of his claim, is in any circumstances to be admitted or disclosed. It must be remembered, also, that two of the three reports upon which the Commission rely to bolster up their excuses were made prior to Holland&#39;s application for a pension. I have already shown that those reports are negative in character, colourless, and of little avail. Honorable members well know that the Repatriation Commission took over the Defence records. The Pensions Branch was first administered bythe Treasury. In 1920, the Repatriation Commission was established by an Act of this Parliament, and it became the bounden duty of that Commission to have before it the record - and especially the medical record - of every man with whom it had to deal. If anything further on that point is necessary, it is supplied in the fact that the Commission had before it these records on this man&#39;s file. They were there when the file was shown to me and when it was examined by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. MacGillicuddy,</inline> the doctor who made the latest examination of the case. I do not expect honorable members to assimilate the whole of these facts in a moment. I do not expect the Government to act - I am sure it will not - upon <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements made by me in this House. But I do say that I have made a most searching examination of the merits of this case, and of the relevant documents, and I have come deliberately to the conclusion that, not only is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> utterly unfit for the position which he holds, but that he is unfit to hold any position in the Public Service of this country. </para>

I have often, in debate, had occasion to cross swords with the honorable member; butI assure honorable members that I would, nevertheless, cheerfully leave it to him, if necessary, to decide whether, on the documents, I have not absolutely established my case.

I remind them, however, that if ever there were a matter from which the party aspect was absent this is such a matter. It will become a party matter only if the Government, because of a mistaken sense of its duty and of the position which it occupies, stands behind officers who have deceived honorable members. We may, indeed, &#34; throw up the sponge,&#34; if we are to be supplied by the Departments with distorted reports, and cannot rely upon the probity of our public servants. We may say harsh things about each other, but we have always confidently believed that at least we have been and are being honestly advised by the officers of the Departments. I leave the matter where it is, for the Government to take whatever action it thinks fit. If it does not take action, I shall endeavour to take such action as commends itself to me. </para>

            <para>. - A few days ago, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> asked me, as the Ministerial representative of the Repatriation Office,  certain questions, and I gave him very full replies. I point out that since I have been administering this Department I have made available to honorable mem- bers,  without any reservations, whatever files have been asked for by them. All I ask, as a medical man, and as one who knows exactly the point of view of patients, is that a man&#39;s private medical history should not be made public if to do so would be prejudicial to him. It was for that reason that, last year, I proposed the appointment of the Soldiers&#39; Committee to deal with these cases. The files are always available to honorable members when they  make  application for permission to peruse them. I am indebted to the honorable member for Batman for drawing my attention to this case. I confess that a perusal of the files to enable me to prepare a reply to the honorable member disclosed stupidity in the handling of the matter that was beyond my ability to comprehend-. It had been held, on the one hand, that this man was not entitled to a war pension, because his invalidity had not been caused by war service; while on the other hand he was refused an invalidity pension because his invalidity had occurred outside Australia ! </para>

              <para>- When I found how the matter had developed, I at once asked the Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions to tell me exactly what the position, was, and to make certain that, at any rate, an invalidity pension was granted to this man, who had gone overseas and shown a willingness to fight, even though he had not fought abroad. I found that, some two years previously, the Departments themselves had realized what a. stupid position had arisen, and instead of giving an invalid allowance - which, technically, it was not possible to give - the Repatriation Commission had made available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> a compassionate allowance equal to the invalidity pension of 30s. per fortnight. That allowance was giver to him on the 5th May, 1922, and it has since been increased by the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Board to 35s. a fortnight. Accordingly, during the whole of this year, he has drawn an amount equal to the present invalidity rate. The fact that the Repatriation Commission took action to secure that the invalid pension should not be withdrawn from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> discounts to a great extent the charge of animus on the part of the Commission towards this &#34;unfortunate soldier, which has been suggested by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> . </para>

              <para>- We must remember that the Repatriation Commission has to administer an Act which was passed by this Parliament after due deliberation. That Act contains a provision for the making of regulations. Whatever the desires of its members may be, the Commission can consider only the Act and the regulations made under it. Officers of the Department -have been charged with having made false statements, but what are the facts? Altogether six Boards have deliberated on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland&#39;s</inline> case. Of these, four were appointed for the purpose of ascertaining his right to a war pension. The other two were military Boards, quite inde-pendent  of repatriation, their object being to determine his capacity to- remain permanently in the home Forces. All the four Boards which inquired into the question of a pension were unanimous, as the letter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> states, that his disabilities were those of old age - emphysema and asthma. </para>

The two military Boards were those conducted by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Summons and <inline font-weight="bold">Major H.</inline> Irving. Their purpose was to determine whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> was capable of continuing in the home service. The first four Boards had before them <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland&#39;s</inline> whole medical history, as well as his application for a pension, or for discharge. They had access to the whole of the files, and their conclusions were based on that evidence. The Boards which inquired into his capacity for further service did not have regard to his past war service. They were not concerned whether his injuries were due to war service or not. They merely had to determine whether he was fit to remain in the service in the future. There is a material difference between the objects sought by the two Boards. It is admitted that this man was over age when he was accepted for military service, although he gave his age as 44 years. </para>

Instead, he went into training on Salisbury Plain, and it was not. until a period of a month or six weeks had elapsed that he made application for treatment, because of the effects which he said the torpedoing of the vessel had had on him. </para>

              <para>- It is not suggested that he is. I regret the stupid bungling which has taken place in connexion with his application for a pension. The torpedoing of the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> had practically no effect on him at all. All the medical statements of his condition while in the Forces are conclusive evidence to me, as a medical man, that he was suffering from chronic bronchitis and asthma, and that the conditions existing on the other side of the world were the cause of his return to Australia. I understand that, at present, although he is not a tubercular patient, he is suffering from chronic asthma and emphysema. </para>

Their reports, which may be read by honorable members, show that there was no necessity for further examination, and that in December, 1917, Holland was in a condition which, in my opinion, was permanent, . for whatever he might do, or wherever he might go, his chest condition would get worse. They dispose of the suggestion by the honorable member for Batman that the medical evidence regarding this man&#39;s condition was obtained, not by personal examination, but from files, and they prove that his capacity for further service was practically n.l. I am not able to-day, with the limited material at my disposal, to answer the charges made against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece,</inline> a member of the Repatriation Commission. Although the honorable member for Batman spoke about the &#34; bias &#34; of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece,</inline> he did not establish against him any definite charge of intent to interfere with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland&#39;s</inline> rights. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland,</inline> under the Acts which control pensions, was technically not entitled to a pension, the Repatriation Commission did what lay in its power, by granting him a compassionate allowance, to meet the special circumstances of the case. </para>

            <para>.- The House is indebted to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> for bringing the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> under notice. If inquiry is made it will be found that this case is typical of many others. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has endeavoured to cover up the shortcomings of his officers rather than to answer the statements made by the honorable member for Batman.. I am pleased to say that in the Departments of the Commonwealth generally we have very competent and reliable officers, who try to give honorable members all necessary information for their guidance. It would appear, however, that there is room . for a searching investigation regarding the action of the particular officer referred to by the honorable member, who stated that he did not charge officer&#39;s generally with conspiracy, but that he charged only one officer. That man, I understand, is the representative on the Board of the returned soldiers. </para>

              <para>- It is as well that he is so no longer. The honorable member for Batman charged that officer with giving misleading information to honorable members and to the House. When a case is presented to honorable members they should be able to obtain reliable information from officials controlling the Department concerned. It has been shown that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> was misled because he was not supplied with the complete information, and the honorable member for Batman has been similarly misled. Even the Treasurer, when he answers questions in the House, is not in possession of the fullest possible information. He has stated that at least two Boards out of four reported that the man was not suffering from any disability due to war service. The other two Boards were asked to report upon his ability to continue in the military Forces. As against that, the honorable member for Batman has shown that two other Boards, making six in all, have also reported on the case, and that they reported that he Was suffering from incapacity resulting from war service. </para>

              <para>- Of the four Boards referred to by the Treasurer, two reported against the man, and two in favour of him. In addition, there are four opinions by doctors stating that the man is suffering in consequence of war service. There are two Boards opposed to two Boards, and four medical testimonies in favour of the man. His disability occurred some time after he was discharged. Every member of the House has had similar cases brought under his notice. Men known personally to honorable members have been discharged as fit, but one, two, or three years afterwards, have become, as a result of their war services, physical wrecks. </para>

              <para>- And I have presented many others to the Government. It is one of the most difficult things in the world to get a medical Board to testify that their condition is due to war service. It does not matter whether this man was over age when he enlisted. I can recall the time when we applauded men who were over age and enlisted, for it was argued that their action was evidence of their anxiety to serve their country. The question is, &#34;Were they fit for active service ? &#34; If a doctor appointed by the Government passed an applicant as fit to go abroad, that man surely has a claim upon this country when his health is impaired by the service he rendered. If he was accepted for active service, if he went abroad, and if, as a result of active service, he is incapacitated in any way, how can we shirk our responsibility? </para>

              <para>- No, and it should not be. There are many more who, like him, enlisted when they were over the age limit. I have a case in my mind of a father of seven sons. He and four of the sons went to the war, and one of the sons was killed. The father was over age when he enlisted, and upon his return to this country he was discharged from the forces as fit. Within twelve months, as a result of shock received at the front, he became an inmate of an asylum. </para>

          <para class="block">He received no recognition from the Government, notwithstanding the services that he and his family had rendered. The time has arrived when, in justice to such men, the Government should issue an. order providing that when there is any doubt about the cause of an ex-soldier&#39;s incapacity, he should be given the benefit of it. I am quite certain that honorable members will agree with me when I say that there are many young and middleaged men who have come back from the front and, with large hearts, have commenced to work, who, after a year or two, when they have found themselves partially incapacitated as a result of their war services, have had their applications for pensions rejected because their incapacity was held not to have occurred as a result of war service. Is it likely, that the health of these able-bodied men would have broken down except as a result of war service ? </para>

              <para>- Yes. This Department should be administered sympathetically. Such a man cannot legally be granted an invalid pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, because the disability arose overseas. The authorities, however, have granted a compassionate allowance of 10s. a week, which is a &#34;munificent&#34; sum to pay to any person in such circumstances. I question very much whether the Board has the power to grant even a compassionate allowance, although it has done so in this instance. In addition to the paltry sum just mentioned, this man is allowed an invalid pension of 5s. a week, and, as the incapacity occurred overseas, even that amount cannot, I think, be legally paid. This unfortunate man is receiving a paltry 15s. per week when the invalid pension is 17s. 6d. per week. </para>

              <para>- That is. a. ridiculous sum to pay a man. against whom the only charge that can be laid is that he enlisted when over 45 years of age. Whatever his age may have been at the time of enlistment, he rendered good service to his country, and, prior to enlistment,&#39; was passed by the doctor as sound. Subsequently he became incapacitated, and the Board, which is supposed to treat such cases sympathetically, has declined to recognize his claim. This case is similar to many others, and, although it is necessary to reduce expenditure in this Department as far as possible, such expenditure should only be reduced legitimately, as Parliament or the Australian people do not want an injustice to be done to any man who served in the Great War. When we were seeking recruits, it was said, from every platform, that we would stand by those who offered their services, and would see that they were provided for. We have now no right to quibble in regard to matters of this kind, and to deny sustenance to the man who has perhaps a wife and family to keep, and who rendered excellent service at the war. This case is so glaring that it demands immediate attention. Every one disregards the question of age. It must be admitted that an incorrect age was given, not for the purpose of deriving any benefit, but simply with the desire to serve. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and the action of such men was applauded. I do not think the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> should endeavour to protect the officials by covering up their conduct. A searching inquiry should be made, not only into this case, but into others of a similar character, so that justice may be done &#39;to those who have been unduly penalized. It is heartrending to listen to the stories told by many similarly placed. The case of a married man with a wife and two children has been brought under my notice. When he came back from the war, he returned to his employment at the &#39; Newcastle Steel Works. He had some trouble in his left knee, which he thought was due to a bump, but which afterwards extended up the left arm, and is to-day so acute that he cannot work. This man is receiving only one-half the full pension rate, as he is regarded as 50 per cent, incapacitated. He cannot work at all, and his claim for a full pension is turned down on the ground that his incapacity is not due to war like operations, although he was 50 per cent. incapacitated when he returned. One could quote dozens of such cases. Although we wish to reduce the heavy repatriation expenditure we should not deny justice to these men. I trust the Government will see the necessity of acting promptly in an endeavour to clear this matter up, and if any one in the Service has been guilty of misleading Ministers or honorable members that person should not be allowed to remain in the Public Service. I do not say that any one has wilfuly misled Ministers, but if it can be proved that that has been done the guilty person or persons should be dismissed, as such action would be a deterrent to others. The Department of Repatriation should, as I have said, be administered sympathetically and on the same lines as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions branch. I doubt very much whether the time has not arrived when the Repatriation and Invalid and Oldage Pensions branches should be amalgamated and placed under the control of those now administering the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, as the officers in that branch know how to deal with these cases. Something should be done immediately, and a decision should be arrived at in order to prevent cases such as that mentioned by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> being brought before this House. Nearly one-third of our time is occupied in discussing repatriation matters, and the Government should decide to recognize the claims submitted in this and other similarcases; and thus put an end to the controversy which prevails in regard to men who have become incapacitated after being discharged, and whose incapacity is undoubtedly due to war services. </para>

            <para>. - I am very glad the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has brought this matter before the House to-day, but I am extremely sorry that there should have been any necessity for doing so. As, however, there appears to be a necessity, it is just as well the case has been ventilated in order that we may know exactly the attitude the Government intend to adopt in regard to the numerous complaints submitted. I know the individual concerned, and if he had been one of my constituents I should have brought the matter forward myself prior to this. Knowing what I do of the case, and having read a good deal of what is contained in the files in connexion with it, I can come only to the conclusion arrived at by the honorable member for Batman, that there is an urgent need for the appointment of either a Select Committee or a Royal Commission to make the fullest inquiry, not only into this case, but into scores of others of a similar nature. Most honorable members will admit that they, too, have heard of cases, perhaps not so glaring as this, in which the injustice shown to returned soldiers and their dependants has been very marked. I have had personal experience in connexion with a number when it has been necessary to ask that the files be brought to the House for perusal, and I have been amazed at the apparent lack of sympathy which has characterized the decisions of those in authority. Reference has been made to the fact that this man incorrectly stated his age when he enlisted; but, as other honorable members have said, he was only one of many. </para>

              <para>- Yes, there were probably thousands. I know a member of the remount section of the Light Horse who, after the doctor had questioned him very critically regarding his age because of a breakdown overseas, admitted to me that he would be 70 years of age on his next birthday, which was then only a few months ahead. By reason of a clean and industrious life he appeared to be at least fifteen years younger than he actually was. That man answered his country&#39;s call. If Holland had been drowned when he was submerged in the torpedoed <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat,</inline> would the Government have questioned the right of his wife and dependants to a pension?

              <para>- Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holland</inline> survived his immersion, medical testimony proves that he is suffering in consequence of it. In those circumstances, the Government cannot relieve itself of its obligations. Holland was accepted for service at the time he offered for enlistment, and the Government then accepted responsibility which it cannot now shed. A careful consideration of hundreds of cases of war-service pension claims in Australia would prove to the satisfaction of any unbiased person that many returned men are suffering from injustice because adverse decisions have been given in their by departmental Boards. </para>

          <para class="block">The Board of the 3rd of February recommended that Holland should be granted&#39; a continuation of half pay, but the, later Board determined that he was 100 per cent. incapacitated. Possibly it recommended that he should undergo hospital treatment for one month so that he could be under observation. I have seen Holland recently, and one has only to look at him to realize that the Treasurer spoke truly when he said that there was. no possibility ofhim recovering from his disability, which undoubtedly has been aggravated by war service. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer will cause a careful inquiry to be made into this case, and that he will also make provision for inquiry into similar cases in which returned soldiers or their relatives claim to be suffering from adverse departmental decisions. I hope that it will not be necessary much longer to bring such cases before this House. </para>

            <para>.- I do not think that the general question of the treatment of returned soldiers should have arisenin this debate. The most important element in the speech by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was the serous charge he made against an officer of one of our Departments. I suggest to the Treasurer that it is his duty to promise the House that a proper investigation will be made into this matter. If the Government does not appoint a Committee of Inquiry, honorable members will be given an opportunity to say whether or not such a Committee should be appointed. The Treasurer endeavoured, but failed lamentably, to answer the serious charge made by the honorable member for Batman. He quoted three dates in 1917, and one in 1920, on which inquiries were made into the case of Private Holland. The first three inquiries were made before the man applied for a pension and the last one mentioned by the Treasurer was made by a Committee which did not even see him. The Treasurer gave us what he said was the unanimous  finding of this Board, that Holland, was not entitled to a pension. Judging from the speech of the Treasurer, one would think that the inquiries ho mentioned were the only ones made into the case. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer quoted the decisions of three Boards which considered Holland&#39;s case before he applied for a pension, and one other Board which met on the 4th of February, 1920, and decided against him without even seeing him. The honorable member for Batman produced the opinion of the two medical Boards, after the date on which Private Holland applied for a pension, that his inability was aggravated by war service. How can the Treasurer get over the opinions of those Boards, and also the opinions of four different medical officers? Although two Medical Boards and four doctors declared that Holland&#39;s condition was aggravated . by his war service, the Repatriation Department wrote, stating that Boards appointed under the Defence, the Pensions, and the Repatriation Departments were unanimous in the decision that this man&#39;s condition was not due to war service, nor was it aggravated by it. What is the answer to  that ? It is of no use to say that the honorable member for Batman has suggested animus. He did not say that there was animus, but that there was deception. The Treasurer says that the honorable member has not made a definitecharge, but he has made several definite charges, and has produced the official replies of the Department. If ever a case for investigation was made out in this House, surely this is one. I direct attention to something significant in the reply by the Treasurer. . He said that it was found that a very stupid position had arisen. He said that this man was refused a military pension because his disability was not due to war service, and was refused an invalid pension because his disability did not arise within Australia. It was admittedly due to war service. When the Government discovered this stupid blunder, did it make good this man&#39;s loss? It promised that he would be given back pension. The amount due was something like &#163;30, but such was the animus of some one against the man that he was given none of this money. They said that as his condition was not due to war service he was entitled to receive an invalid pension, but he was not given an invalid pension because the officials knew full well that his disability occurred outside Australia, and consequently he could not be given an invalid pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. That was the reply given to the man when he made his application for an invalid pension. The Repatriation Department, of which the Treasurer is the head, just as he is the head of other Pensions Departments, had to get out of the difficulty as best it could. The Government had said that it could not give this man an invalid pension because, his disability occurred outside Australia, but that he would be given a. compassionate allowance under the War Pensions Act, admitting that the disability occurred through war service outside Australia. The case, as presented by the honorable member for Batman, was one of the most carefully prepared that I have listened to. I commend the honorable member for his industry, and for the courage with which he has faced -the position, because it is not a pleasant one. Nor is it pleasant for honorable members to have to support this charge. I have received numerous replies from officials, and have accepted them in good faith. Most honorable members are in the habit of doing so. Whatever our differences of opinion may be we accept  communications  from the heads of Departments as honorable and straightforward statements of the matters with which they deal. It is clear, from the facts presented by the honorable member for Batman, that the reflection upon one officer in particular is a serious one, and the matter should not be allowed to rest where it is. If the Government desiresto face the position in a proper manner it will have an investigation made into this case, or the House will be asked to do so by specific motion. </para>

            <para>,- I commend the honorable member for Batman for bringing this matter before the House. It affords an opportunity to the Treasurer to give practical effect to a suggestion made last session. The Soldiers&#39; Committee of members of this House, appointed to consider these cases, has not yet been clothed with sufficient powers to give effect to the wishes of honorable members generally. That Committee would be amenable to this House, and would be more likely than officials to give a decision in each case based upon the facts as it found them. The fault in these cases does not lie entirely with the Repatriation Commission, but with the policy of the Government in 1921, when it made a drastic out into pensions all round. There was an outcry everywhere against that action. One case was brought forward by the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> when I was not present owing to the misleading report supplied to the House with regard to me. In connexion with that report, some person who ought to have been removed is still holding his job. He unfairly assailed my honour and courage, and, though I do not wish to parade them, I can say that my work, so far as my limits permitted, was equal to that of any other man. In the present case, in all probability, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> will continue to hold his job, although he has been responsible for doing a man out of his rights. The man towhose case I refer was paid a pension for four years because of disability due to rheumatism contracted in Egypt. He was a navvy on the East-West railway when he passed  the medical officer and went overseas to fight for the country. For four years he was paid a full pension, but at the close of the year, 1920, he received this reply to an application he made - </para>

            <para>I have to advise you that the Repatriation Commission, Melbourne, having considered all the facts of the case, decided that your disability was not due to war service, and cancelled your war pension, but the principal departmental medical officer recommends that you apply for an invalid pension, as you are apparently eligible for same. </para>
            <para>When this man was joining up to fight for Australia he left a job of navvying on the Nullarbor Plains, which only a physicallyfit man could carry on. He contracted rheumatism in Egypt, and on his return was paid a pension. As a result of the policy adopted by the Government there was a drastic and cruel revision of pensions, and this man was informed that he was not incapacitated through war. service, although he had been paid a war pension for four years. He was told to apply for an invalid pension, and he is now to be seen with the members of theFig-tree Club opposite the post office in Adelaide, where the derelicts of the city are accustomed to . gather. Apart from his rheumatism, he is an able-bodied man, and, if the Treasurer doubts the statement, he can see him marching about the streets of Adelaide to-day, an illustration of the generosity of the nation to a man who gave service overseas as a soldier. The case was ventilated by the honorable member for Angas away back in 1921, and the facts are&#39; as I have stated them. If he had so desired, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teece</inline> might have interviewed this man personally in his native town of Adelaide, and might have seen for himself whether the doctors had made a mistake in his case or not. He did not choose to do so. The only way I see out of the difficulty is to clothe the soldiers&#39; committee of members of this House with authority sufficient to deal with these cases. It would be an independent authority which would decide upon facts outside the records, and, if necessary, interview applicants, and it would be responsible to this House for the decisions at which it arrived. If that course were adopted this case, as well as others which may arise in the future, might be satisfactorily and justly dealt with. </para>

          <para>- On the 7th May, the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> referred to the recent murder of a seaman on the H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> and I stated that instructions had already been given for a departmental inquiry to be held. I have now received the report of the Court of Inquiry, which shows that a strict and careful investigation into the circumstances attending the deaths on board the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> of Ordinary Seaman George Ritchie, and Cook George Brown, was made. The Court is of the opinion that Ordinary Seaman Ritchie met his death at the hands of some one unknown, but that, from the circumstantial evidence produced, Cook Brown, who afterwards committed suicide, is indicated strongly as having been the murderer. No motive was apparent, but some evidence goes to show that Brown was a man of low mentality. The Court is further  of the opinion that a considerable amount of rumour was going through the ship that the man Brown was suspected of having been responsible for other assaults, and it is considered that a lack of initiative was shown by petty officers in not bringing it under notice that these rumours were current in the ship. The finding of the Court is concurred in by the Commodore Commanding H.M.A. Fleet, who considers that while no actual blame is attributable to those who failed to report the rumours, they should have taken more energetic action to investigate them. The whole matter was considered by the Naval Board, which recognizes that where only rumour or bare suspicion exists it is difficult to present a case officially, but in view of other acts of violence with which the name of Cook Brown had been associated, the Board considered that the Petty Officers concerned should have taken further action than they did in bringing to the notice of the officers of the ship the feeling that existed in regard to Brown, although in the entire absence of evidence it is difficult to see what could have been done except to take care that the suspect was kept under observation. In view of the fact that in the case bare suspicion was the only thing the Petty Officers had to go upon, the Naval Board concurred in the report of the Commodore Commanding, and no further action was considered necessary. I concur in the opinion of the Naval Board. </para>

          <para>- I was hoping that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> would give the Committee some information concerning this clause. The attitude of the Government in this matter is in marked contrast with their attitude when the constitution of the Federal Capital Commission was under consideration. Honorable members were advised as to the cost and duties of the Commission. This Board will, in all probability, incur an expenditure of &#163;10,000 per annum, and yet the Minister has given no information as to its duties. The language of the clause, so far as the appointment of a pastoralist of the Northern Territory is concerned, is indefinite. The machinery to set up such an important Board should be precise and definite. We should know where we stand. The other day the honorable member forBass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> stated that a section of the Board had already been appointed. </para>

            <para>- -Then I say that members of the Pastoralists Association of the Northern Territory should not be overlooked. The Minister has given us an assurance that they will have a chance. They will not, because, according to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 11, a member of the Board will not be permitted to hold any interest in land apart from that which may be necessary for his home. In this matter the Government are not consistent. There was no suggestion, in connexion with the appointment of the Federal Capital Commission, that the two members who might draw in fees as much as &#163;2,000 per annum should not engage in any other occupation. Likewise, there should be no restriction upon the business or occupation of members of the Northern Territory Land Board, because we want on that Board men who have done the pioneering work, and are in the best position to advise as to the policy for Northern Territory development. </para>

            <para>- That is different. If the Board is to be so constituted as to be able to advise as to the development of the Northern Territory, these men should not be shut out. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> hinted that one man might assume control of the Board. That is absurd. It is not likely that the two persons appointed by the Minister would be overruled. If the Board is constituted from the persons who met at Scott&#39;s Hotel it will not be conversant with the details of Northern Territory pioneering. </para>

            <para>- The Minister stated that it was not a developmental Bill. He also admitted that the Government were trying to break down certain monopolies now existing in the Territory. I fail to see how that end can be achieved. The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> claimed that the election of a member of the Board would take too long. I remind him that, in the election of a parliamentary representative of the Northern Territory there was only six weeks between the issue and the&#39; return of the writ. As a matter of fact, very little time would be occupied in electing a representative of the pastoralists on the Land Board, because the opinions of the pastoralists could easily be ascertained by making use of the telegraph. </para>

            <para>- The person elected need not necessarily be a leaseholder, bub if the people of the Territory wish one of the small leaseholders to be appointed to the Board, they should have the right to nominate him, and the person so chosen should be given time to dispose of any property in the Territory in which he might be interested. There are many leases in which there are fourteen or fifteen persons interested, and, if one of those persons were chosen, it would be an easy matter for him to dispose of a fourteenth or a fifteenth interest in a lease. The Bill, as it stands, prevents such a person from being a member of the Board. The choice of a man who knows the Territory from A to Z will obviate the necessity for the Board spending many months ingoing over the Terriritory to become acquainted with it. There will be no chance for the representative of the pastoral industry to dominate the Board, seeing that the Board will contain two Government nominees. The honorable member for Bass referred to the possibility of a surveyor being chosen. I am not enamoured of the idea of having a surveyor on such a Board. As a rule, a surveyor is one who has specialized in his own profession, and honorable members who have had any experience of surveyors&#39; reports on pastoral areas know that they are far from being reliable, and are often misleading. No one is more qualified to furnish a report upon the pastoral capabilities of the land than is a man who has a knowledge of the pastoral industry, and practical experience in it. When the honorable member for Bass declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford</inline> knew more about the Territory than any other man I took exception to the remark, because, although I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford</inline> is a very able man. I am also aware that there are other men who know more about the Territory than he does. Clause 11, which precludes any Northern Territory pastoralist from occupying a position on the Land Board, is inconsistent with the principle accepted in the constitution of the Canberra Commission. </para>

          <para>. - According to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of this clause, a member of the Board shall be deemed to have vacated his office if he, in any way, directly or indirectly, is interested in any land, other than as a place of residence for himself or his family, in the Northern Territory. I have a recollection of provision recently being made in a Bill to enable the  Chairman  of a Board to hold an interest in a company. I know men who would be highly suitable for appointment to a Board such as is contemplated under the Bill, but their land interests, though small, would render them ineligible for appointment. Will the Minister make the clause more elastic? </para>

Their duties will be of an important nature, and the Government&#39;s wish is to secure the best advice possible on pastoral matters in the Northern Territory.

            <para>- Yes. The Government always has the making of appointments to Boards of this nature, and if the selection were made by a particular section of people in the Northern Territory, the person so chosen might have greater regard for the welfare of that section than for the interests of the Government. It might be worth while a small pastoralist abandoning his pastoral interests in the Territory for the sake of taking a position on the Board. </para>

            <para>- I would certainly appoint a land-holder of character, just as State Governments usually constitute their Land Boards of two Government servants and a man selected by the Government from among thefarmers. A Board of three persons, which included  no man of extended experience of the Northern Territory, would be at the greatest possible disadvantage. What confidence would the lessees of a Territory have in the Board if they were not directly represented by a man who understood pastoral conditions in that country. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> argued that whereas the members of the proposed Federal Capital Commission will be permitted to have an interest in a firm doing business with the Commission, interested persons will be disqualified for a seat on the Board to be appointed under this Bill. There is no analogy between the two instances. The Bill relating to the Federal Capital Commission does not debar a Commissioner from having a shareholder&#39;s interest in certain business transacted by the Commission, whilst this measure provides that a member of the Board shall not have a direct interest in the land which the Board will be required to administer. </para>

Such a person may be a lease-holder, or a station-manager. The honorable member has mentioned the name of one man who knows as much about the &#91;Territory as does any other person whohas been there, and he would be a suitable person to appoint to the Board, but he could not, if appointed, retain his present position. There are in Northern Central Queensland, and North-western Australia, many men who would be qualified to help in the administration of this Ordinance, because they are familiar with country and pastoral conditions almost identical with those in the Territory. </para>

          <para>.- This clause contains an unusual provision. It empowers the Board to reject the application of persons who are deemed unsuitable, and then provides that the Board shall, at the request of the applicant, furnish its reasons for being satisfied that the applicant is unsuitable. There might be many reasons why a Board considered an applicant unsuitable, but if they stated those reasons to the applicant their stay in the Territory . might be as brief as was that of some officials who were hunted out of the Territory. Sub-clause 3 should not be allowed to remain unless there is very good reason for it. An applicant might be suspected of cattle duffing, and it would be awkward for the Board if they were required to explain that that was their reason for rejecting his application. I have never known a magistrate to be required to give the reasons for his decisions on the Bench. </para>

          <para>. -  I wish to ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> why it is that the appeal is purely to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory? This seems to be a rather unusual provision ; because, for instance, section 44 of the Land Tax Assessment Act provides -  (1.) Any taxpayer or person may, within the prescribed time, appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction, the Supreme Court, or a County or District Court of a State, or such other court as is specified in that behalf by proclamation, against any assessment by the Commissioner with respect to his land, on the ground that he is not liable for the tax, or any part thereof, or that the assessment is excessive.  (2.)  When the appeal is to the High Court or a Supreme Court, it shall be heard by  a.  single Justice of the Court. </para>

I am ata loss to understand why the lessee of land in the Northern Territory should not have the opportunities of recourse to law that are given to lessees in other parts of Australia. It appears obvious that there should be an ultimate appeal to the High Court from the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and I should like the Minister to explain why such an appeal is not provided for. </para>

          <para>. - In framing this clause as it stands, it was thought that a Judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court would have a better knowledge of local conditions than would a Supreme Court Judge in one of the States. The appeal that the honorable member contends is denied by this clause will, under the Northern Territory Supreme Court Ordinance, lie with the High Court. But it was thought that it would be a better procedure, and one less expensive, to allow pastoralists to appeal against a re-appraisement to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory instead of having to approach the High Court. </para>

        <para>In all the existing Commonwealth Acts and Ordinances, and also in the South Australian Acts, there are covenants for improvements such as fencing. For quite  a number of years they have not been enforced in the Northern Territory, and in many cases I agree -with the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister in control in not enforcing them. We know that in untimbered country, without railway facilities, it is very costly to fence, -and, from 1899 onwards, those administerthe Territory have seen fit to exempt lessees from the fencing conditions. What it was competent for Governments to do in tlie. past it will be competent for them to do in the future, until the enforcement of these conditions is warranted by the provision of a railway or other means of -transport. This proposed paragraph -should be included in the Bill, but remain inoperative, until such time as its enforcement is warranted. If a railway were constructed through timbered country, and thence through the heart of a station, there would be no reason why that holding should not be fenced. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. I do not think it fair that the Commonwealth should be asked to spend millions of pounds on railways through these particular leases if improvement conditions are not to be enforced. Of course, I am aware that the Bill contains a provision under which the Board can impose conditions on subsequent lessees, but I fail to sec why exemption should be granted to those who at present hold absolutely the best of our land in the Northern Territory. It appears to me that this is not a developmental Bill, and it ought to be made developmental by the insertion of the amendment. I am unable to see in what way the settlers would thereby be harassed. If suspension be possible under existing Acts, it should be possible under this measure. I believe that, by agreeing to the amendment, we would be safeguarding posterity, and would obviate the possibility of repudiation by future Governments. I know that repudiation is abhorred by members of the present Government. Ministers should, therefore, tackle this matter in a logical manner, and thus prevent any possibility of it. The Minister will probably attempt to argue that the stocking clauses will determine the extent of the improvements effected. I fail to see how they will prove advantageous in that direction. We have had something like .50- years&#39; experience of stocking conditions, and improvement of the holdings has not resulted, nor has the stock become better in quality. Clause 41 reads - </para>

        </list>
        <para class="block">Honorable members must see what will happen under that provision. The Territory is to be divided into four sections, each comprising something like 125,000 square miles. In each of those there is good, bad, and indifferent land. The Board will compute the average carrying capacity, and consequently the capacity fixed for the good areas will be no greater than that of the poorer land. I do not, therefore, anticipate that any material benefit will result from the stocking provisions. We know, also, that at present consideration cannot be given to what the land can actually carry. Take a run embracing 10,000 square miles; permanent water is to be found in certain parts, but there are thousands of miles of country on which water is. not procurable. I contend that the Board will have no power to estimate the carrying capacity of the land when improved; it must make its estimates in the light of existing conditions.

          <para>In South Australia, pastoral leases are issued under the Pastoral Acts for terms of 42 years, at rentals fixed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands. Re-appraisements are made after fifteen years. The lessee must expend 1.0s. per square mile per annum on improvements, as recommended by the Pastoral Board, and certain conditions are made in respect to stocking. : . . I submit to honorable members that the conditions which prevail in other parts of Australia must, necessarily, be the basis that this House must accept in fixing the conditions which should apply to leases of the Northern Territory pastoral lands. We should not be justified in disregarding the long experience of the States of Australia in respect to leasing pastoral country. </para>

        <para class="block">If we adopted the practice of requiring the expenditure of 10s. per square mile per annum on improvements, the annual expenditure of the lessee of an area of 12,000 square miles would be &#163;6,000. If we intend to proceed with the development of the Northern Territory, we should provide the machinery in the Bill. If that duty is neglected, a subsequent Parliament will be forced, in the interests of- Australia, to repudiate these  covenants, and insist that the making of improvements shall be one of the conditions. </para>

            <para>- Before the adjournment I was pointing out that the Treasurer had supported my contention, in that he said he must be guided by the experience of the States. His exact words were: &#34;We cannot disregard the long experience of the States.&#34; That statement followed a reference to the improvement conditions. In another place the Treasurer said, &#34; And,  a3  I have already pointed out, the best of the lands in the Northern Territory are held under South Australian Acts. They are closer to railways already constructed, and are likely to benefit most by railway construction in the immediate future.&#34; That is my chief contention - that these properties will benefit most by the construction of railways in the future. We should have some provision whereby the Board may impose conditions upon the holders of land which benefits from the construction of railways. The Treasurer said that there was nothing in the Ordinance itself to prevent improvement conditions from being imposed in any new lease, if the Government saw fit to do so. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 39 provides that pastoral leases shall contain reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions as follows : - </para>

        <para class="block">It is not fair to give a total exemption to those persons who, the Treasurer admits, are holding the very best of the land, while at the same time improvement conditions are imposed on the new lessees. It is the more unfair when we realize that subsequent leases will be for very inferior land to that held by the present big landholders. Yet, under the conditions of this Ordinance, new lessees can be forced to fence their holdings. The present leases are fast expiring. By their surrender the present lessees will secure a great concession, as they will obtain another 42 years&#39; use of the land. I fail to see the justice of imposing on new lessees conditions from which the- present land-holders are exempt. I would like the Minister to throw some light on clause 89, which reads - </para>

          <para>Notwithstanding the repeal of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act 1890 of the State of South Australia, the Fences Act 1892 and the Fences Act Amendment Act 1903 of the State of South Australia shall continue to apply to all freehold lands, and all lands held under agreement or lease from the Crown, in the Northern Territory, and in the application of those Acts the word &#34; fence&#34; or the words &#34; dividing fence &#34; wherever used therein shall bo deemed to mean any fence ordinarily, sufficient or capable of resisting the trespass of cattle or sheep. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That clause seems fairly definite. Both the Minister in charge of the Bill in this Chamber, and the Minister who introduced it in another place, stated definitely that land-holders were being encouraged not to improve their holdings. The Committee should be informed whether clause S9 will be applicable to all leases, whether under the new Ordinance or not. That would probably save a lot of unnecessary discussion. It is quite obvious that the Fences Acts are not to be repealed. In the event of a railway being constructed, or the conditions being made such that people, without any great hardship, could improve their lands for the better rearing of cattle or sheep, it would be possible for this clause to be put into operation. The statements to date have been very confusing. There is nothing in the covenants to the effect that the improvement conditions are to be continued. The Minister said that the covenants in respect&#39; to. improvements were the most stupid ever provided in an Ordinance. I desire to know whether the provisions of this clause could be enforced on subsequent lessees, as well as on the present ones. The Minister said we must first get rid of the big land-holders, but if we have not the power to force them to improve their leases, we shall never get rid of them. I would like the Minister to give us dome information respecting clause 89, as it applies to the various leases in the Northern Territory. </para>

          <para>. -  The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> desires to insert in every lease a covenant requiring the lessees to fence as prescribed. In the original Ordinance there was a clause to that effect, but the Department &#39;found it was&#39; -impracticable. Instead of causing the land to be used, it proved a bar to settlement. The effect was particularly hard in the case of the small settler. The object of the Ministry in leaving out of the Bill any obligation on the part of the lessees to effect improvements, is to encourage settlement. We have endeavoured, by indirect means, to secure the same result. For instance, the Bill contains stringent stocking conditions. If the lessees are to put the land to its proper use, improvements will be necessary. But they will have the right to say what those improvements shall be, and will notbe subject to dictation from some one outside. Experience has taught us that that is the best way to proceed. If we accepted this amendment now, we should be working against that principle. If the honorable member will look at clause 39, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> he will see the provision with reference to stocking. In paragraph c there is a covenant requiring the lessee to comply with the laws for the destruction of vermin. If the lessees are to keep sheep - as we hope they will - such a covenant will force them to provide some form of vermin - proof fencing. The object of the honorable member will be attained by the Bill in its present form, but it will be done by different means than he has suggested. In 1922 the Queensland Act was amended, with a view to improving the fencing conditions. Section 40, paragraph e, of the Land Act Amendment Act of 1922, reads- </para>

We are asked to endorse a certain clause, and we have a right to look to the Minister in charge of the Bill to give us the necessary information. I believe, with the Minister, that the clause has no bearing on existing leases, but in the conditions to be imposed upon pastoralists there is nothing relating to fencing. I refer the Minister to those parts of the Bill relating to cultivation, under the head of &#34; Agriculture.&#34; Clause 68 says that agricultural leases shall contain reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions as follows: - </para>

          <para>As I have already pointed out, the best of the lands in the Northern Territory are held under South Australian Acts. They are closer to railways already constructed, and are likely to benefit most by railway construction in the immediate future. </para>

        <para>If these men will benefit by the construction of a railway, it is logical to have a covenant so that they can be made to improve their land according to scientific requirements and the progress of pastoral development. I admit that in many instances, under present conditions, it would be impracticable and unfair to. ask people to make improvements, but with the advent of railways that objection could be entirely dismissed. The railways will go through timbered country, and it will be to the advantage of the pastoral industry as a whole to have the land fenced.When a man holds 10,000 or 12,000 square miles of country he will hesitate as long as possible before fencing it. There should be a clause in the Bill so that when the railway is built lessees can be compelled to improve their land. It is idle for the Minister to say that they will naturally do these things. Some of them have been there for 50 years, and have done nothing to improve their land. It is very significant that the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has not spoken on this Bill, although he went through the country. Is the Minister in charge of the Bill afraid that the Minister for Works and Railways, being a practical man, may tell the Committee what he has seen? I am satisfied that if he would tell the Committee what he saw on his recent trip, a different complexion would be put on the matter. Apparently he has been designedly prevented from speaking. Some of the holders will not. even put a pick in the ground to conserve water. They rely entirely on the. permanent waters, and will continue to do so until the end of their leases. The Minister has told us that the stocking conditions will force them to make improvements. I reiterate that it is impossible for any one to form an intelligent estimate of the stocking conditions of any lease of 10,000 square miles of land without an ounce of. water on it. When dealing with such land one must say- that its carrying capacity is nil, but the Minister for Works and Railways knows that a little expenditure of money and energy by the station owners would so improve.it that it would be capable of carrying thousands of stock. </para>

            <para>- I dare say it would, because the honorable member&#39;s proposal says, &#34; Covenant to fence as prescribed.&#34; If the Board and the Government of the day so decided, it need not be enforced. That is another argument for not inserting an unnecessary clause. I cannot see my way to accept the amendment on any grounds. In the South Australian leases the Government do not guarantee the correctness of the boundaries, but retain the right to correct them when surveys are completed. If the land is not surveyed, why should the Crown be put to the expense of making a heavy survey to delimit the boundaries to be fenced? When the leases are granted they are granted approximately, and are worked out from a given point. Our main endeavour is to attract settlers to the Northern Territory, and this Bill is more likely to achieve that end than if we were to impose harsh improvements conditions since those which arc in operation at present are not working satisfactorily. </para>

In the early days South Australia had a similar provision, and it was in every sense a dead letter, or even worse. Instead of insisting on improvements in the outside country, we should impose stocking conditions, which&#39; would mean that the country would be used. If improvements are insisted upon the successful development of the country will be impossible. I ask the honorable member for the Northern Territory if he will not agree that fencing conditions would be an absolute bar to anybody taking up new leases, and would make it practically impossible for the present holders to continue? </para>

            <para>- Very well. With the advent of a railway there would be a little more reason in it, but in other States which have inside country to develop and where railways have already been provided, it has been found that if improvement conditions had, been enforced the lessees would have been compelled to throw up their holdings. The first requisite is the occupancy and use of the land by stocking. There is no occasion to enforce this exacting condition, which if given effect to would desolate the Territory. </para>

If some of the leases had. to. be fenced, it would involve the expenditure of a sum which even those with ample capital could not afford, and if that is the case, what would be the position of smaller holders with limited capital? They would be starved out, and would have to abandon their leases. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking common sense, and donot intend to commentonthe rubbish spoken concerning the meetings at Scott&#39;s Hotel. Stocking the land means utilizing it, and those who can command a certain amount of capital will, so soon as it is a payable proposition, fence their holdings. If we compelled them to provide such improvements today, it would cost them ten times more than the country is worth. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member said a little while ago that improvement conditions could be enforced if a railway were . constructed. We should first construct a railway, and then talk about fencing. We. shouldnot ask the settlers to do what is practically impossible. The  honorable member could not render a greater disservice to the Northern Territory than to advocate such a provision. The men of limited means, who cannot command the necessary capital, are holding their leases until a railway is constructed. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Will honorable members agree to the inclusion of such a, ridiculous provision in the Bill, which would be the mean&#39;s of seriously retarding development? It will drive men out rather than encourage them. &#34; Fencing as prescribed &#34; may mean not only boundary fences, which would be bad enough, and useless enough in cattle country, but also fencing into paddocks. The more one looks at this amendment the more ridiculous, absurd, and. impossible it becomes. The day will come when sheep will take the place of cattle in the Northern Territory, and honorable members will find then that the men who occupy the land will put the improvements there. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Adelaide is improving wonderfully this session. When I have educated him a little more in the ways of the Never-Never, he will be a most valuable member of the House. When men with capital find that it will pay to improve the land, they will improve it, and they will not do it before. The history of the development of our pastoral areas shows that the greater the improvements, the , greater is the carrying capacity of the land, and, therefore, the greater are the profits. Men who command capital will put sheep on the Territory land, or subdivide it into smaller areas for cattle, as soon as they find that it will be profitable to do so, and they will do it without being asked to do it. Itrust that the Committee, for the sake of its reputation for common sense, will not agree to such a wild and silly amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I am afraid that the Minister in charge of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson),</inline> and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> have entirely missed the point of the argument advanced by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson).</inline> While we may admire the enthusiasm of the honorable member for Wakefield, we cannot help realizing that he fails to visualize the position that may arise if leases are granted without improvement conditions. I strongly support the view submitted by the honorable member for the Northern Territory. The argument is frequently used in this chamber that the construction of railway lines in new country leads to development and closer settlement. We are legislating tonight for the years that are to come. The leases which will be granted under this measure will not expire until 1965. In the meantime the North-South railway  line may be built. Several undertakings that were made at the time of Federation, such as the building of the Federal Capital, and the construction of the East-West railway line, have been, and are being, honored, and it is quite within the bounds of possibility that the next five or ten years may see the completion of the North-South railway line. Honorable members have, therefore, to take cognizance of the position that will then arise respecting the leases which will be granted under the provisions of this Bill. We should provide that the lessees must improve their holdings after the construction of the railway line. </para>

The electorate which I represent should be closely settled. Our experience has been interesting.

            <para>- The sort of &#34; mugs&#34; who support the honorable member. Because of these experiences many complaints are heard to-day about the drift of population from the country to the city. Large areas of land in Australia are not available for the young Australian, and therefore he cannot remain in the country. I defy any honorable member to say that there has not been in every State in Australia a huge expenditure of public money on railways which have been built practically under false pretences. </para>

            <para>- It is essential to make provision for the development of the Northern Territory leasehold lands after the North-South railway line is constructed. That railway line will be built by public money, and - as in the case of the East-West line, which is operated at a loss of about &#163;60,000 every year - the electors all over Australia will have to bear the loss which its working will incur. In those circumstances itis only right that the people who reap the benefits from it shall improve their land. The honorable member for the Northern Territory has not made a revolutionary proposal. Every lease that is granted in New South Wales has attached to it improvement conditions prescribed by the Minister, on the advice of the surveyors. </para>

            <para>- By the time the North-South railway line is built a good deal of development may have occurred in the Northern Territory. Mineral deposits may be discovered, for instance, which will cause land to become very valuable. It is most significant that the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> who journeyed through this country a few weeks ago, has not spoken during this debate. As a member of the Cabinet he cannot oppose his colleagues on the measure, and he is man enough not to stand up and tell deliberate lies to the Committee. If he opened his mouth he would have to support the views expressed by the honorable member for the Northern. Territory. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> had to be brought in to make a speech on this measure the other day, so where is the Minister&#39;s consistency? The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> and myself quoted in this House recently innumerable instances of damage done to the western division of New South Wales, by the &#34;Kidman blight.&#34; Miles of fences in those out-back areas were deliberately torn down because unpatriotic Australian land monopolists refused to pay the wages and to observe working conditions awarded by an independent tribunal. They said, &#34;No longer will we be at the mercy of the Australian Workers Union. We will cut out sheep and run cattle on the land.&#34; The price of cattle has dropped, however, and these gentlemen now come to the Government, cap in hand, to ask for help. We should not barter away the birthright of the people in dealing with the Northern Territory lands. When the railway is built, it will be possible for the Northern Territory leaseholders to make reasonable improvements. Only reasonable improvements would be asked for by any Minister. If we are not careful, we shall find the same state of affairs in the Northern Territory that exists in some of the States. Public money will be spent on gigantic railway projects, and the Jowetts and the Kidmans, through whose land these railways will go, will notbe under any obligation to improve their holdings. </para>

            <para>- No. They have repudiated taxation placed on them by this Parliament; but that, of course, is beside the question. Because some of the leaseholders occupy 10,000 square miles or more of country, the Minister has told us that fencing would be impossible. I must remind him that these men receive enormous profits from their enormous holdings, and that when the railway is constructed it will run through their country for hundreds of miles. </para>

No one could have supported the building of the East-West railway line as a business proposition, but honorable members supported it because an understanding was entered into with the people of Western Australia that it would be built. The same kind of understanding is supposed to exist with the people of South Australia. </para>

            <para>- From the point of view of honorable members representing South Australian constituencies, I suppose everything that is detrimental to the interests of that State is wrong. It is generally accepted, however, that an obligation rests upon this Parliament to Construct the North-South railway line. I donot think, therefore, that we should handicap ourselves in respect to these leases by failing to make provision that they shall be improved after the railway is built. The honorable member for the Northern Territory is not asking for anything unreasonable. He has pointed out that the improvement conditions may be waived until the proper time for their enforcement. I presume that the Minister who will have the administration of this measurewill seek the advice of the Board before attempting to enforce any improvement conditions. We know that all the Governments of Australia have treated the large land-holders very well - much better, in fact, than they have treated the small land-holders. The holders of large areas of land are being treated better in this Bill than the holders of smaller areas. The honorable member for the Northern Territory has rightly pointed out that drastic conditions are proposed  formen who will occupy land for agricultural purposes. They will be obliged to cultivate certain areas, and to construct certain fences. The honorable member for Wakefield made no complaint about that. He is not fighting for the small landholder. </para>

            <para>- Under the paragraph to which the Minister refers, it is provided that leases under the Ordinance shall contain amongst other things - any other reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions which are prescribed, and which are considered by the Board tobe necessary under the circumstances of any particular case. </para>

        <para class="block">But the Minister is not likely to prescribe a condition for a lease which he now says is ridiculous. Unless the provision is specifically included in the Ordinance we cannot expect that the Government will prescribe it. I am confident that the successors of the present Government will, after public money has been expended in the construction of a railway through the Northern Territory, bitterly rue that expenditure if no provision is included in the Ordinance to enable them to force leaseholders in the Territory to improve their leases; and I am speaking as a land-holder possessing the freehold of agricultural and grazing land, which is taxed at the rate of1s. per acre.I venture to say that no other section of land-holders in Australia pays taxation as high as that paid by holders of agricultural and grazing land in the district in which I live. I am not speaking without experience in this matter when I say that what is retarding the progress of country districts in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia, is the fact that men are allowed to hold large areas of land without adequately improving them. Many of these large holders of land will not even build a decent house for their employees to live in. It is most difficult to induce the holders of the largest areas tocarry out improvements. These are held very often by companies whose shareholders are in Great Britain and other parts of the world, and are represented here only by managers. The passing of this measure andthe possibility of the construction of the North-South railway will probably lead to speculation in land in the Northern Territory. Big companies, represented here only by managers, will probably be formed to take up the country. They will put a few stock on the runs, and let them roam at will. They will not bother to fence or otherwise improve the areas they hold. They will carry out only the most meagre improvements, as is done by those holding land in the western district of New South Wales, which is at present suffering from the evil effects of the &#34; Kidman blight.&#34; So long as these people make profits, Australians may starve. The reason the large holders in the western district of New South Wales have changed from the grazing of sheep to the grazing of cattle is because they are disloyal to their own people. They employ only one or two boundary riders, and three or four gins on a station. These are the pioneers, and not the Kidmans and Jowetts and the pastoralists who meet at Scott&#39;s Hotel. These gentlemen are the persons who believe in private enterprise, but yet, on every occasion when they think they can get a little out of the Commonwealth, they come to this Parliament with their hats in their hands. They will not pay the legitimate taxation imposed by this Parliament, and the present Government is assisting them to avoid its payment. We on thisside desire that the birthright of Australians yet unborn shall be preserved for them. I am supporting the amendment because I believe that those who will reap the benefit of immense expenditure upon railway construction in. the Northern Territory later on should be prevented from allowing the country to remain a wilderness during the currency of their leases. If the land is of the quality which the honorable member for the Northern Territory has led us to believe it is, I do not think that holdings in the Northern Territory should be as large as they are&#39;. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member desires to perpetuate that condition of things, and, by opposing a condition for improvements in the leases, would hamper the efforts of any Government in the future to alter it. The amendment is not moved with any view to personal gain, because it is very unlikely that any honorable member on this side will have any interest in the Northern Territory except to legislate for its advancement. We are here, however, as representatives of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, who will be taxed to pay for the construction of a railway through the Territory, and, once leases are granted under this Ordinance, we will have no power to force the lessees to improve their holdings. The railway, when constructed, will go through large areas utilized only for the grazing of cattle, and they will provide but very little revenue for the line. If the Government of the day is in a position to compel lessees to improve their runs to fit them for the grazing of sheep, a much larger revenue can be expected from the line. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> tells us that there is good country there, capable of supporting a great many people on smaller areas than are now held, but the big lessees will hold their country under this Ordinance, and, if any attempt is made later on to vary the terms of their leases to secure the adequate improvement of the runs, they will raise the cry of repudiation. I hope that the Minister will, by accepting the amendment, take the necessary steps now to safeguard the future interests of the people. If the amendment is not acceptable in the form in which it has been submitted, the Minister might draft an amendment which he would consider satisfactory. He could take the power to prescribe from time to time certain area&#39;s which must be &#34; fenced or otherwise suitably improved.&#34; Honorable members should bear in mind that we are dealing with Crown lands, and are contemplating the expenditure of millions in railway construction in the Territory which will greatly improve the value of the lands held by the pastoral lessees. That being so, we should have the right to force those lessees to carry out improvement conditions which will tend to make the railway pay. </para>

            <para>- Then we may grant the honorable member a little knowledge of the subject. He has told us that men with only a little money cannot make improvements on their holdings, and that those who have a great deal of money will make improvements when they believe they are needed. I challenge the honorable member to say whether it is not a fact that Tom Butterfield, the present member for Newcastle in the South Australian House of Assembly, who, I presume, does know something about the northern areas of South Australia, moved for a Royal Commission last year to go into the question of the non-compliance by lessees in that part of South Australia with the conditions of their leases. He complained of their neglect to keep improvements made with the taxpayers&#39; money in a proper state of repair. </para>

            <para>- That is so. The honorable member for Gwydir reminded us that the railway would be built before the present leases mature. An immense sum of public money must be expended on that undertaking, so it is desirable that the lessees should be required to do something, in view of the added facilities for profit-making which will have been furnished at the public&#39;s expense, to conserve the interests of the general taxpayer. It is only a reasonable safeguard, and one which, I am sure, the honorable member for Wakefield would provide in the case of his own business. But the railway has not yet materialized. Why has not the honorable member for Wakefield displayed more energy in this matter, seeing that he represented part of the Northern Territory in the South Australian Parliament for many years, and has been in this Parliament ever since he was turned down in his own State ? </para>

            <para>- I want to see more of this tooth-and-hail fighting on the part of the honorable member. I am afraid he cannot scratch very deeply, or he would have moved something before now. More Ministers for Home and Territories and Works and Railways have come from South Australia than from any other State, yet we have not got what Western Australia secured within a few years, simply because that State was represented by a man who fought tenaciously for its interests.He played the &#34; Pear&#39;s Soap &#34; trick in this Parliament, and got what he wanted. As a representative of a metropolitan area., I want this Parliament to realize its responsibility, and build the North-South railway, not because I have anything to gain personally, but because I think it is about time we began this big national undertaking. If I were in the position of the honorable member for Wakefield, I would be asking this Government, in season and out of season, why the railway was not being built. When the Government policy was brought down without any reference to this national undertaking, I suggested that the honorable member for Wakefield should move, and the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. M. Cameron)</inline> should second, the Address-in-Reply, in order to be able to twit the Government with not having recognized their obligation to South Australia in respect of the NorthSouth line. </para>

I can assure the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> that, as a supporter of the next Labour Government, I shall not fall down on the job in urging the Government to bisect Australia with a railway running north and south. Turning to the amendment, it is, I submit, right that the lessees should be obliged to do as suggested. It will not hamper the Government in their dealings with the pastoral lessees of the Northern Territory. Surely the Government are entitled to prescribe the manner in which leaseholds shall be fenced ? With regard to land held under agricultural leases, there is no hesitancy on the part of the Government. .

            <para>- I do not know, but I am optimistic enough to think that the members of the Board, as common-sense men, will hot impose unreasonable provisions upon the holders of agricultural leases, or do anything to drive people off the land. The provisions of clause 68 will not frighten prospective &#39; leaseholders, especially if they have reason to believe that the North-South railway will be constructed. We have spent many thousands of pounds on developmental railways, but, unfortunately, in many cases, land for miles along railway lines is being held but of use. Consequently, those railways are losing propositions. Unhappily, owing to the conditions under which the land is held there is no power to resume it, except by paying exorbitant prices. The experience of the Queensland Government has demonstrated that we cannot get money from London unless we &#39; &#39; come to heel &#34; in regard to the conditions under which pastoral areas are held under leases made many years ago. Notwithstanding what may be done to develop the Northern Territory, even this Bill provides that any re-appraisement of leasehold values must not exceed the rentals paid prior to the re-appraisement by more than 50 per cent. We are assured by honorable members supporting the Government that the lessees would not remain on their holdings unless these concessions were granted. </para>

            <para>- That is a question I will answer without notice when I become a Minister. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> requires a covenant by the lessee that he will observe and comply with the regulations under the Ordinance. Those are the restrictions placed on the agrarians. The Government do not mind putting the iron heel on the poor &#34; cocky,&#34; but for the <inline font-style="italic">habitues</inline> of Scott&#39;s Hotel the straw must be put in the drink every time. The amendment is not asking for more than ought to be done. The Minister should not oppose the honorable member representing the Northern Territory, who has seen the country and knows the leases there and the opportunities there are for extension of settlement. Last week&#39; the House listened attentively to the honorable member for Bass, advancing reasons for building a railway through the Territory, and I think every honorable member acquiesced in the conclusion that he had made out a good case on the knowledge he  had gained through one trip through the country about which he was speaking. As a matter of fact, honorable members generally were prepared to accept his advice, but here we have the Minister opposing the advice of a man who has spent his life in the Territory, who knows the land about which he is talking, and who indicates what he in his wisdom thinks will bring about that development we all hope to see in the Territory in the future. The Minister really could not put up any argument to the contrary, and the honorable member for Wakefield, who attempted to do so, merely spoke in broad generalities, saying that the &#34; shy bird &#34; would take flight. I once read that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook made the remark that we must be careful of that shy bird, the capitalist, or else he would fly away from our shores, yet almost immediately afterwards we found capitalists standing on chairs to get in through the windows of the offices of the Metropolitan Board of </para>

          <para>.- We have had a long, earnest, and, at times, eloquent discussion upon the rights and wrongs of this Bill, but I want to know whether it is a measure that cannot be altered except by the deliberate&#39; act of this Parliament, or whether it is merely an Ordinance subject to alteration at any time at the will of the Minister. The Northern Territory is now governed by Ordinances. </para>

            <para>- No Minister can break the spirit or the letter of an Act of Parliament, but an Ordinance can be amended, added to, or repealed by Ordinances made under the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910. Therefore, whatever this House may decide, if the Minister in his judgment determines to issue an Ordinance to the contrary it can be done in the usual way by laying the amending Ordinance on the table of the House for the prescribed time, after which it becomes operative, unless, in the meantime, objection is taken by a majority of the  House. </para>

            <para>- I was asking for information. I was anxious to know whether we were considering a measure that could only be altered by the deliberate act of this Parliament, or whether it was merely an Ordinance that could be altered by the Minister in the usual way in which Ordinances are issued. If the Minister can, on the recommendation of his officers, or for any other reason, alter any of the provisions of this measure by issuing an Ordinance and laying it on the table of the House for the prescribed time, we are now, to a large extent, beating the air. The Minister now assures me that this will not be an Act, but that it will be issued as an Ordinance which may be amended, added to, or repealed by Ordinances made under the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, so that whatever amendments we pass, or whatever discussions we may nave, will go by the board if, in the opinion of the Minister and his officers, it is necessary to amend anything we agree to now. </para>

            <para>- On other occasions honorable members have raised objections to Ordinances laid on the table. I do not know that the House has actually disallowed those Ordinances, but honorable members have had the opportunity to deal with them. The unfortunate position, at present, is that this Ordinance was lying on the table of the House, and no one took objection to it until practically the last day before that on which it would automatically become law, and then the honorable member for the Northern Territory was given the opportunity to discuss it. I think that the Government has acted very fairly, for it has given an opportunity to all members to discuss the whole matter. It was made clear that when the terms of the measure had been settled it would be embodied in an Ordinance and promulgated in the usual way. </para>

          <para>.- I intend only to deal with salient facts, and not with rambling statements that have nothing whatever to do with the Territory. The Minister was quite in error in saying that Territories are always governed by Ordinances. If he looks at the schedule to the Bill he will see a reference to the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act, which South Australia passed in 1890, and a number of amending Acts. A territory extending over half a million square miles is too great to be governed by means of Ordinances, which are laid on the table of the House for a given period, and which, if not disallowed, then became law. There should be a Land Act for an enormous area like the Northern Territory, so that people may become accustomed to the conditions of land tenure. South Australia has had a Crown Lands Act for the Territory for the last 50 years. </para>

        <para>Mr.FOSTER. - People made a great stir because they did not know what the Ordinance, as originally introduced, provided. When they asked to see the Ordinance, it was found that only three copies existed. I managed to secure one of these, and took it to South Australia. A great deal has been said by way of criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman. As the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> interjected, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> has spent an immense sum of money on the country held by him, and, but for that fact, he would not have made money out of wool. The greater part of his land was taken over from men who walked out bankrupt. He did not pay a penny for improvements which had been insisted on by a Government that subsequently enforced stocking conditions instead of improvements. What led to the ruin of those land-holders was, in the first place&#39;, the low price of wool, and then the rabbit and wild-dog pests. It will require the expenditure of a fortune to bring such holding&#39;s back to a productive condition. The Government cannot put up the improvements, but, it will have to help finance the land-holders. </para>

            <para>- It will be impossible to erect fences until railway facilities are provided. I hope that honorable members opposite will be reasonable, and realize that we cannot have closer settlement and small land-holders in the Territory until big men havegone well into the interior and have spent half, a lifetime in blazing the track. Reference has been made to the visit of the Minister for Works and Railways to the Macdonnell Ranges, but we need have no misgivings concerning that country. There will be no occasion for 42 years&#39; leases in that district, for it is blessed with the finest climate imaginable, and has an annual rainfall of from 10 to 22 inches. It is the sanatorium of the Territory, and Will make &#39;the development&#34; of that portion of Australia further north certain.

            <para>- They had to ask Parliament to grant them a bonus on the export of beef. We voted for that bounty. I shall not be prepared to vote for such a bonus again this year. The whole of the country in Western Australia north of the Tropic ofCapricorn is held by  6,000  people, because the pastoralists there have devoted their energies solely to cattle-raising.I admit that there is a difficulty in raising sheep in the Kimberleys - which is different country from the Barkly Tableland - because the grass seeds make it impossible to run sheep there. It is our duty to see that the Northern Territory is put to its best possible use, and that involves the running of sheep. If we allow pastoralists to hold land for  42  years without any obligation to fence it, they willcontinue to do as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman and others have done - simply stock vast areas with cattle, and have the stations worked by a few blackfellows under the direction of one or two white men. Apart from the problem of settlement, we have to consider the question of defence. The only way to defend our northern shores&#34; is to have a large white populationthere. We have been told that twelvemen in the Northern Territory hold an area of 90,000  square miles, which is larger than Victoria. In Western Australia  24  men have between them an area representing  1,000,000  acres each, and it is by no means the least rich portion of the State. On that basis,  55  men would control an area equal to the whole of Victoria. We should be lacking in our duty to posterity if we did not protest against these huge tracts of country being held by men who do not put the land, to its best use. Neglect to erect fences and make other provision for carrying sheep is not a policy that will commend itself to the people, and if, when the railway has been built, &#39; the -lessees arenot prepared to do something., to stock the land with sheep, </para>

        <para class="block">I do not think any honorable member will be justified in voting to allow those men to retain their vast holdings. It may be true, as the Ministor has said, that population is leaving the Northern Territory; but, on the other hand&#39;, land grabbing is increasing from year to year, as these figures prove : In  191 7, 103,000,000  acres was held under pastoral . lease; in  1918, 114,000,000  acres; in  1919, 117,000,000  acres; in  1920, 133,000,000  acres; and in  1921, 136,000,000  acres - an increase of  33  per cent. in four years. Do not honorable members realize that if we do not insist upon the land being put to its best possible use, this land grabbing will continue to increase, and no genuine settlement will be possible? I am not opposed to the pastoralists. I recognize that they pioneer remote areas, but this &#39;Parliament has a sacred trust - one might almost say, a trust reposed in it by Providence - to develop the  500,000  square miles of country in the Northern Territory. It is our duty to insist that instead of the laud being monopolized by a few men, who make little use of it, it shall be developed to its utmost capacity. </para>

            <para>- These new conditions can only apply to leases that are brought under this Ordinance. Thebest land is supposed to he held under the South Australian Acts, and the lessees who hold it will not come under this Ordinance unless they elect to do so. We aretryingto get sheep on the land by methodsother than those which the honorable member proposes. </para>

            <para>- The methods that the Minister is proposing are similar to those which have failed in the past, except that, in addition, a railway is to be built, at vast expense to the people of the Commonwealth! This Parliament should see that the people get a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for such expenditure, by insisting that the men who hold the land shall do something to improve and settle it. </para>

          <para>.- If we desire to induce people to settle in the Northern Territory wo should notburden the leases with irksome conditions.Ifa  man intends to raise sheep he will be obliged to fence his land; no legislative compulsion will be necessary. Another man may engage in the raising of cattle, and they will be kept within his boundaries by water supplies. It would he infinitely better to allow the settlers to expend their money on the provision of water for cattle than to compel them to waste their substance in fencing the land, where fences are unnecessary. The lessees will fence when they find it necessary, but to compel them to do so would retard settlement. </para>
