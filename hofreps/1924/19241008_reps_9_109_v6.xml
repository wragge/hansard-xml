                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs is it a fact that his Department has registered a decision that boxes made of Queensland pine, when used for packing butter, must in future be lined with paraffin wax. If Queensland pine, which is now being used, is regarded as beyond doubt unsuitable for butter boxes, will the Minister instruct the Institute of Science and Industry to make inquiries as to whether any of the numerous soft woods of Australia are suitable for the purpose? I should like to point out that the boxes which are now being used are lined with paper, and for many years have been used in the export of Queensland butter, which frequently has brought the highest price on the London market. </para>

                        <para>- The fullest consideration has not yet been given to the position of the textile industry, but I believe that some considerable relief will be experienced as a result of the alteration in the proportion of British manufacture required to secure preference under the tariff for British imports. A good deal of competition has been experienced by the textile industry from so-called British goods which were made of continental materials. That competition will be met by the alteration referred to. During the recess I propose to devote a considerable amount of attention to the position of the textile industry. </para>

                        <para>- The words &#34;suitably transferred&#34; mean &#34;transferred to a position of similar status and salary to that now held by the officer.&#34; All officers of the Commonwealth Public Service are at the present time subject to transfer to a branch of the Commonwealth Public Service in another state, and it is, therefore, not desirable to promise that all Victorian officers of the Taxation Branch will be absorbed within Victoria. As far as practicable, however, Victorian officers will be absorbed within Victoria. </para>

                <para class="block">To understand the effect of my amendment, it is necessary, to refer to section 20 of the principal act, under which the Public Service Board is given certain powers with regard to excess officers. My amendment is intended to meet a situation under which injustice has been suffered, and may continue to be suffered, by members of the Public Service. There can be no doubt that, as a result of the reclassification, a great number of officers will be regarded as excess officers, and there may be some difficulty in transferring them to other positions in the Service. Under section 20 of the principal act the Public Service Board has the power to transfer an excess officer from one department to another, or to dismiss him from the Service without compensation. The amendment I submit, if accepted, will have the effect that a person regarded as an excess officer will have his name placed on what is known as the unattached list for twelve months, and will be eligible for appointment to any vacancy in the Service that may occur during that period. He will not be suspended or dismissed from the Public Service until a reasonable opportunity is afforded to place him in some other position in his own or some other department. I ask the Prime Minister to recognize the merit of the claim for this consideration which is made by members of the Public Service, and I trust that the committee will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> is to provide that excess officers for whom a suitable position is not available shall not be reduced in status or retrenched for a period of twelve months, and that during that period they shall be entitled to draw the salaries they were receiving when declared to be excess officers. The Government cannot accept the amendment. A public servant is declared to be an excess officer only after the fullest inquiries have been made by the board, and it is only when a position of similar or lower status is not available that public servants will be retired. It would be absurd to allow officers to remain in the Service and draw their salaries for twelve months after they had been declared to be excess officers. The amendment is contradictory of that provision of the Public </para>

                        <para>- Vacancies in departments are continually being caused by death, retirement, invalidity,, and for a number of other reasons. For instance, many ex-taxation officers are now carrying on lucrative businesses in advising taxpayers how to prepare their returns. The Prime Minister, perhaps quite unintentionally, endeavoured to make the committee believe that if the amendment were adopted a number of excess officers would be drawing their salaries for twelve months while not performing any useful work. If the services of a clerical officer in the Postal Department were no longer required, it should be an easy matter to place him in another department where a vacancy existed. The Public Service Board ought to be very careful before dispensing with the services of well-trained men. </para>

                        <para>- I have known contractors retain the services of their best men for several months. When retrenchments are necessary the heads of departments are asked to select the men whose services can be dispensed with ; and I have known of men in permanent positions being discharged one day and being engaged as temporary employees in the same department on the following day to undertake the work they were performing as permanent hands. It is suggested that excess officers should be placed on an unattached list for twelve months to enable the Public Service Board to make the fullest possible inquiries as to the positions available before officers are reduced in status or are retired. Provision is made for the retirement of public servants notwithstanding the fact that many vacancies may occur immediately after officers have been retrenched. Section 20 suggests that public servants do not hold permanent positions, as is generally supposed, as the board has the right to dispense with the services of any public officer under its control. Sometimes the work in one department is slack, but in other departments there is increased activity, necessitating the employment of a larger staff. In such cases, transfers could easily be made without imposing any injustice upon public servants. I have heard heads of departments say that after permanent officers have been dismissed they have been compelled to engage temporary hands, whose training necessarily involves a loss of time and money. I trust the committee will accept the amendment and thus protect excess officers whilst the board is endeavouring to place them in another department. </para>

                    <para>. - When this matter was discussed at an informal conference of some members of this party with the Prime Minister, I was under the impression that the board was agreeable to an amendment to prevent officers from being placed at a disadvantage. It was thought that the period of twelve months suggested by the Public Service Clerical Association was too long to be seriously considered. I certainly was under the impression that he was agreeable to a provision being inserted whereby redundant officers would be given some consideration. A term of three months was suggested as being fair, and I fully expected that the Government would submit an amendment to that effect, thus enabling officers whose services had been dispensed with an opportunity to obtain another position without being subjected to rigid monetary loss. A period of three months would give the board sufficient time to ascertain if an officer could be employed in another department, and if he could not be so employed, the payment of his salary for three months could be regarded as compensation for the period during which he would be likely to be out of employment. I am surprised that provision to this effect is not made in the bill, or, alternatively, he might be given three months&#39; notice of termination of his services to enable him to seek another position. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government proposes to alter the section by inserting the words &#34; of a particular classification.&#34; That will narrow the possibility of public servants being placed elsewhere by the board. If we had a big industrial depression in Australia, the business of the Post Office, as well as of other government departments, would decline, and if the excess officers were placed elsewhere for twelve months there would be no difficulty, at the end of that period, in absorbing them, for all our departments are, over a period of years, expanding. If the Government and the Public Service Board oppose the amendment there can be only one explanation of their opposition. They must have in view the marking of certain men as excess employees. The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> has suggested a period of three months, and has sought to give it the colour of compensation. The public servant does not want compensation, he wants his job. If an excess officer was transferred, without restriction, to another position, he could eventually be absorbed. If it is intended to mark certain men, why not be honest about it? If the services of an employee are not required, a charge should be laid against him. </para>

A man goes into the Public Service at a low salary with a view to making it his life&#39;s work. The Public Service to-day is not sufficiently attractive to induce any honorable member, for instance, to place his son in it, and we ought not to make it worse. While we do not desire to make the Public Service a coddling-ground for men in easy jobs, those who have made themselves efficient in a class of work that would be no good to them outside the Service should be given reasonable security of tenure for as long as they do their jobs satisfactorily. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government would be well advised not to persist in the amendment of the section. The inducement held out to smart young men to devote their lives to the Public Service has been the permanency of the appointment. Although permanency has never been laid down as a legal right, it has not previously been suggested that an officer could be dismissed as redundant without being paid compensation. Whenever the Government has dispensed with the services of men, except for misconduct, it has compensated them. The honorable member for Lang interjected that men might be redundant. I remind honorable members of the treatment meted out to the &#34; brass hats &#34; who were found to be redundant in the Defence Department. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but the fact is now being emphasized that there is no provision for compensation. What has been the experience of the last twelve or eighteen months? Men in the Defence Department were alleged to be redundant, and after they had been compensated, they were taken back into the Service. That was done with some of the officers from Duntroon, the training of whom cost &#163;5,000 each. When they had completed their training they were compensated by being given six months&#39; pay,  and some of them were subsequently taken into the service of the department. It would be very much better if the position of public servants was made permanent, subject only to their good behaviour and efficiency.Ifthatwere done it would make for a contented Public Service. I do not suggest that public servants should be allowed to do as they like, or that no discretionary power should be given to the head of a department to dispense with men who do not do their work. That would lead to chaos. As the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> has pointed out, public servants are in a class by themselves. A man employed in the commercial world can go from one employer to another, but men in the Public Service have only one employer, and while, as years pass by, they become more expert in their particular departments, they also become less efficient for the battle in the outside world. A sense of security ought to be given to them, even if it has not been given in the past. I support the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and suggest that if, as a result of the reclassification it is declared that certain departments have redundant officers, the junior officers should be the only ones affeeted, for they could be transferred to another department, and eventually absorbed much more easily than senior officers. If third class officers are declared to be in excess it will be very difficult to find other positions for them. Some guarantee should be given that if officers are declared to be redundant they will be treated at least as justly as we have treated the military officers who were retired. I do not ask that they shall be treated as generously as those officers that received nineteen months&#39; full pay, because they retired seven months before the retiring age. Some of them received three times as much for leaving the Service as they would have received if they had worked until their retiring age. The same privileges should be given to the humblest man in the Service as are given to military officers generally. </para>

                    <para>. - I suggest that the Prime Minister should give an assurance that the name of an employee declared to be redundant will be placed on a list and that he will be appointed to the first vacancy available. That would remove most of the hardships. There is a danger that the head of a department may declare an employee redundant for no other reason than that he is personally biased against him, or to enable him to be placed in another position in authority over other men. If a man is to receive twelve months&#39; . compensation he will not unnecessarily be declared redundant. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised that the Prime Minister has not accepted the reasonable proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> I should like the Prime Minister to make clear the effect of the words &#34; of a particular classification.&#34; If those words are inserted in section 20, it is clear that it will restrict the field for re-employment which will be available to officers who are declared to be excess officers. Take the case of a postmaster in a certain division. If he is declared to be an excess officer, and there is at the time no position of postmaster available, his services will be dispensed with. The number of vacancies for postmasters at any time is limited. I hope that the Prime Minister will explain the reasons for the insertion of the words desired. It is all very well for him to say that every effort will be made to place men elsewhere, but the insertion of the words proposed to be inserted will restrict their chances of finding employment in other departments, and in many cases will mean that their services will be dispensed with. I have in mind the speeches of the present Treasurer when, as a private member, he sat in the corner, and spoke of what he termed the &#34; great army of public servants &#34; in this country. </para>

                        <para>- In this matter, at least, the Treasurer&#39;s influence appears to be predominant in the Government. This is a devious method of dismissing a number of men from the Public Service, which, to say the least, is not creditable to the Government. No decent business firm would treat its employees in this manner. When business  is slack, private employers usually endeavour to retain the services of employees who have given satisfaction, until such time as things brighten, and remunerative work is again available. This Government claims to stand for economy, but instead of saving money, this action will have the opposite effect. The proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> should be adopted, and officers who are declared to be in excess should be placed on the &#34; unattached list &#34; for a definite period. While, to-day, there may be no position to which they can be appointed, to-morrow a vacancy may occur. The action of the Government will make the -Public Service of the Commonwealth less attractive to the youth of this country, and will result in a lessening of efficiency, which is not at all desirable. Men who have given their best years in the service of the country will find that, at the whim of a board, which was established mainly to reduce the number of public servants and their rates of pay, they are thrown out of employment. The Government does not care to what extent the lower paid officers of the Public Service are affected, but when it is a case of those on the top rungs of the ladder, it nurses and protects them in every way. I think that this is the first time in the history of Australia that an attempt of this kind has been made. Honorable members&#39; will understand the position if they will place themselves in the position of the public servants, who entered the Service in the belief that they would receive permanent employment, but now find- that, after having given the best years of their life to that Service, they are faced with unemployment. </para>

In his customary off-hand manner the Prime Minister says that there will be no departure from the old method. If that is so, pie should accept the amendment, in order to make assurance doubly sure. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A.

I hope that the Prime Minister will explain the reasons for the insertion of these words, and provide the necessary safeguards. </para>

                        <para>- I listened carefully to what the honorable member said, and I think that he conveyed to the committee the same impression that his remarks made upon me. Under the existing act, excess officers can be dealt with. Such officers may either be transferred to other positions of lower status and salary, or, if no such positions are available, their services may be dispensed with. That has&#39; been the position all along. Section 20 of the act now in operation reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That the Government proposes to amend by inserting after the word &#34; officers &#34; the words &#34; of  a  particular classification.&#34; The present act clearly contemplates that action must be taken with regard to any officers who may be declared to be in excess; and I think that honorable members generally will agree that that is necessary.  While  we are all desirous of giving fair and equitable treatment  to  the members of the Public Service,  no  one would countenance for  a  moment the retention of persons in employment,  at  the expense of the taxpayers, for whom there was nothing  to do.  When Parliament legislated for excess officers, it meant that legislation  to  work out in practice. But let us consider the position  of  the </para>
                <para class="block">Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, with its thousands of employees, under the existing legislation. Let us suppose that one postmaster in excess of requirements is found, but that there is no position of &#34; postmaster &#34; vacant, although other positions in the department are available. In those circumstances the board has no power to remove that postmaster to another position unless it can establish that, throughout the whole of the department, including the linesmen, telegraphists, telephonists, and so on, there is an excess number of officers. Honorable members will agree that that absolutely nullifies the section and defeats the intention of Parliament. If, however, the words &#34;of a particular classification &#34; are inserted, and it is found that there are more postmasters of a certain status than positions of the same status, the board will have power to transfer the excess officers to other positions. Of course, if no positions are available, their services will be dispensed with, as at present. Unless Parliament is prepared to say that, in no circumstances, will it agree that excess officers shall be transferred, or their services dispensed with, the clause should be accepted. I now come to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> The honorable member suggested that an officer who was declared to be in excess should continue to draw his pay for a period of twelve months. If we are to be true custodians of the taxpayers&#39; money, that cannot be permitted. I point out that only under the most exceptional circumstances will officers be declared to be in excess. This is not a provision dealing with a general reclassification of the whole of the Public Service, as has been suggested. The Government&#39;s amendment will apply only to cases such as I have indicated, in which postmasters or other officers in particular branches are found to be excess. The suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> is a reasonable one. The board will only take the drastic action of dispensing with the services of an officer when all means of finding another position for him have been exhausted; but I am sure that there will be no objection to a list being kept of officers whose services have been dispensed with, so that, as far as possible, preference may be given to them in the filling of subsequent vacancies. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister instanced the case of postmasters, but I point out that there are other branches of the service to which the clause might apply. For instance, take the telegraphic branch. Machine telegraphy is used to a much greater extent now than previously, and fewer telegraphists are required. </para>

                        <para>- As machine telegraphy is more generally adopted, this class of public servant will suffer. I hope that the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh will be accepted. It is only reasonable to keep a list of excess officers for twelve months with a view to absorbing them in other branches. Even in private employment men especially qualified for certain work are often kept in their positions for twelve or eighteen months when work is scarce, in order that their services may not be lost to their employers. A man who has devoted many years to telegraphic work is well qualified to fill a position as a clerk, and I am afraid in the next couple of years scores of telegraphists may be thrown out of employment. The proposal of the Government is not brought down for the purpose of assisting the employees, but is intended to give the board additional power in dealing with excess officers, so that if suitable work is not available for them in their particular class they can be dismissed from the service. If the head of a department or a chief officer had a grudge against any particular employee there would be no difficulty, under the clause, in getting rid of him. If they are considered surplus officers in one particular class it will not be incumbent upon the board to find them employment in another branch, but under the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh it would be highly probable within twelve months to absorb them in other branches of the service. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Prime Minister. There are not a great many postmasters in Western Australia, and if a job as a postmaster were not available to an officer of that class he would be immediately put off ; but under the act as it stands such an officer could be given a position as a clerk of the same status or as a postal inspeotor. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> has misunderstood the clause. The effect of the law will not be altered by the addition of the words &#34; of a particular classification.&#34; The power to remove an officer from the Service has always existed. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> mentioned only the case of postmasters, but they are probably the least likely class to be retrenched. Post-offices are increasing, and postal business is growing. The Government&#39;s proposal will merely give the board power to declare that there are excess officers in a certain branch, whereas previously it could only say that there were excess officers in the whole department. For instance, if it were found that a caretaker was no longer required in a particular branch the position could be declared excess, but the board would still have power to transfer the caretaker to some other branch. I do not know of any officers who have been dismissed as the result of re-arrangements. Other positions have always been found for them. Even under the latest retrenchment scheme, which affected some of the high officers in the Taxation Department, the Government instructed the board that no other positions in the Service were to be filled until those officers had been absorbed. </para>

The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> is afraid that the introduction of machine telegraphy will result in telegraphists being thrown out of employment. For the last twenty-five years, we have been told that this system was coming into general use, but for the greater part of the business I maintain that the hand system of telegraphy will never be displaced. </para>

It is one thing to argue whether or not this proposed amendment of section 20 is justifiable, and another to argue as to its effect. Dealing with its effect, the Prime Minister has made it clear that the object is to narrow down the class within which appointments may be made in the case of excess officers. </para>

                        <para>- He did. The clause refers to excess officers of a particular classification. The Prime Minister has been good enough to point out that, prior to the amendment now proposed, the law was that, if at any time the board found  that a greater number of officers was employed in any department or branch than were necessary for the efficient working of that department or branch, the officers in excess could be transferred to other positions of equal classification and salary. The right honorable gentleman also went on to argue that that involved a very wide inquiry throughout the whole of the department to discover whether there were any positions to which the excess officers concerned could be appointed. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment limits the franchise to a particular classification. This is what the Prime Minister .attempted to justify in his speech. He said that, at present, the inquiry was too wide; and he instanced linesmen and other classes of employees in the Postal Department, arguing that, because it would be necessary to search meticulously throughout the whole of the department, it might be practically impossible to declare an officer in excess. Under the clause, the inquiry will be limited to a particular classification. There are two aspects from which the clause may be viewed : One concerns its effect, and the other whether it is just or proper. It seems to me perfectly clear that the proposed amendment of section 20 will facilitate a declaration of excess officers, and provide ultimately for their retirement from the Service. It might be argued that this is perfectly justifiable. I do not say that it is. I take the view, so well expressed by other honorable gentlemen on this side of the committee. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been truly said that under the Public Service Act the board has always had authority to dispense with the services of excess officers. I go further and say that the decision of the High Court has laid down the general principle that there is power inherent in the Sovereign to dispense with the services of any member of the Public Service. Therefore we are not arguing whether the board has power to dispense with excess officers. In the first place, we are arguing as to the effect of the clause, and in the second place, we. say that this power should be exercised, if at all, consistently with the spirit of the Public Service Act, and with the terms upon which public servants are employed. &#34;We may assume that the great majority of them receive appointment as youths, and after examination; that they have been appointed to permanent positions and as permanent employees are- removed from the outside labour market. Higher officials, such as the occupants of judicial positions, are appointed during good behaviour in the terms of the well known Latin phrase - <inline font-style="italic">quamdiu</inline><inline font-style="italic">se bene</inline><inline font-style="italic">gesserit.</inline> It is unlikely, if the Public Service were fairly administered, that under section 20 unamended there would be any excess officers for the reason, so well expressed by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> that with the growth of the Commonwealth Service there must necessarily be ample opportunities to place any officer declared to be excess in his department. The amending clause invests the board with a very dangerous power, which probably will be, and certainly could be exercised, not directly to remove excess officers, but for ulterior reasons. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> wishes to mitigate the hardships that may be imposed on members of the Public Service by the clause. He might have carried his proposal further. I agree with, those who think that if officers of the Public Service are to be retired, there should be some fairly liberal scheme of compensation provided for them. . They are entitled to consideration. I do not think there is any doubt that the effect of the clause will be to facilitate the retirement of excess officers from the Public Service, and to a certain extent it will encourage the board to retire such excess officers. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime &#39;Minister did not represent the position fairly. I have never denied that the board has always had legal power to dispense with the services of excess officers. I dealt with the effect rather than the legal aspect of the clause and showed that it affected the permanency of positions held by members of the Public Service. The right honorable gentleman, supported by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> said that the clause would not narrow the choice in the case of re-appointments. I dispute that. The bill has been specially designed to narrow the excess officers to a particular classification. I admit that the Prime Minister was quite right when he said that re-appointments could be made to any branch of the Public Service, but what is the use of that concession to excess officers who have reached the top of their classification? Under the law as it stood when the number of officers were declared in excess, all the officers in the department went down until the junior officers were reached. Junior officers can be easily placed, because juniors are always &#34;wanted somewhere. But under section 20, as amended by this  clause, there will be a limitation of choice in re-appointments. The board will be able to pick out any individual position, and declare it to be excess. The effect of the Act was- practically to make positions permanent, and to establish a feeling of security, because there were really no excess members in the Public Service. Under the Government&#39;s proposal, certain positions in the Public Service will be declared excess. The appointments of men who have spent a life-time in the Service, will thus be rendered insecure, and this will cause great discontent. The Prime Minister has stated that there is to be no change. That is legally so, but, in effect, there will be a drastic change, affecting the permanency of positions, which &#34; is likely to hit hardest the man who has spent a life-time in the Service. I hope the committee will carry the amendment, but, if it does not, I shall vote against the clause.. </para>

                    <para>, - I shall quote certain figures from the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s report for  the year 1921-2, presented to Parliament on the 13th June, 1923, to show that there is no real necessity for this  clause. I believe that a later report is in print, but is not yet available to honorable members: I find that the total number of officers retired from the Service for various reasons in 1921-22 was 1,315. </para>

                <para class="block">This means that officers who are compulsorily retired by the board, for whom positions have not been found, will receive similar treatment to that meted out to officers recently retrenched. The Government applied the principle of compensation to the officers of the Taxation Department who were retired. A mau who adopts the Civil Service as a career and is subsequently dismissed through unforeseen circumstances, should be compensated, for after spending from ten to twenty years in the service his position is pitiable, from an economic stand-point, if he is then thrown on the labour market and obliged to compete with ordinary workers for employment. It has been the invariable practice of State Government&#39;s, as well as of the Commonwealth Government, in recent times to compensate public servants who are compulsorily retired. As the clause stands, the board has power to dismiss excess officers if it is unable to find a suitable vacancy for them. I object to that summary treatment, on humanitarian grounds, and trust that honorable members will extend to all public servants who are compulsorily retired the same consideration as they gave to the retired officers of the Taxation Department. </para>

                    <para>. - This proposal is quite outside the scope of the bill, and also against the intentions of the Government. It really provides for the application of the principle of compensation to the Public Ser vice, and might involve many and wide issues. The Government is not prepared to consider it in a machinery hill of this description, for it would make a fundamental alteration in . Public Service methods. It is questionable whether the amendment is in order, for it might involve increased taxation. </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the point. An amendment to the bill which would increase taxation would be invalid, and if it were insisted upon the measure would have to be re-introduced in this chamber and in the ordinary way in which taxation bills are introduced. I am not objecting to the amendment on a point of order, however, but on the definite ground that the Government is not prepared to accept it, for it would practically revolutionize the practice of the Service. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. I do not think it goes far enough, for even if it were accepted the board might get over it by offering an officer who was retired from a 3rd class a position at the minimum salary in the 5th class. That should be prevented. It is true that the amendment widens the scope of the bill, but, in my opinion, it is only fair to do so. Grave injustice will be done to men who are compulsorily retired from the Service without adequate compensation, for they had a right to expect, after passing the necessary entrance examinations and generally qualifying themselves for the work, that their positions would be permanent. Officers who have been retired from the Defence and Taxation Departments on the ground that they were excess have been compensated. I- dispute that the officers retired from the Taxation Department were excess and suggest that had they been retained to form the nucleus of a default branch in the Income and Land Taxation Departments, they would have earned their salaries 100 times over by bringing to book defaulting taxpayers. The opportunities for outside employment available to dismissed public servants are very limited.&#39; That is an additional reason for giving them every possible consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment is based on a sound principle. If public servants are declared to be excess, and are dismissed, they have as much right to compensation as the officers of the .Taxation and Defence Departments who were dismissed. The Prime Minister stated that he thought very few officers would be dismissed, and that there would be only a limited number, if any, cases of hardship. If that is so, the cost involved in the acceptance of the  amendment  would be negligible. Public servants who have been in receipt of salaries ranging from &#163;200 <inline font-style="italic">to,</inline> say, &#163;300 per annum could not possibly save sufficient from their income to tide them over a period of unemployment. It takes all their money to maintain themselves and their families from week <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> week. If they are dismissed, they will undoubtedly have a very unhappy experience, for they will be obliged to compete in the labour market with men who have had a commercial training; and, failing there) they will have to accept manual work against men who have been doing unskilled work all their lives, and are thus much Better fitted for it than public servants can be, or else they will have to compete for clerical work or employment in shops and factories against workers who have been trained in the ordinary business houses of our cities. </para>

If the Government intends to make a special effort to find employment for officers who are declared to be excess, it need not fear that very great expense will be involved in the acceptance of the amendment. I support the amendment, for the reason that I believe that these officers are entitled to compensation just as much as the retired Taxation and Defence Department officers. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause deals with the constitution of a so-called Appeal Board, to which members of the Public Service- who are dissatisfied may appeal, but it appears to me to be rather a misnomer to call this an Appeal Board. If honorable members look at the proposed -new subsection 3o they will find that the final determination of the appeal will rest with the Public Service Board itself. It is merely make-believe to call this an Appeal Board from which dissatisfied public servants may seek the redress of their wrongs. It is not likely that, unless very weighty evidence is placed before the Public Service Board, it will agree to alter a -determination - that it has previously made. The justice of any claim will not weigh very greatly with that board. It is most important that there should be an Appeal Board from which public servants can expect scrupulous justice. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that, in a few cases, that may be done. It may be contended that there will be no collusion between the representatives of the board and the permanent head of the department, but I think that it is only reasonable to suppose that a great deal of sympathy exists between the permanent heads and the Public Service Board. It is quite right that there should be sympathy and co-operation between them. There is, however, a strong feeling that the permanent heads do not take up that independent stand which should be taken by them, despite the opinions of the Public Service Board. Last evening I mentioned a case in which it appeared to me that the permanent head had been induced to comply with the wishes - if not definitely expressed, at any rate implied - of the board, and to act. wrongly towards the officer concerned. Some honorable members may regard this as a minor matter, but to me it is important, because it involves a very big principle. The Public Service Board, in a most injudicious way, pointed out to the permanent head that an officer of his department had infringed a certain regulation. I challenge any honorable member opposite to show that in the action of the public servant there was the slightest infringement of any regulation. When a departmental head goes to the trouble to reprimand an officer and to place a black mark against him in such circumstances, he is either not competent to interpret the regulations, or he is acting in a way that will please the Public Service Board. I take the latter view. I do not think that any officer in the Public Service is able to show that the action of this servant was an infringement of the regulations, and I am therefore driven to the conclusion that the giving of the reprimand to, and the placing of the black mark against, the record of the public servant in question, were the result of a desire to please the Public Service Board. I was rather disappointed that the Prime Minister last evening did not intimate that injustice and tyranny of that kind will not in future be .tolerated by the Public Service Board. The right honorable gentleman went to some trouble to defend highly-placed officers when an accusation was made against them, but he did not take the slightest trouble to defend this occupant of a humble position. It is more important to protect the humble than the highly placed. Charges made against the latter in this House cannot do them any damage. If honorable members are jealous for the good name of the public servants they will see that this tyranny is not persisted in, and that the injustice that has been done will be remedied, or that at least inquiry will be made to ascertain whether or not punishment was unjustly meted out to this officer.

                <para class="block">Minister has told us that under the classification scheme a greater number of officers have had their salaries increased than have had them reduced. I have not before me the full figures, but I have had handed to me those relating to some of the departments, and if the other departments have been treated similarly, I am afraid that the Prime Minister&#39;s information is not correct. In the central office of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department there are six clerical officers, one of whom has had his salary reduced to the extent of &#163;36, two to the extent of &#163;18, and three to the extent of &#163;4. In the High Court of Australia there are two clerks on the staff.. One has been reduced by &#163;36, and the other by &#163;40. In the Arbitration Court there are five clerical officers. The salary of one has been increased by &#163;54 - he is a very lucky fellow - and that of two others has been increased by &#163;6, but the increases have been given in such a way that it is not certain that they will&#39; get them. One other, apparently, has been increased, but the particulars cannot be stated, and the remaining officer has been reduced by &#163;4. In the investigation branch there are three clerical officers. One has been increased by &#163;6, and the others have been decreased by &#163;4. In the statistical branch only one officer was fortunate enough to get an increase, and that amounted to &#163;4. It was the only increase he had had for the last eight years. </para>

                <para class="block">I cannot see any reason for the Government, refusing to grant such an appeal board to the Public Service. Although the state Public Service of New South Wales is the most contented in Australia, recognizing as it does that it is very well paid, it still contends annually that it should have an appeal board of this description. Surely it cannot be argued that trouble would be experienced in selecting an independent  chairman.  Only in rare cases would it be necessary to resort to an appointment by the Governor-General in Council. Such an appeal board would give absolute satisfaction to the public servants, and would ensure that justice would be done to them. Even if they did not get from that board all that they desired, they would still have the satisfaction of knowing that their claims had been justly weighed in the balance. They will by no means be satisfied with the scheme of the Government. It may be argued that a little greater expense will be incurred. Even if that were so, it would be justified by the greater advantages that would . follow. It is not the fault of the public servant that this bill has had to be introduced partly to remedy the foolish mistakes that have been made. I appeal to honorable members to give to public servants the only appeal board that will satisfy them. </para>

                    <para>.- I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. We know that in the Public Service there is frequently a need for an appeal to some tribunal. An appeal board constituted in the way set out in the amendment would be more equitable than that proposed by the Government. It would be able to hear evidence from both sides, and the  chairman,  acting in a judicial capacity, could give a just decision. But the clause merely provides that the appeal shall be considered by a representative of the board in conference with the permanent head or representative of the permanent head and the appellant. Such a conference would not ensure justice to the appellant as would a properly constituted appeal board such as exists in connexion with some of the state public services. The officers representing the board and the permanent head, although actuated by the very best motives, would have a natural tendency to uphold the board as against the appellant. It is almost certain that the representative of the board would not. be sympathetic to the appellant, and the permanent head would incline towards the board rather than towards the appellant. High officers of the Service would naturally have a tendency to work together, but an appeal board constituted as suggested by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. F. McDonald),</inline> with an independent  chairman,  would not be influenced by either the Public Service Board or the permanent head, and would be able to deal with appeals equitably. The  chairman  would probably be a police magistrate or some other person experienced in the weighing of evidence, and such a  chairman  would be more acceptable to public servants generally. I fear that in a conference of the kind proposed in the clause there would be a danger of collusion between the representatives of the Public Service Board and the permanent head to uphold the decisions of the board. I, therefore, hope that the Prime Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  The clause seeks to relieve the board of the obligation to hear all appeals against classification, and, to that end, provides that a representative of the board may confer with the permanent head and the appellant. The amendment proposes the creation of a second tribunal which would have the final decision of all questions relating to classification. If that proposal were adopted there would be two authorities dealing with the one subject. The second authority might be necessary if the rights of the public servant were not safeguarded in any way, but in addition to the board there will be the Public Service Arbitrator. . I dissent from the view that the conference will almost invariably uphold the classification by the board. It is inevitable that in individual cases certain factors that have been overlooked by the board will be brought under consideration at the conference. Honorable members will, at least, give the members of the board credit for good intentions, and if at the conference new facts were elicited, and the classification were shown to be unjust, the board would, I am sure, be prepared to rectify its former mistake. Even if that were not done the public servant would still have the right of recourse to the Public Service Arbitrator. This argument does not apply to promotions, which are dealt with in clause 14, and in regard to which the objection to an appeal from Caesar to Caesar would have greater weight. I suggest that the amendment is unnecessary on the clause now before the committee, and if carried would inevitably lead to a great deal of confusion through giving two bodies authority in respect of the same subject. Classification is a matter of general interest, but promotions and transfers arc individual grievances, and in connexion with them it would be quite reasonable to ensure a right of appeal to a new authority. I ask the honorable member for Barton not to press his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- If the board is appointed to classify, its decisions must  have some finality, just as when an arbitrator is appointed his award must stand. The weakness of the clause, however, is that, whilst it purports to allow an appeal, it does not give the right to the three parties to the conference to make a recommendation to the board. I do not suggest that there should be superimposed upon the Public Service Board another authority that could reject the board&#39;s classification, but I think that the representative of the board, the permanent head of the department affected, and the appellant should form a committee and make a joint recommendation to the board, which presumably would attach due weight to it. </para>

                        <para>- I think that a composite report would be more likely to lead to a compromise. The proposed conference would be satisfactory if the three members of it had equal status. As the clause is drafted, they will have equal authority to submit separate reports, but at the conference the only person who will consider the appeal will be the representative of the board whose classification is in question. </para>

                <para>Mr.FENTON.- That may be so. I believe in making provision for a minority report in such cases, but it seems peculiar that each of the three members of the committee should send in a separate report. By a little give and take the members of the committee might arrive at a unanimous decision, and why should they not in such a case send in but one report. I am interested in securing harmony in the Public Service. I point out that if the appellant is not satisfied with the consideration given to his report or that of his agent he will probably again bring his case before the association to which he belongs, and more trouble may follow. If a board on the lines proposed by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. F. McDonald)</inline> were provided, I think that all concerned would be satisfied. </para>

                <para class="block">Section 27 of the principal act provides that the gazettal of a classification may be wholly or in sections. No doubt the purpose is to meet the convenience of the board in the hearing and determination of appeals. I prefer that the gazettal of the whole classification should be made at the one time. If the classification is approved in sections, officers in the first section approved may suffer seriously as compared with officers in the last section approved. All increases under the classification are to be operative from the 1st July, 1923, but the operation of the reductions will depend on the date of approval of the classification by the Governor-General. Increments in wages must be paid up to the date of approval of the classification. If, for example, the classification of sorters is approved almost immediately, many sorters will lose automatic increments which they would not otherwise lose. In the meantime, many clerks, whose classification has not yet been considered, will continue to receive automatic increments in their wages. Such discrimination is absolutely unjustifiable. I submit my amendment so that all classifications shall be gazetted and operate on the same date. </para>

                    <para>. - Many representations have been made to me on the subject of this bill. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> and the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron),</inline> have brought many points under the Government&#39;s notice. Clause 8 provides for the preservation of the benefits of arbitration awards to employees who are reclassified. It was felt that an injustice might be done to those who were reclassified early if the reclassification was applied piecemeal. To overcome that objection, the Government has drafted an amendment to clause 8. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister suggests that no officer will suffer as a result of sectional reclassifications. The purpose of the amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> is to provide that all appeals against reclassifications must be finally determined before any reclassification operates. We desire that the whole of the reclassifications of the Service shall operate from the same date, and be approved at the same time. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment will lose some of its apparent complication if I explain to honorable members the idea underlying it. The principal act provides for the reclassification of the Service to apply irrespective of awards of the Arbitrator that may be in existence at the time of the reclassification. The Government does not accept the view that the Public Service Board must not, in its reclassification, interfere with existing awards of the Arbitrator, but it does agree that it would be inequitable, and probably harsh, to deprive men immediately upon their reclassification of the benefits of arbitration awards that might have been obtained with great- difficulty, and at great expense. Those who, at the time of the reclassification, are working under awards of the Arbitrator that give them a greater remuneration than they would have under the reclassification scheme, will not have their remuneration reduced while they continue to occupy the same positions. The reclassifications are taking place, and are being gazetted from time to time. In awards of the Arbitrator there are provisions for periodical increments. In the interval between the first and last gazettal of reclassifications these increments will be granted. If the section of the Service in which a man is employed is the last to be gazetted, probably a year, or even two years, after other sections have been gazetted, he may receive automatic increments during that interim period. </para>

A member of the Public Service who is working under an award of the Public Service Arbitrator will be entitled to enjoy all the benefits of that award up to the time of the gazettal of the last reclassification. The amount he is then entitled to under the arbitration award will be taken as the figure below which he cannot be reduced while he continues in his then position. </para>

                        <para>- There is something in that point. Under an award there are automatic and discretionary increments, and the amendment really includes everything an officer is entitled to under the award, and had got at the time of the gazettal of the last classification. The position will be as it would have been if there had been no classification up to that date. There has been a feeling that injustice has been done in regard to certain emoluments to which officers are entitled. The case of the female employees in the Public Service has been mentioned, and, in order to overcome the difficulty, proposed new  sub-section 8 has been moved. It is proposed that no benefit shall be taken away, and that the emoluments shall be included in determining the lowest salary which may be paid. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the amendment means that the salary shall be that received at the date of the award, plus the increments which were due up to the final approval of the classification; but the difficulty is that it is not mandatory that the discretionary increments must be paid when approved by the head of the department. The automatic increments provided by the Arbitrator must be paid by the Government, and I maintain that the discretionary increments also should be paid as soon as the head of the department approves of them. The sole discretion lies with the head of the department, and, when he has made his recommendation, the payment of the discretionary increments is just as binding on the Government as the payment of the automatic increase. If, after the head of the department has given (his approval, the Government declines to pay the discretionary increments, it will commit a breach of the award, and strike a blow at the very roots of arbitration. considering  the position in conjunction with the circular issued recently with the approval of the Treasurer, one sees that an extraordinary situation has arisen. In the Estimates, recently passed, the House approved of the payment of all the discretionary and automatic increases approved by the heads of departments, and the Government was instructed to pay them. I maintain, therefore, that the circular from the Treasury, intimating that, pending further advice, payment of discretionary increments should not be made, should be withdrawn. If there was any justification for issuing the circular before the Estimates were passed - and I dp not think there was - there is certainly no justification for it now. Some of those increments were recommended and approved by the heads of departments before the circular was sent out, and, if I am correctly informed, they are being paid. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that the Prime Minister should issue instructions at once for the withdrawal of the circular. If he undertakes to do that, I shall accept his proposal as substantially satisfactory, for it meets a very intricate situation fairly. But the issuing of the circular was a high-handed action, and if it is not withdrawn it will tend to kill respect for arbitration. It is remarkable that, throughout Australia, the greatest fighting spirits amongst trade unionists have always been ready to abide by decisions reached by arbitration. A number of the awards of the Public Service Arbitrator are open to a good deal of criticism, but it will be a most serious matter if the Government deprives the public servants of half of the increments awarded. It would be disobeying a decision which the Government at least should obey, seeing that it was responsible for the appointment of the Arbitrator. As the amendment meets an awkward situation fairly and effectively up to a certain point, I shall not quarrel with it, but I suggest to the Prime Minister that he give the committee the assurance that the Treasurer&#39;s circular will be withdrawn, and that discretionary increments will be paid as intended by the Arbitrator once the head of the department has approved of them. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause is one of the most important in the bill. It is an endeavour to correct any injustice that is being done to the Public Service, and to make the machinery of the act work smoothly. I am glad that the Government has moved an amendment to straighten out several difficulties. In conjunction with other members who have spoken on this matter, I wish to pay a tribute to the Government for the fair-minded way in which it has endeavoured to deal justly with the Public Service. The honorable member for Yarra, raised the important matter of the payment of discretionary increments. I am entirely in agreement with him, but I believe the difficulty in this respect will be met by the amendment which has been introduced by the Government. I do not think that it was a right action to stop the payment of discretionary increments which had been approved, and for which money had been provided. It was probably done without any desire to be unjust to the officers concerned, and merely as a precautionary measure, because the Government did not wish to commit itself to any increased expenditure before it knew what would be involved by the reclassification. Since the Government has now granted very great concessions under this clause, I feel positive that it will withdraw the Treasurer&#39;s circular. As the honorable member for Yarra said, certain officers have been paid discretionary increments that are now part of their salaries, and will be included in the amount below which their salaries cannot be reduced. Other men whose discretionary increments were approved, but were not paid, are, therefore, placed at a disadvantage which the very structure of the clause is intended to remove. In my opinion; discretionary increments are really included in the provisions of the clause. If they are not included in one way, then they are almost sure to be included in another.

                        <para>- That is a difficulty arising out of the circular. It is almost impossible to say what future discretionary increments would have been approved and what would not. But discretionary increments which have been approved and not paid by the Government should certainly be included under the clause. I suggest as a way out of the difficulty respecting future discretionary increments, that the system in operation up to the issue of the Treasurer&#39;s circular should be continued  to the date of the final approval of the classification, and the discretionary increments which are then granted will become part of the emolument which an officer receives under the Arbitration award, and which is included in proposed new sub-section 8&#176;. This sub-section deals more particularly with allowances granted under the Arbitrator&#39;s awards. It looks simple enough to insert the word &#34; allowance &#34; in addition to the word &#34; salary,&#34; but such an amendment would be quite impracticable, because it would include all sorts of allowances such as special district allowance and others which could not be rightly included. It could be termed an &#34; arbitration allowance,&#34; and if such an allowance were included in the word &#34; emoluments,&#34; I believe that the difficulty would be fully met. In my opinion, that is the intention of the clause, because it includes the words &#34;such emoluments as are prescribed.&#34; This leaves it  open  for specific classes of allowances to be set out by regulation, and a regulation can be readily investigated, criticized, and altered if so desired. The intention, I understand, is that the regulations shall prescribe the different classes of allowances coming under the Arbitrator&#39;s awards, and I am inclined to believe that these discretionary increments will be included in the clause. The amendment is a great concession indeed, and  does  justice to the Public Service. I think most of the difficulties have arisen chiefly because the classification has .come in so quickly on the heels of an award recently made by the Arbitrator. As the Prime Minister has said, it would be wrong to do away altogether with the classification. This would be the effect of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for &#39;Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> which reads - </para>

                        <para>- The Public Service system of arbitration is different from ordinary outside arbitration. If the arbitrator had made no award for six or ten years, no one would have questioned the right of the board to reclassify the Service, and to review the salaries and conditions. There is still an appeal from the classification back to the Arbitrator. Of course, considerable expense will be occasioned in meeting the difficulties that will arise from the reclassification, and that is why the Government consented to the amendment. Every effort is being made to preserve the interests of the individual without interfering with the general principles of the act. I agree entirely with the amendment, and for the reasons I have given I cannot support the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> The adoption of his suggestion would necessitate putting the service under the complete authority of one man, the Arbitrator, instead of under the board, and I consider that that would not be in the interests of the Service. </para>

                    <para>.- Although I listened with interest to the speech of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> I must confess that he has disappointed me. The amendment proposed by the Prime Minister is certainly an improvement on the clause originally submitted by the Government, but still it does not meet the wishes of the Public Service organizations, which desire the unlimited right to appear before the Public Service Arbitrator regardless of whether the results are favorable or otherwise. The proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh is much more acceptable than that of the Government, which must cause innumerable anomalies if it is agreed to. I agree with that part of the Government amendment which provides that the salary of an officer who has been reclassified shall not be reduced so long as he occupies the office to which he is assigned by the classification. I also admit that the Government has made a concession in providing that the emoluments which an officer was entitled to receive under the Arbitrator&#39;s determination shall be preserved for him. But I do not think that the officers of the Service are sufficiently protected from reductions in the future. Section 28 of the principal act reads - </para>

                <para class="block">It is clear, therefore, that the board has power to remove an officer, and can defeat the purposes of this amendment. The Service organizations are not satisfied with the Government&#39;s proposal, for several reasons. In the first place, it still allows the board to depart from the the standard prescribed by the Arbitrator. Their second objection to it is that it will not enable an officer to proceed to the maximum salary fixed for his work by the Arbitrator, and consequently, in time, similar work in the Service will be paid for at various maximum rates. Such discrimination is absolutely unjustifiable. The man who is working on the  maximum prescribed by tie Arbitrator will be in an infinitely better position than the man who is working on the maximum prescribed by the Classification Board. A man in one branch of the Service may be receiving &#163;20 a year more than a man in the same branch for exactly similar work, and men who are discharging highly important duties, and have greater seniority, may be receiving less than officers who have not nearly so many years&#39; service, and are discharging duties that are not nearly so important. In short, the amendment does not safeguard the sacred principle of arbitration. Anomalies will occur notwithstanding the ingenuity of the Prime Minister. We admit that the Prime Minister is endeavouring to meet the situation within the limits of the Government&#39;s policy, but his efforts have not yet satisfied the Service organizations, and this amendment will not develop a spirit of contentment in the Service. Nothing short of a clear line of demarcation between the Arbitrator and the board will meet the case. I submit that the Arbitrator should have complete power to fix salaries, and that the duties of the board should be limited to classifying the Service. The Arbitrator has been working for three years now, and has given general satisfaction to all concerned. He has investigated the work of every department, examined hundreds of witnesses, and appraised the value of the services rendered. He has had a ripe experience of Public Service work, and the .Service is prepared to trust him. In <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> inquiry he made in the clerical case recently, he examined over 100 witnesses, and his award was backed up by reasons, but the board came along and, without consulting the organizations, or taking evidence, made a reclassification. I submit that the methods of the Arbitrator are much better than those of the board, for he takes evidence, hears arguments from both sides, and gives a reasoned judgment. He holds the scales of justice fairly. His methods are in harmony with the general practices of civil life. When a. case is taken before a civil court, and a decision is given, the matter is at rest when once the parties have exhausted all their rights of appeal. That should be so in the Civil Service. When once the Arbitrator has given his award, and the board has taken all the means that are open to it to contest it, it should stand. If our arbitration system is good for persons in private employment and for private employers, it should be good for the Government and for government employees. The Government is an employer, and it should be prepared to accept the legislation which it enacts for private employers. It is well known that the civil servants in all the states are clamouring for the right to appear before the Federal Arbitration Court and for the right of appeal to a civil tribunal. It is strange, therefore, that we should be considering a measure which will really negative the rights of the Commonwealth public servants to arbitration. Another objection to the Government proposal is the ambiguous manner in which emoluments are referred to in proposed new sub-section 8, which reads - </para>

That would seem to debar them from emoluments to which they are entitled under the Arbitrator&#39;s award. Seeing that the Prime Minister has stated that it is intended that the Service shall receive emoluments which are prescribed by the Arbitrator&#39;s determination, I think that the proposed new sub-section needs an amendment, and at the request of the Service organizations I move - </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment proposed by the  Prime Minister is, so far as it goes, satisfactory. It gives protection to officers while they retain positions within their  reclassification, but does not protect them if they are promoted. It is possible, however, owing, to the large reductions to which some officers are being subjected, that upon being promoted, they will be receiving less than before their reclassification. Some female employees are suffering a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i4</inline> per annum, and even though they receive promotion, the difference between the classified salaries for the old and new positions will be so slight that they will not be recouped their loss through reclassification. I should like an assurance from the Prime Minister that discretionary increments are covered by the term &#34; emoluments &#34; in the proposed new sub-section 8 of section 27. I think the Government has done a great injustice to some officers - it has, in fact, done something for which it has no legal warrant. Certain increments are to be paid at the discretion of the permanent head, and I contend that immediately the permanent head gives his approval such increments are&#39; a legal obligation in the same way as are any other increments. The Treasurer some time ago issued a circular stating that these  discretionary  increments would not be paid, and the permanent heads, taking the hint, have refused to give approval to such increments. As a result of that action a number of officers are being unjustly treated. They are men who have had lengthy service, and do not receive automatic increments as do the lower paid officers. Before a man may receive a discretionary increment he must show special ability, and have rendered exceptional service. I suggest that the action of the Treasurer, by which these increments have been withheld, is equivalent to a. repudiation of the principle of arbitration, for the permanent head would infer from the Treasurer&#39;s circular that he was not expected to approve of any more increments. The withdrawal of the circular would meet the requirements of justice. Alternatively, an amendment upon the Prime Minister&#39;s amendment will be necessary. The permanent heads might now be instructed that when special ability and good service stand to the credit of officers, increments may be approved as before the Treasurer&#39;s circular was issued. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment submitted by the Government is, I think, acceptable to the committee except that some honorable members would like it to go further. I do not think there &#39; is the slightest doubt that a discretionary increment that is being paid will be regarded as ail &#34; emolument &#34; received in pursuance of arbitration. Similarly there can be no possible question that discretionary increments which have not been approved will not be so regarded, for it is obvious that no one can say how the discretion of the permanent head would be exercised. The circular notification by the Treasurer that discretionary increments recommended by departmental heads would not be paid arose out of the pending classification, and the uncertainty regarding the proposed legislation that is now before the committee, but I shall consult the Treasurer at once in regard to its withdrawal. The female employees referred to by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> are covered by the amendment, which has been drafted to meet cases of that kind. The rights of public servants to approach the Arbitrator in future are in no way interfered with by this measure. The reclassification contemplated by the bill means that the board shall again review the Service, try to remove anomalies, and put the whole classification on a new basis. In regard to the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Reid, the intention is that the word &#34; emoluments &#34; shall cover all- payments that arise out of the Arbitrator&#39;s award. At this moment I am not prepared to say whether or not the words proposed by the honorable member for Reid to be included are necessary, but regulations will be issued, and there will be an opportunity to challenge them if they do not, in fact, provide what I assure the committee is intended, namely, that what are legitimately considered to be Arbitrator&#39;s allowances shall be included in the salary awarded. </para>

                    <para>.- Discrimination between officers because of the Treasurer&#39;s circular will be very unjust. If the circular is withdrawn, and money is made available for the payment of discretionary increments, it should be possible for the Government to arrange for increments which would have been approved but for that circular to be treated in the same way as those which have been approved and paid. </para>

                <para>The remarks of the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E.. Riley)</inline> are very pertinent to this amendment. The Prime Minister has informed the committee that the right of public servants to approach the Public Service Arbitrator will be preserved, but there is a &#34; catch in it.&#34; Although the determinations may govern a certain office, if the occupant of that -office is (transferred or promoted prior to an amended award of the Arbitrator being made he will come - under the reclassification of the Public Service Board, and may suffer a reduction in salary. Although a public servant, while he remains in his present office, will receive the benefits of awards of the Arbitrator, he may lose those benefits if he is transferred or promoted to another position. Let me give a concrete instance. An officer who, at the date of the approval of the reclassification, is occupying the position of invoice examining officer in the Victorian Customs Department, draws a salary under the award of &#163;430. The salary allotted to his position under the reclassification scheme is &#163;420. If he is transferred after the reclassification to the position of invoice examining officer in another state- a change involving no alteration in status - the clause will permit the board to reduce his salary to &#163;420. An award of the Public Service Arbitrator should continue until he makes an amending award. Otherwise, what need is there for a Public Service Arbitrator? My proposal is a very fair one. Many of our public servants have devoted a lot of time and patience, and have spent considerable sums of money, in preparing plaints to place before the Arbitrator, and they have borne themselves in patience while awaiting the determinations. The benefits they have thus secured may be lost to them by the reclassification. If the Government desires to deal with these men equitably, fairly, and honorably, it will accept my amendment, which, on the fact of it, justifies itself. It will give to our public servants, who have pinned their faith to arbitration, an opportunity of enjoying the awards they have obtained. The onus is upon the Government to actfairly. </para>

                    <para>. -  The amendment of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> if I understand it rightly, is intended to provide that the Public Service Board, in reclassifying the Service, shall not interfere with existing awards of the Arbitrator. To that I cannot assent, as I have already indicated. But the honorable member seems to have introduced another point. He hae referred to an officer who, when reclassification takes place, continues to enjoy, in accordance with the amendment agreed to by the committee, the benefits of an award of the Public Service Arbitrator. A possible result of the transfer of that officer to another position would be to reduce his salary, although he might be alleged&#39; to be promoted. The honorable member suggests that his salary should not be reduced, except under an award of the Arbitrator: If the amendment were agreed to it would be impossible to penalize an officer for an offence, as provided for under sections 55 and 67. I discussed the matter with the Public Service Board, and it was pointed out to me that an officer could not be promoted and paid a lower salary. </para>

                        <para>-  I realize that there are regrettable features, and that some of the difficulties are insuperable. There would be no trouble if we could put the whole matter into the hands of the Arbitrator, but it would be physically impossible for him to carry out the classification, and most people agree that the whole of the Public Service should be classified. The other alternative is that the board should reclassify the Service, and that there should be no recognition of awards made by the Arbitrator. That also would be an unsatisfactory arrangement. It would not contribute to the contentment and well-being of the Service, and, therefore, the Government was forced to classify the Service, at the same time not depriving it of the benefits of the decisions of the Arbitrator. We are now faced with the clear-cut issue whether the Arbitrator should be paramount, or whether the classification should continue with certain safeguards. </para>

The illustration given by the honorable member for Hindmarsh was somewhat extraordinary, and I do not think that such a case could occur. I should like to know how the Prime Minister interprets the words &#34; so long as he occupies the office to which he is assigned by the classification &#34; ? The award of the Arbitrator may vary in different states. Could the board reduce the salary of an officer by transferring him from, say, Melbourne to Sydney? </para>

We must depend to a large extent on the Arbitrator and on the board. It would be manifestly outrageous, and contrary to the intentions of the Government, if such a reduction in salary could be effected by the board, and I think that it would be wise to place that view on record. </para>

                    <para>. -  The position stated by the honorable member for Hindmarsh is correct. When an officer is transferred, the classification may provide for his position a smaller salary than he was previously receiving. This anomaly is not removed by the amendment which the committee has just carried, and, therefore, the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh should be accepted, in order to place the matter beyond all doubt. We are told that the Public Service Board has conferred a great benefit upon the Public Service, but we have only to compare the rates under the classification with those under the Arbitrator&#39;s award to see the exact position. The existing rates for assistants and postmen in the Mail Branch range from &#163;202 to &#163;239 per annum, and under the classification from &#163;202 to &#163;234. </para>

                        <para>- The figures that I am quoting were supplied to me by the Public Service Association, and I am showing how they affect the individual. They certainly do not agree with those mentioned by the Prime Minister. The existing rates under the Arbitrator&#39;s last award for Mail Branch sorters range from &#163;247, with &#163;8 annual increments, to &#163;295 per annum, and under the classification from &#163;240, with &#163;6 annual increments, to &#163;276. If those figures are correct, and I can vouch for them, the position under the classification will be infinitely worse. The great trouble is that the Public Service Board is trying to deal with the classification and with the fixation of wages. The Prime Minister stated that no body of men could perform both of those functions. It was never intended that the Public Service Board should deal with the fixation of salaries. That work should be left entirely to the Arbitrator. It may. happen in the future that the board will fix a lower salary than that prescribed by award. An appeal will follow to the Arbitrator, and he will make another award, and so on, indefinitely. It is a stupid and intolerable position. To ensure that the Arbitrator&#39;s awards shall stand, the committee should accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

                    <para>. -The amendment that the committee has just passed protects an officer only so long as he occupies the office to which he is assigned by the classification, but the moment he vacates that office it is quite likely that he may receive a lower salary. It seems stupid to promote at less salary. Notwithstanding any assurance to the contrary that the Prime Minister has given this afternoon, those who administer the act will not be able to go beyond its scope, and they will be forced, when an officer is promoted, to give him the  salary assigned to the position. If he refuses to accept it because it means a reduction, he will be debarred from promotion for all time unless, of course, he is promoted two grades at once, which is quite unlikely. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, because, under the classification, there is a difference of &#163;44 in the salaries of certain women in the General Post Office. If they accept promotion, it is quite likely that their salaries will be decreased. There is a clear-cut issue involved in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. We stand for the principle of arbitration. When the board was appointed it was never intended that it should deal with the fixation of wages. The board, when making the reclassification, entirely ignored the whole of the work previously done by the Arbitrator - an officer who went to great trouble to fix the salaries of the public servants in accordance with the cost of living and other factors. The members of the board have not had the slightest experience in fixing salaries, and yet they placed on one side the experience of the Arbitrator, and flouted his determinations. It was a very unbusinesslike proceeding, and has caused a great deal of duplication. It is casting aside all the splendid and laborious work of the Arbitrator. As the Arbitrator is trusted by the Service, we submit that the power to fix salaries should be vested in him. If he is not able to inquire into the case of every officer, we suggest that provision should be made that in any cases which the Public Service Board considers, it should be obliged to adopt the salary basis laid down by the Public Service Arbitrator. Had provision been made for that in the first place, the prevailing discontent and dissatisfaction in the Service would not have occurred. If provision is not made for it now, we can expect nothing other than a continuation of the present unsatisfactory situation. The rejection of the amendment moved by the honorable member for. Hindmarsh can mean nothing other than unnecessary expense and delay, and continued discontent in the Service, which can be avoided by giving the Arbitrator complete control in the fixation of salaries. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of the proposed proviso is clearly to take away from former state officers who owe their appointment to the Commonwealth Service to the passing of a competitive examination, the right to consider their state and federal public service as continuous service. The doubt about the matter now is generally resolved in favour of the officer. I am quite prepared to admit that it is not unreasonable to provide that state officers who will join the Commonwealth Service in the future in consequence of a competitive examination shall not be permitted to consider their state and federal service as continuous, but I object to a retrospective provision of that nature. If this proviso is agreed to, persons who enter the Commonwealth Service in the future will do so with their eyes open, and because they think that by so doing they will better their position. I urge the Prime Minister to accept the amendment. When we were discussing clause 3 of the Income Tax Collection Bill last year, I raised this question. The following is a quotation from the report of those proceedings: - </para>

                    <para>. - The purpose of the honorable member&#39;s amendment is to ensure that only in future shall the state service of a man who enters the Commonwealth Service as the result of passing a competitive examination not to be counted. I understand that since 1902, the practice continuously followed, first by the commissioner, and latterly by the board, has been not to count state service as continuous with Commonwealth service in the circumstances set out in the clause. Therefore I see nothing objectionable in the retrospective effect of this clause. Although the Government has no strong views about the retrospective provision, I suggest to the committee that, having regard to continuous past- practice, no advantage would be gained by eliminating it. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister has said that the practice in regard to ex-state officers who enter the Commonwealth Service by means of competitive examination has been what is proposed in the clause. I admit that there has always been a doubt regarding the- meaning of section 48&#39;, but last year, when the House was dealing with the Income Tax Collection Bill, I received from the Attorney-General an assurance that the state service of officers would be counted as continuous with the Commonwealth Service. </para>

                        <para>- What was done on that occasion disproves the right honorable gentleman&#39;s assertion that the continuous practice in the past has been what the clause purposes to legalize. If past practice has been, in the main, what the Prime Minister has said, no alteration will be effected by striking out the retrospective provision, but if the clause is agreed to without amendment the change will apply to officers who are about to retire from the taxation and other departments, and are due to receive compensation. Already officers who expect to be retired have been, informed that their state service will not be considered, notwithstanding that others who entered the Commonwealth. Service as the result of competitive examination have been paid compensation on the basis of continuous state and Commonwealth, service. I believe the object of the .clause is to legalize au unfair discrimination. When the Income Tax Collection Act was before the House last year, I received an assurance from the Attorney-General that state and Commonwealth service would be counted as continuous. </para>

                    Yes. Section 48. is not quite clear, but it can be interpreted to mean that state service is continuous with Commonwealth service. But for the interpretation of section 48 given by the Attorney-General, I should have moved an amendment; to&#62; the Income Tax Collection Bill to ensure that state service should count. That assurance was honoured by the Government in relation to the officers immediately transferred under the Income Tax Collection Act, but we are now asked to legislate that the same consideration shall not extend to other men who* retire under the same statute. Strong, reasons are required to justify retrospective legislation, and they are not in evidence in this instance. State service should count with Commonwealth service, regardless of the avenue by which the officer entered the employ of the Federal Government; but whatever the committee may decide as to the future, it should not allow the clause to have a retrospective effect. I feel strongly upon this subject, because the Government is proposing repudiation as regards those officers of the taxation service who were not retired immediately after the passing of the Income Tax Collection Act.

                    <para>. - About 76 female officers were transferred from the federal to the state taxation departments in consequence of the passing of the Income Tax Collection Bill. Those officers retained their superannuation and furlough rights. As no provision was made in the new Public Service Act for a marriage allowance, it automatically ceased on the 17th July, 1923. This clause proposes to re-enact the allowance,&#39; and make it retrospective. The transferred officers to whom I have referred desire that special provision be made for them, as this allowance would have applied in  one  case prior to the transfer to the state Service. They contend that, as their transfer was compulsory, they should retain the right to the marriage allowance. Certain rights accrued to these female officers, as for example, superannuation and furlough, and they consider that they also have a claim to the marriage allowance. </para>

The question will require some investigation, and I am afraid that it cannot be dealt with now. The clause applies to members of the Public Service and if the rights of these female officers were preserved to them under their transfer, I should certainly say that the clause would be applicable to them, but it is a question for legal determination. </para>

                <para class="block">I referred, during my second-reading speech, to the anomaly with which my amendment deals, and I emphasized the unfairness of the existing provision. Twelve months ago I stated the experience of an officer named J. Mortby, and  asked for some finality. The Treasurer premised consideration, but finality has not yet been reached. The man is engaged in the Federal Taxation Office, in Adelaide. He is a fourth-class officer, and was transferred, on probation, to tha third class. Consistently, for two years, he has been discharging the duties of a third-class officer, but has been receiving the pay of only a fourth-class officer. He has been recommended for promotion, but the Public Service Board refuses to act on that recommendation. Under the existing provision, the board is encouraged to require a man to perform duties of a higher grade, while he receives the salary of a lower grade. Surely it cannot be contended that that is either equitable or just. When a man is transferred to a higher office, he should receive the salary of that office. That contention applies equally to factory workers and professional men. The board hae. taken undue advantage of its powers to promote men on probation, and has been underpaying them for the services they render. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mortby</inline> is classified as a fourth-class officer, and hae been satisfactorily doing the work of a third-class officer for two years. </para>

If an appeal against a promotion had still to be considered, it would not be wise to pay to the person who was subject to the appeal the emoluments applicable to the office he held, in, view of the possibility that he might fail on the appeal to hold the office. </para>

It will give the heads of departments the right to decide transfers and promotions, subject to appeal to the board. I have heard a lot about such appeals. A case came under my notice recently in which the head of a department dealt very arbitrarily with an appellant. An appeal against the action of the head of a department should go direct to the board, and not through the head of the department against whose decision the appeal is made. The adoption of that suggestion would not militate against discipline. </para>

Any appeal under this section shall be determined by a conference consisting of a representative of the board, a representative of the Permanent Head of the Department in which the vacancy occurs and  a  representative of the organization to which the appellant belongs or may belong, and any such appeal shall be forwarded to the representative of the board on such conference by the Permanent Head of the Department in which the appellant officer is employed.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">The object of my amendment is to provide a proper method of appeal in connexion with promotions. The Government&#39;s amendment means that an officer may submit his case in writing to the board. This is a. great departure from the procedure laid down in the 1902-18 act, by which, a special board was provided for the hearing of appeals against promotions. This board consisted of a representative of the Public Service Commissioner, a representative of the permanent head of the department in which the vacancy occurred, and a divisional representative elected by the officers. The suggestion now made by the officers is that an appeal conference be created on somewhat similar lines to those of the special appeal board constituted under the 1902-18 act. Both the hoard and the department would be represented on the conference, and the officer originally promoted would be sufficiently represented by reason of the fact that the department responsible for the promotion would seek to justify its action in making the promotion. The Public Service organizations are only desirous of obtaining a proper tribunal to hear appeals; they are not concerned with the claims of the parties to disputes. The suggestion that an appellant should be represented by his organization is made simply on the ground that every party concerned in the promotion should be represented. Seeing that a board constituted on somewhat similar lines has been successful in the past, it would be well to make provision for it here in preference to the proposal of the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I suggest that the amendments proposed by the Government are a very great improvement on the existing provisions. They provide for an independent tribunal to deal with officers who think that they have not had fair treatment in regard to promotion. Under the present act the board has made the promotions and transfers, but under the Government&#39;s amended proposal the permanent heads of the departments will make them, and there will be a direct right of appeal to an entirely distinct body - that is, the Public Service Board. It has been suggested that this will mean that the board will, in reality, make the appointments, but I wish to remove any misapprehension in that regard. When a promotion or transfer is made by the permanent head, it will be gazetted, not over the name of the board, but over the name of that permanent head, who will be directly responsible for his action. Consequently, the appeal will be to an entirely different tribunal. While this arrangement may be quite satisfactory in the capital city which is the Seat of Government, it will not be so satisfactory in the other states where the permanent head of the department is not actually resident, and where the recommendations for promotion will rest with. the senior officers representing the permanent head in those states. Again, it may very well he that the representative of &#39;the permanent head will consult with the Public Service inspector with regard to the promotions he proposes to make, in order to be quite sure that there will be no trouble afterwards as to the recommendations made. I appreciate that that is a real danger, and will to some extent destroy the independent character of the appeal which is granted to  the public servant under this provision. The board, therefore, is now issuing strict instructions to its inspectors that they must in no way concern themselves with, or take any part in, the recommendations of the representative of the permanent head in each of the states Thus the permanent head who makes the promotion with be quite independent of the Public Service Board to whom appeals are to be made. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to call attention to a case that seems to me to be apropos. I have in mind an officer in Western Australia who has appealed against the promotion of a fellow officer to whom he is senior. He telegraphed to me asking that I should take up his case before the Public Service Board. Of course, I could not do that, and I advised him to get into touch with the secretary of his organization here. I am told that an officer appealing against a promotion in another state must submit his case to the board in Melbourne. It appears that an officer located in a state other than Victoria is at a disadvantage in having to place his case before a body of men who are unable to obtain first-hand information concerning it. Would it not be possible to have such cases heard in the state concerned ? </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to know whether the conditions applying to the Public Service Board apply . to the heads of departments as well? What the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has said is quite true. I remember, in my early experience in Par-, li anient, a case was brought before me. I saw the Public Service Commissioner, and he said to me, &#34; Do you intend to press this case?&#34; I said, &#34; This man has been harshly treated, and I feel inclined to press the matter.&#34; He informed me that if I did so he would have nothing further to do with the case. I looked at him in surprise, and he said, &#34; I am bound by act of Parliament. If I accede to your request, it will be said that you, as a member of Parliament, used influence, on behalf of this man. I have told Prime Ministers the same thing.&#34; - 1 said, &#34; Under those circumstances I withdraw from the case.&#34; The Public Service Board is supposed to be absolutely immune from political influence, and the heads of departments should be placed in the same position. Honorable members who have had any experience with the Public Service know that it is possible for heads of departments to have their favorites, and these officers are pushed ahead at the expense of perhaps more deserving men. The power to make appointments should not be placed in the hands of heads of departments. </para>

                    <para>.- The position mentioned by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is, I think, met for the first time under this bill. I have examined this matter carefully,&#34; because it is necessary to safeguard promotions and the right of appeal. In this respect the principal act. was not so satisfactory, because appointments were made practically on the recommendation of the Public Service Inspector in consultation with the permanent head or the  deputy  permanent head in the state concerned. The recommendation was then forwarded to the board in Melbourne for approval. Any appeal was referred back to the board Ah, officer in any distant state wishing to appeal would have to travel to Melbourne at his own expense to state his case to the board. That disadvantage will be removed under this clause. The recommendation of the permanent head should be made quite independent of any consultation with the representative of the board in the state concerned. The Public Service Inspector, as the representative of the board, should have nothing at all to do with promotions or transfers, so that he may be in a neutral and independent position in connexion with the hearing of appeals. That is provided for under the clause. A permanent head will make no recommendation which is not justified, because his every action will come under independent review, and cannot be fixed up, as is supposed to have been done in the past, by previous consultation with the local Public Service Inspector. This position is entirely safeguarded, because under the clause the board will issue definite instructions that the Public Service Inspectors in the different states shall take no part in making recommendations for promotions. </para>

The honorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green) is quite correct in his reading of the. proposed amendment of the act. It does, in fact, provide for the delegation of the functions of the board, including the right to hear appeals against promotions and classification, and will meet the situation exactly as the honorable member has suggested. </para>

                <para class="block">These paragraphs affect the rights of the public servants in respect to payment for holidays. The universal system adopted by Arbitration Court judges is to award payment for the performance of holiday service. If leave in lieu of payment is granted, the officers who are working will be called upon to perform the duties of the absent officer between them. Extra recreation leave in lieu of holiday work is not desired by the officers themselves,  nor is it in the interests of the administration. The principle has never been adopted in outside employment. It will be recognized that working on a public holiday is not by any means compensated for by a day off at another time. A holiday has a definite value beyond that of an ordinary day included in recreation leave. The proposal in paragraph e that an extra holiday should be given to Commonwealth public servants is made merely to bring the Commonwealth into conformity with State Service practice. The last conference of Premiers decided . that there should be fourteen holidays for every state, and it is in pursuance of this resolution that an extra holiday is being given by  the Commonwealth, but the substitution of time off instead of payment is not at all satisfactory. Under paragraph / power is to be given to the Public Service Board to compel certain officers to work on holidays without extra payment or leave in lieu. Such power was not vested in the administrative authorities under the two previous acts, and the wide discretionary power it is now proposed to give to the board is altogether too drastic. Payment for holiday work should be granted irrespective of the salary of the officer who is obliged to work, and it should he on a fair and reasonable scale. The granting of extra recreation leave instead of payment for holidays worked does not in any sense meet the case. </para>

                    <para>. - The position has not .been put quite fully to the committee. The officers of the Service will retain all their existing rights in respect to statutory holidays, but a distinction is made between statutory holidays and additional holidays. &#34;Additional holidays&#34; are such days as show days and race days in provincial centres, and the number that may. be allowed by proclamation has been increased from three to four. lt will not be suggested that these holidays, which in most cases are of local importance only, should be treated as statutory holidays. The position is very fairly met, I suggest, by allowing any officer who is required to work on such a day to have an extra day in lieu thereof added to his annual leave. The regulations framed in pursuance of these provisions will lay down that no officer in receipt of less than &#163;450 per annum will be affected. </para>

                <para class="block">Although this is the last clause of the bill, it is by no means the least important. If it is agreed to, it will take away from the officers in the various departments of the second, third, and fourth divisions of the Service the status that they nt present enjoy, and, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech on the measure, it will cause endless confusion in filing plaints to be heard by the Arbitrator. The proposed amendment is unreasonable and unnecessary. Instead of doing anything to decrease the status of our officers, we should be doing everything possible to increase it, for the hope of obtaining an increased status encourages efficiency. Officers of exceptional ability should not- be deprived of the recognition which they at present enjoy. The acceptance of the clause will have a depressing effect upon the Service, and I cannot help feeling that it will lead to inefficiency and dissatisfaction. It will mean that the Arbitrator will be required to deal with each of the divisions mentioned as a whole, and will not be able to give the necessary careful consideration to certain highly specialized branches of them. Another objection to the clause is that it will debar the officers of the divisions concerned from making personal application to the Arbitrator for the consideration of their claims. </para>

                    <para>. - The elimination of this clause, as suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, would be a mistake. It is merely a substitute for a clause already in the act, but instead of the Service being divided into classes, it lays down that the classification and salary shall be on the basis of work done. Under the act the Service is divided into a limited number of classes in each division, and that necessitates a very large range of salaries inside a particular class. The policy of the Public Service Board is to divide the Service according to classification with a much narrower range of salaries, but inside such divisions the increments will be automatic and annual. This proposal is infinitely better than the existing system in the interests, not of the Government or the board, but of the public servants themselves. It will give to them a much greater opportunity than they have at the present time. </para>

                    <para>. - If the amendment were agreed to, the position of state officers entering the Commonwealth Service by competitive examination in future would be defined, but as regards past entrants the position would be somewhat uncertain. A decision given by the Crown Law officers in 1903 left no possibility of doubt that state officers entering the Commonwealth Service through the medium of competitive examination were not entitled to have their previous service taken into account. Since 1922, however, there has been a doubt upon this point. The legal rights of officers in this regard have never been tested, but both the Commissioner and the board have acted as if the state Service were definitely excluded. If the amendment be agreed to it will create an anomalous position, for any public servant who entered the Commonwealth Service by competitive examination prior to the coming into existence of the 1922 act would not be entitled to any consideration in respect of state service, and the same deprivation would extend to officers entering the Commonwealth Service after this bill becomes law; but those who entered between the proclamation of the 1922 act and the coming into effect of this measure would constitute a limited class entitled to a privilege not enjoyed by any other officers similarly circumstanced. It would be undesirable to create invidious distinctions of that kind. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> stressed the fact that in the granting of compensation to taxation officials who left the Commonwealth Service the period of state service was recognized, but special circumstances surrounded those oases, and if on any future occasion this Parliament were considering the compensation of officers who left the Service in consequence of a complete reversal of policy such as followed the agreement between the Commonwealth and states in regard to taxation collection, it. would no doubt legislate to give special consideration to those officers. I do not think that the compensation provisions of the Income Tax Collection Act constitute a precedent that should regulate the treatment of entrants to the Service between  1922  and the coming into operation of this measure. The honorable member for Yarra quoted an opinion expressed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> last year regarding the rights of the taxation officers. It ill-befits me as a mere acting Attorney-General, not at all learned in law, to attempt to inter- ?ret section  48  of the principal act, but remind the committee that the Attorney-General merely gave an offhand opinion in the course of debate, and I do not think that upon mature consideration he would have declared it to be an accurate statement of the law. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the explanation by the Prime Minister, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I realize that it would create a complication, but I ask the. Prime Minister to give me an assurance that all officers who may be retired in accordance with the amalgamation scheme under the Income Tax Collection Act will receive the same treatment. I confess that at the time I was astonished at the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General last year, but I recognized that it was given hastily at about  4  o&#39;clock in the morning. Nevertheless it was accepted by the committee in good faith, and acted upon by the Government until recently. Since that time officers who have made application to retire in the belief that their compensation would be based upon continuity of state and Commonwealth Service, have learned that they are to be treated differently from their colleagues who retired earlier. </para>

                <para class="block">The Public Service Board for some time past has taken up the attitude that persons with &#34; prior service,&#34; who entered the Commonwealth Public Service by virtue of the passing of competitive examinations, are not entitled, either morally or legally, to have their prior service recognized. Clause  12  is intended to remove any doubt as to the legal right of such persons.&#39; The board contends that, from the moral point of view, a person with prior service, who sits for an examination, voluntarily places himself on the same footing of competition as a person employed by a private firm, who elects to enter the Commonwealth Public Service through the medium of the same examination. For example, a .public school teacher who passes the Commonwealth clerical examination has no more right to have his service as a state school teacher recognized for furlough purposes than a clerk has a claim for recognition of his service in a commercial house. The view of the Service organizations is that continuous service under the Crown, in any capacity, should count for furlough purposes, which is the only way in which section  48  of the principal act is likely to operate! If clause  12  is passed in its present form some very serious anomalies will result. For example, a naval rating transferred to the Customs Department as a boatman or searcher, without examination, &#62; will have his service in the </para>
                <para class="block">Navy counted for furlough purposes. But if he has had the industry to pass an examination for appointment to the third division, his prior service will not be counted. Professional officers are transferred from state or railway services to the Commonwealth Service without the necessity of passing a competitive examination, although their eligibility to enter the Commonwealth Service is generally proved by the passing of outside professional qualifying examinations. The prior service of such officers will count for furlough purposes by virtue of section 48 of the principal act. On the other hand, clerks who have had prior state service will not obtain the benefit of section 48, if clause 12 is passed, because they .are appointed by virtue of the passing of a Public Service competitive examination. That introduces an undesirable class distinction. A warrant officer in the Military Forces, who has sufficient ambition to induce him to pass an entrance examination to the Commonwealth Public Service, will lose all the benefit of his service as a permanent soldier. An engineer officer in the Naval or Military Forces, who enters the Commonwealth Public Service as a professional officer, without passing an examination, will retain the benefit of his service as a permanent soldier or sailor. All the above oases have this essential point in common - the persons concerned have preferred the Commonwealth to the state as an employer. Some enter the Commonwealth Service without examination, others have to prove their claim to admission by examination. Yet the persons required to sit for an examination are prejudiced by that very fact. It is strongly urged that prior service should count, irrespective of the method of entrance to the Public Service. It should be carefully noted that the service under the Crown must be of a continuous nature before any privilege under section 48 of the principal act can be secured. Therefore I ask the committee to agree to eliminate the disqualifying word &#34; not.&#34; I ask the committee to eliminate the word &#34; not&#34; in order to give those who  enter  the Service either by direct transfer, or after passing a competitive examination, the same rights and privileges as are enjoyed under the present legislation. The officers affected by the disqualification under this clause are those on the lower rungs of the ladder, and they should be placed on the same footing as the higher officers whose rights will be preserved. </para>

                    BRUCE  (Flinders- Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) &#91;8.201. - I cannot accept the amendment. The Government&#39;s proposal is that where a state public servant enters the Commonwealth Service by passing a competitive examination, he shall not be entitled to the rights reserved to those who come in as transferred officers. There is good reason for such a provision. Take the case referred to by the honorable member. If a state schoolmaster elects to enter a competitive examination in order to obtain appointment to the Commonwealth Service he does it entirely of his own volition, and surely it is only equitable that he should be placed in the same position as any other citizen who voluntarily endeavours to obtain employment in the Service.

                <para class="block">That the following new clause bo inserted :  - &#34;10a. Section thirty of the Principal Act is amended by adding the following proviso: - Provided that where female officers perform similar duties to those of male officers, the salaries of such female officers shall be equal to those of such male officers.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable members should recognize the fairness of this provision. There is no reason why a female employee should not receive the same remuneration, allowances, and emoluments as are provided for a male employee, if she does the same class of work. Too often the belief is held that women are the weaker sex, but very often they are the stronger sex, and they are entitled to the same consideration that is extended to male employees. Therefore I make no apology, and submit no excuse,, for moving the amendment to place the female members of the Service on a footing equal to that of the men. When a service is rendered it should be paid for according to its value, without regard to the sex of the person that renders it. This principle has been endorsed by the courts of this country; and why the Government, with its reactionary tendencies, should desire to go back to the dim and distant ages of the past, and resurrect a principle that is out of keeping with the progress of this young democracy, I cannot understand. Prior to 1914 equal pay for equal work was granted by the Public Service Commissioner.In the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in 1915 equal pay was again granted. In 1920 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers granted equal rates to males and females in the Australian Letter Carriers Association award, and in the same year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke confirmed that principle. The Commonwealth Government, in November of the same year, granted an allowance of &#163;12 per annum to cover the increased cost of living, and it made no distinction between male and female members of the Service; yet to-day it asks honorable members to endorse legislation that will deprive female members of the Service of the recognition that is rightly their due. It remains for the womenfolk of this country to rise in righteous indignation against a government that fails to recognize their proper status. A government that will not recognize the quality of women as citizens and employees deserves to be swept into political oblivion, and the time for such a process is fast approaching. Many women have to accept equal obligations with men, and shoulder the responsibility of maintaining homes. An unfortunate aspect is that,, as soon as women are employed at a lower rate of pay than men, there is a desire, whether in the Public Service or private employment, to deprive men of employment by engaging the cheaper female labour. To protect women in their standard of living, and men who have to maintain families, it is very desirable that the two sexes should receive equal remuneration for work done. It is a fundamental, cardinal principle, and members of the Opposition will not budge an inch in their support of it. Recognizing that, perhaps, all the debate that one could engage in, and all the powers of persuasion and eloquence that one might desire to pour on this weak and feeble-minded Government, would never awaken them to their responsibilities, we shall wait until the opportunity is afforded for these people to record their protest against the way in which the Government has subordinated their rights and interests. </para>

Both sides of the committee have an equal appreciation of the fact that female employees are entitled to proper remuneration for the services they render, and I go so far as to say that they ought to receive equal remuneration if they do equal work. But we have to analyze what we mean by &#34; remuneration,&#34; and for once I can give to honorable gentlemen opposite the authority of the Public Service Arbitrator, for whom they have expressed great admiration during the consideration of this bill. They have urged that the Government should place the control of the Service in the hands of that official, without the right of interference by the Public Service Board. The Public Service Arbitrator, in his judgment in the case of the Federal Public Service Assistants Association and the Commonwealth Public Service Board of Commissioners and others has left no doubt of his view of this matter. He answers the question, &#34; What is equal remuneration ?&#34; in the following way: - </para>

                <para>Reverting to my question - what are wages <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> A fair answer that may be given is that they comprise such a sum as will provide, first, the necessaries of life, and, second, a surplus which may be expended at the will of the earner for extras in the way of travel, books, amusements, luxuries, &#38;c, or devoted to savings or investments. If, acting on the two assumptions previously set out, one takes the case of a married man and a single woman, it is obvious that if .they both receive the same wage then the woman will have a far larger sum at her free disposal than the man, because it will cost her much less to procure for herself the necessaries of life than it will cost the man to procure those necessaries for two persons. That is to say, the effective value of the woman&#39;s wages for the purpose of procuring pleasure or profit for herself will be far greater than the effective value of the man&#39;s wages. The necessary consequence is that in cases of equal payment, the single woman receives a far greater actual benefit from her wages than the married man.

                <para class="block">In fixing salaries, the Public Service Board adopts two . basic rates of wages. The first is regarded as sufficient for a married man, and the second as sufficient for a single woman. To those basic wage rates is added a marginal wage to cover the value </para>

                    of skill. For work which is identical, the same amount is received for skill by the man and the woman. The basic rate for an adult .male clerk is &#163;216 per annum, and for an adult female &#163;162. The margin for skill in both cases is &#163;60. That results in a salary of &#163;276 being paid to the adult male, and &#163;222 to the adult female, which is a difference of &#163;54 in the amount received by the two individuals. Regarding their remuneration in the light of the remarks of the Public Service Arbitrator, however, they receive the same reward for the services they are rendering. The honorable member has suggested that the industrial tribunals of Australia have accepted the view that equal rates should be paid to male and female workers, but that is not the case. Industrial tribunals, including the Federal Arbitration Court, have made a distinction in the rates of pay to the sexes. I refer honorable members opposite to the case before the Public Service Arbitrator from which I have quoted, and which, I think, has been followed by many other similar decisions, and to the records of the industrial tribunals of this country. I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. The final determination of what is the remuneration paid to an individual is the amount of benefit which that individual derives from it.. The avenues of pleasure enjoyed by a single female and a married man with three children, for example, if they receive equal remuneration, are vastly dif*ferent.  The principle of differentiation has been carried much further than this in actual practice. The Commonwealth Government pays an allowance of &#163;13 per annum for each child. This obviously . means that for the same work a married man with four children gets a greater remuneration than the married man with no children, or the single individual. It is no new principle that has been introduced. I do not wish to labour this subject. I have given reasons, generally, why the Government cannot accept the amendment. The principle upon which the Government&#39;s refusal is based is sound and should be generally acceptable to the commonsense of the community.

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh is to be commended for his thoughtful and logical speech upon this interesting subject. The speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is so much special pleading.  His  last observation relating to special allowances for children made under certain circumstances, is beside the question. Nobody cavils at that allowance or the principle upon which it is paid. The allowance is paid because the public servant has dependants in the shape of his family to maintain. That fact may be excluded as something irrelevant to the general principle of equal pay for equal service rendered to the community. The Commonwealth Government should, without inquiring any further, give an equal reward up to that point. Any other adjustments that follow by reason of family obligations should then be made, and not used as an excuse to violate the principle as laid down by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

                        <para>- I do. It is the unquestionable right of women to have equal remuneration with men for equal service. If there is to be any departure from that principle, clearly the burden of proof of the reason rests with those who allege it. The Prime Minister, in his short address, made, for his own purposes, a very convenient comparison of like with unlike. He compared by way of illustration the case of a man with a family with that of a woman without dependants. Might I suggest that a comparison should be made between a man with no dependants and a woman, though perhaps without children, with many dependants. It is nob in children alone that dependency consists. Very often a woman has as many dependants upon her industry as has a married man. I venture to say that there is scarcely an honorable member of this committee who cannot recall to his mind such instances. We are surrounded with them. It has been suggested, too, that if the principle of equal pay for equal work is applied, women will consequently be driven out of employment, because employers, finding that they have to pay equal remuneration, will make a choice favorable to men. That is the conclusion that one would expect to be arrived at by a Parliament consisting entirely of men. It is one so flattering to his self-esteem that the mere man naturally adopts that view. It is entirely to be expected that the Prime Minister, in the last resort, being a mere man, has adopted it as a conclusive argument. As one who has had some little experience in gauging the value of employment, I contend that in those classes of work which women perform side by side with men, the value of their services to their employer is at least equal to, if hot greater than, that of the service of the men themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have the endorsement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, because I know that he views this matter impartially. We may, therefore, confidently hope that, as women can perform certain services equally as well as men, they will be able bo hold their positions, and draw the emoluments to which they are unquestionably entitled. At all events, the argument of the Prime Minister should not weigh with a deliberate assembly such as this Parliament. If we make up our minds that equal pay for equal work is the correct principle, it should not be departed from. We should do the right thing, and scorn the consequences, and not pander in this Parliament to the worst elements among employers. We should legislate for a higher and better standard of employment, in the belief that we are passing laws which will be applied by fair-minded and honest employers outside. I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, and hope that it will be accepted by this committee. It is not a party matter, and calls for no division. I content myself with claiming the vote of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment, because I believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work. Women to-day play a large part in the public life of the community. Many of them attend our universities, and have proved themselves to be intellectual and capable of obtaining a thorough grasp of intricate subjects. Against strong opposition they have entered the medical and legal professions. In the various arts women have proved themselves to be mentally equal, if not superior, to men. It is only right that Parliament should endorse the principle of equal pay for equal work. A woman has to pay the same. price for commodities as a man. Tram, train, and boat fares are the same for both, as is also hotel accommodation. The Prime Minister, in opposing this principle, is acting on behalf of commercial interests who employ large numbers of women at low wages. It is strange to hear Ministers of the Crown objecting to paying women the same wage as men for similar work. When a new department is formed one of the first officers is a lady stenographer, who invariably does her work well. Women need a wage equal to that enjoyed by men for the same class of work, for they are obliged to spend much more than men on clothing. Female fashions change rapidly and are sometimes expensive, and that is good for . trade. It is necessary for women to be fashionable, otherwise they might just as well hide themselves in a brickyard. The Prime Minister did not adduce a single logical argument in support of his refusal to accept this principle. If the Government is to be a model employer, it should set an example to private employers in the great commercial houses and factories of our cities. The status of women workers has been greatly improved in recent years. I can remember the time when they were required to work for twelve months without any payment. For the second year they received the munificent salary of 2s. 6d. per week; but if they desired an increase in the following year they were promptly dismissed. The Labour party, from its earliest days, has agitated for improved conditions for women. At first we claimed a wage of 5s. a week for girls in their first year of apprenticeship, and compromised on 4s. Happily those days have long since passed, the whole world has progressed, and the whole fabric of our commercial and industrial life is better in consequence of the more reasonable conditions which women workers enjoy. Although the Prime Minister has refused to accept the proposed new clause, I feel confident that in his heart he agrees with it. If he has any desire to render a public service to this country which will not be  forgotten,  I urge him to agree to this proposal. If he does so, his name will be recorded among those of the great men of the nation. He will not then have any need to spend his time talking about political blackmail. </para>

                        <para>- I apologize, sir, if I have strayed from the point at issue. I desire to convert the Prime Minister to my views on this matter. It will not be long before women are elected to this Parliament. A fortnight ago I attended a political meeting in Sydney, which was addressed by women speakers. They complained bitterly of the ineffective action which the Government had taken to &#34; rescue the women who are believed to be held in captivity by the blacks, and said that it was high time that some women were elected to Parliament to watch the interests of their sex. They also spoke in favour of the principle of equal pay for equal work which we are now advocating. In days gone by men kept women at work in their business houses until 9 o&#39;clock on five nights of the week, and 12 o&#39;clock on the sixth night in order to show their authority. Although a measure of reform has been accomplished, there is plenty of room for further improvement. The adoption of the principle which we are advocating will not be long delayed if men of character and ability continue to advocate it, and this Parliament would set a fine example to private employers in Australia and throughout the world if it accepted it. Australia has been notable for many great moral and social reforms, and we now have an opportunity to add another  stone  to our temple of fame. If we were to adopt the principle, the sister dominions of the Empire would soon do likewise. </para>

                    <para>.- I thought at this stage in the history of Australia an amendment such as has been proposed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh would be unnecessary. There is general recognition of the- principle of equal pay for equal work. It is not suggested that the Government should pay more than work is worth. A private employer assesses&#34; certain occupations in his business as worth, say, &#163;250 per annum, and if he has two employees performing those duties, whether they be men or women, they receive the same salary. Similarly, in the Commonwealth Service payment should be assessed according to the value of the work, and not according to the sex of the employee. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The taxpayers recognize the fairness of the doctrine of equal pay for equal work which was laid down years ago by the Labour party. They do not desire women to receive less pay than men for the same class of work. It is, unfortunately, true that in the State and Federal Services the principle of equality does not uniformly apply. But the fault lies with the governments concerned and not with the people. I know of a position in the Tasmanian Public Service which was occupied for years by a male official who received a salary of about &#163;350 per annum. Upon his retirement owing to ill-health a woman was engaged to do the work, and although her immediate superior admitted that she was a better officer than her predecessor, she was paid only about &#163;250. I admit that the man had a record of long and meritorious service; nevertheless the discrimination in salary was distinctly unfair. The Federal Government should be a model employer ; service under it should be regarded as the blue riband of governmental employment, but in some respects the salaries in federal departments are lower than those in state departments. It is often said that women are constitutionally not as fit for some occupations as are men. I admit that that is so in regard to occupations that call for physical strength, but in some avocations which require intelligence, quickness of mind, and deftness of fingers, women have been proved by experience to be equal, if not superior, to men. Why, then, should they not receive equal pay ? A few days ago I received a letter from a woman in the Commonwealth Service who for some years has been doing work acknowledged to be equal in value to the work done by a man receiving practically the same pay, but under the reclassification her position is assessed at a value below that hitherto placed upon it.  Her  case is only typical of hundreds, and probably thousands of others, and it emphasizes the necessity for laying down, by statute the doctrine that, irrespective of sex, payment shall be according to the task performed. </para>

                        <para>- While the Labour party was in power the principle of equal pay for equal work was in operation. It was the Labour party that first asserted the principle, and it will continue to fight for it. Every labour organization with which. I &#39;have been associated supports the principle, and does not see in it any menace to the employment of men. The Labour party is prepared to establish in this democracy of ours equality of opportunity for all citizens. In this amendment we are merely asking that where women do the same work as men they shall receive the same remuneration. We are not, at this moment, asking that the basic wage for women shall be the same as the basic wage for men ; our request is only for the first instalment of a principle that we hope some day further to advance. But even that first instalment the Government refuses to concede.  Ministers have not advanced any arguments in justification of the evil practice that has grown up. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and my opinion of the Arbitrator has fallen considerably since I learned the method by which he arrives at a definition of &#34; remuneration,&#34; in assessing the value of services rendered to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister told us that the method adopted by the Arbitrator in assessing the remuneration to be paid is to first ascertain the cost of the ordinary necessaries of life, and then add a very moderate allowance for what are, in the opinion of the Arbitrator, luxuries and recreations - in other words, the employee must receive the bare amount necessary to support him and his family, and no more. That is the principle that the Prime Minister has said is followed by the Arbitrator. It is because it has been followed under the system of economics, endorsed by honorable members on the other side, that there is a great number of people in Australia to-day who say that the capitalist system must go, and that it will never bring satisfaction to the workers, since it will never give the wage-earners, no matter what the value of their product may be, more than sufficient to keep body and soul together. These people contend that the system gives the wage-earners just sufficient to keep them alive in the community, and capable of producing moTe of their kind to serve the capitalists. That opinion is held strongly by the section of the people, that is dissatisfied with the capitalist system. It is an argument that has been confirmed by the Prime Minister, and by interjections by honorable members opposite. Although, as a principle, it may be satisfactory for the purpose of fixing a basic wage, when applied to the fixing of rate3 of remuneration for services, it is entirely wrong. In that case the value of the services should be taken into account, and not merely the smallest amount upon which an individual can exist. The Prime Minister went on to tell us that in certain circumstances consideration is given to the fact that men are married and have families to support. We do not disagree with that practice, but we say that it represents another invidious distinction between men and women. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has mentioned that many cases come within the knowledge of honorable members of women who undertake the responsibility of supporting families. By very great self-denial they place on one side the opportunities they have of fulfilling the natural destiny of every woman by marrying and rearing families of their own, and unselfishly take on themselves the responsibility of providing for their younger brothers and sisters. That is a great and heroic work. </para>

                        <para>- If women were treated as fairly as married men, the Arbitrator would take such circumstances into consideration, and would award these women something more than is given to single women without dependants. Not the slightest regard, however, is paid to those circumstances. Why ? For no other reason than that these persons are women. Of reasons in support of the Government&#39;s policy honorable members opposite are destitute. They have been challenged to produce arguments, and not one of them has risen to do so. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> is quick to rise in defence of a man who is enjoying a salary of &#163;2,000 a year, but the principle of equality of opportunity for women finds him silent. Why? Again, because women and not highly-paid men are concerned. There are no arguments to support this vicious principle. </para>

If one went to a museum of economic antiquities one might find some of those arguments, but they are so old and musty that honorable members opposite are afraid to produce them. There was a time when they were used and accepted in the old world. That was a time in the early days of our industrial system, when women labour and child labour were exploited. Women and children were then forced to go into the industrial world and work for the lowest wages that would maintain bodily existence, without even decent bodily comfort. These were the days when children worked for ten or twelve hours a day, and were taught at night to put their hands together and say - </para>

The evil practice of unequal pay is to-day a phenomenon in the evolution of our industrial system. It remains, perhaps, because our political system has been slow to give political liberty and political rights to the women of our country, but during the last decade or two the women of Australia, and, to a certain extent, of other parts of the world, have obtained political rights. When they came into possession of them they found that they were under  great disabilities, very largely because men who held opinions akin to those expressed by interjection by honorable members opposite, had controlled legislation all over the world, and had entirely neglected to legislate for the interests of women. </para>

To-day the women of Australia are agitating, and they are so dissatisfied with the disabilities placed upon them, and with the refusal of the governing authorities to remove those disabilities, that they have joined in a great movement to be represented in Parliament. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> has said that there is not the slightest doubt that they will be in this Parliament shortly. </para>

                        <para>- I endorse that sentiment. When they come here they will insist upon their rights, of which this is one. We simply ask that when a woman does the same work as a man, she shall not be paid the left-handed compliment of being told, &#34; You do the same work as a man, but you shall receive less for it, because you are a woman.&#34; That is a form of economic slavery, and it arises only because woman, being physically the weaker vessel, is also politically the weaker vessel. But the day is coming when this wrong will be righted. It stands to the discredit of the Australian people, and the Australian Parliament, that the wrong is not already righted. We can very largely measure the progress of civilization in a people by the regard they pay to their women. These nations that have reached the highest eminence of civilization have always paid the greatest regard to their women. Let honorable members consider the race that we have dispossessed in Australia. While in some ways they profess, and, perhaps, show, some respect to their women, economically they treat them with about as much respect as honorable members opposite are prepared to show to the women of Australia to-day. When a tribe of aborigines moves from place to place, the big, strong, blackfellows carry nothing but spears, and they do nothing but call to the dogs; but the poor lubras carry every possession belonging to the tribe, because they are &#34; the weaker vessel.&#34; If we wish to show ourselves superior to them in our regard and respect for women in the economic sphere, we must no longer dispossess them of their rights. </para>

                        <para>- Women are the best judges of that, and they are not afraid of it. I am glad to learn by the interjection of the honorable member that he has at least one argument; but I can assure him that women are prepared to enter into competition with men in certain spheres of employment, to render service equal to that of men, and to take their chances side by side with men. I do not deplore the entrance of women into certain walks of life. Many men who are driving pens in our offices would be better off and healthier if they were guiding ploughs. The honorable member for Forrest will perhaps agree with that. </para>

                        <para>- All profiteers like piecework, for it enables the employers to avail themselves of the best services of men when they are in their prime. It is the law of the survival of the fittest. Honorable members opposite know that deputations from the women in the Public Service have repeatedly asked for equal pay for equal work) and I challenge them to prove that the argument in favour of the amendment is unsound. When I entered the employment of a firm in Adelaide over 35 years ago, there were no women employees, but at the present time the office is entirely staffed by women because it is cheaper to employ them than men. In the Commonwealth Bank and in all the commercial houses women are employed, not because of a philanthropic desire to give them work, but because their services are obtainable at a lower wage than men command. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The fact is that the employers are making extra profit by reason of the lower wages paid to them. Simply because this principle has not been embodied in past legislation there is no reason why it should not be included in the Public Service Act. To be just to the female section of the Public Service, the committee should accept the amendment. To refuse the request would be dishonorable. </para>

                        <para>.- I had not intended to speak on this subject, but I wish to make my attitude clear, since some of my interjections have been wrongly interpreted. In view of the fact that there is want of continuity in the services of women, the probability is that employers generally prefer to employ men. Married men, in particular, are better and steadier workers than women. If the principle of equal pay for equal work were accepted, no doubt the women would receive less employment than they do today, which might be a good thing for the country, as it would solve our domestic problem in Australia. From that point of view, the amendment might well be supported, but there is inconsistency in the arguments employed by honorable members opposite. If it were shown that a woman could render better service than a man, I do not suppose they would consent to her receiving a higher salary than a man. In fixing the basic wage for a working man we consider the needs of an employee with a wife and three children, but when it is suggested that a single man, who has not the same obligations as a married man, should  receive  less pay, to enable the latter man to be given a. higher salary, the argument is- raised that the same service is rendered in each case. I understand that members of the Opposition are bitterly opposed to piecework, which would enable the value pf the services rendered to be accurately appraised. It would be far more consistent if  honorable members opposite admitted the principle of piece-work. My objection to equal pay for equal work i3 that women do not give the same continuity of service as men, and they are mostly single persons without family obligations. The carrying of the amendment would mean the dismissal of about 50 per cent. of the women now employed. </para>

                    <para>.- I take advantage of the report stage to make a brief statement respecting appointments to the Public Service. It will be remembered that last night, on the second reading of this bill, I spoke on the same subject. I said that the days of political patronage were dead, that official and social influence had been substituted, and that there had been built up a gigantic official bureaucracy. The Prime Minister said that that was an obsession on my part. I furnished him with facts, which I thought supported my case, but he denied them. He said that I could have access to the official documents which would prove that I was wrong. Since then I have spent most of my time in examining the documents. I was first furnished in the early hours of the morning with a number of documents, but it did not take me long to discover that the file was incomplete. I cast no reflection on any one. I simply state the fact. One document in particular was missing. I was told it was somewhere else, and I must look somewhere else for it. I obtained it elsewhere. I obtained the whole of the documents available, but not the complete file. The whole of the testimonials were not there. It was imperative that I should have the whole of them for the purposes of comparison. However, from these documents I have been able to adduce a story. My statement last night was that men were appointed, not by reason of merit or seniority, but by a process of influential patronage. Whenever certain people outside desired positions inside the Service, openings were placed at their disposal. I made an attack, not upon individuals or appointments to the Service, but upon the method of appointment. I challenged the Government on two recent appointments. I quoted them to show that an injustice had been done to public servants, and that there was no remedy under the law.One of the gentlemen appointed was named Henderson. I have examined his qualifications, and they are of the highest character. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I do not question them. I am not the one to judge his ability, and I make no reflection upon this gentleman. But other applicants also possessed qualifications of great merit. Apart from Henderson&#39;s qualifications, I draw attention to the method of his appointment. This young man displayed brilliant ability while in Paris. He went to the war, and played a part in this country&#39;s history. He was ambitious. He visited London, and gave his address as 18, Rue  Matignon  Paris. He was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Lucas, the Agent-General for South Australia, in London, to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook. Henderson said: &#34;I am a man with talent and qualifications, and I should like to place them at the disposal of my country. I am an Australian, and I should like to be appointed to the department of External Affairs.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook said, &#34; I will introduce you to the man who can get you there.&#34; He introduced Henderson to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> Leeper, an able man, but not an officer of the Commonwealth Service. He is an Australian employed in the service of the British Government. Henderson placed his testimonials and qualifications before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leeper.</inline> Both these gentlemen subsequently left for Australia by different boats. On the 24th July a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice was issued calling for applications for these positions. The  next  day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> Leeper was in attendance at the Prime Minister&#39;s department. He wrote on the official paper of the Prime Minister&#39;s department an application on behalf of Henderson, and passed it in. Applications closed on the 7th August, and there was no knowledge of the whereabouts of Henderson. He did not apply personally, and apparently knew nothing about the position. On the 23rd August, the Secretary to the Public Service Commissioner telegraphed to the inspector at Adelaide, asking if he had heard anything of Henderson, who was said to be in that city, and asking him to try to locate him, because he was an applicant for the position. The inspector replied on the 26th August that Henderson was in Melbourne and that he had heard that he intended to call on the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Deane. General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White,  chairman  of the Public </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Service Board, became anxious about the whereabouts of Henderson.  The duty of the head of the Public Service Board is to exercise impartiality in Public Service appointments. It is not within his province to favour one applicant more than another - to act as an attendant on or caretaker of any applicant - and yet he was anxious to know the whereabouts of Henderson. He interviewed the Secretary of the Prime Minister regarding Henderson, and minuted a paper that up to 2.40 p.m. on that day Henderson had riot called. It was very important that he should call. On the 27th August Henderson called upon General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White with a. letter of introduction from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Deane. No doubt General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White said to him, &#34; My dear friend, we have found a position for you, and we think it is only right that you should accept it.&#34; Note what happened. In this case it was not even necessary for the man to apply; his friends put in an application for him. S&#39;o much for that case. </para>
                <para>The other appointment was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Casey. I make no reflection upon that gentleman either. What were the qualifications for the appointment? The successful applicant had to comply with certain conditions. First of all he had to be a bachelor of arts; secondly, a - bachelor of laws; thirdly, to have a knowledge of constitutional history; and fourthly, a knowledge of constitutional law. It was also desirable that he should have an acquaintance with international affairs, and it was preferred that the candidate should have some knowledge of one or more European languages. I shall now show to what extent the application of R. G. Casey complied with those conditions. Apart from his military experience, he is a. B.A., Cambridge, with honours degree in 1913; M.A. in 1917 ; good knowledge of French, some knowledge of German. He is well acquainted with the general conditions of Australia, was resident in England for five years, and has visited various countries. There is no reference in his application to a knowledge on his part of either constitutional history or constitutional law, yet those two subjects were laid down as essential qualifications for the position.. The Prime Minister asked me to select one or two of the other applications for purposes of comparison, and I propose to use one or two of therm. Here is an application from one gentleman. It will . be remembered by honorable members that when the Prime Minister was replying to me last evening another honorable gentleman in this- chamber thought fit to interject.His ambitions are not in this chamber; they are elsewhere. High Court judge-ships, which are not to be ignored, are at the disposal of the Government, and may be given to any of its friends who are not too critical. But is a gentleman who may aspire to occupy a position on the High Court bench to assume that an accused person is guilty before- the evidence on both sides has been given, or is such a person to be denied the right of appeal? The right of appeal is one of the fundamental principles of the laws of this country. </para>

                <para>I propose now to discuss for a few moments the advertisements which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> calling for applications for these positions. The first advertisement appeared on the 24th July, and, according to it, the positions were open only to persons in the Service, but the second advertisement, which appeared a week later, made the positions available to any one inside or outside the Service. I submit that that was not fair to the officers of our Service. Section 47 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which deals with the appointment of persons from outside the Service, reads - </para>

                        <para>If at any time in any special case it appears expedient or desirable in the public interest to appoint to a division other than the Fourth Division some person who is not in the Commonwealth Service, and who is not eligible under the conditions otherwise prescribed for admission to the Commonwealth Service, the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the board upon report from the permanent head, appoint such person accordingly without examination and, if the Governor-General thinks fit, without probation. </para>

                        <para>No such appointment shall be made until the board has certified that in its opinion there is no officer available in the Commonwealth Service who is as capable of filling the position to which it is proposed that the appointment shall be made. A copy of every recommendation, report, and certificate under this section shall, within fourteen days after the making of the appointment, be laid before both Houses of Parliament if the Parliament is then sitting, or, if not, then within seven days of the next meeting of the Parliament. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para class="block">It is clear, therefore, that before any one outside the Service is appointed to a position within the Service, the possibilities of securing a person in the Service capable of performing the required duties must be exhausted, and only after every effort has been made, but without success, to obtain a qualified man within the Service, is the Government justified in appointing an outsider. The Government did not give effect to that section in making these appointments. What it did do was to invite applications from persons inside and outside of the Service, select the person outside the Service whom it desired to appoint, and then obtain a certificate in accordance with the terms of the section,, that no officers available in the Service were capable&#39; of filling the position. When I mentioned this matter last night I thought that the Prime Minister had nothing to do with the making of the appointments, and, by interjection, I said that I did not blame him, and that there was no need for him to defend the persons who were responsible; but I have since learned that he had a very good reason for his remarks, for I discovered in the files a letter which he wrote to General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White in regard to the matter. It seems to suggest that, although General White was prepared to give effect to the provisions of section 47, which I have quoted, the Prime Minister was not willing to permit him <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do sp. The letter reads-- </para>
                <para class="block">Dear General White, </para>
                <para>In regard to positions &#39;1 and 2, senior clerk in Melbourne and London respectively, it was particularly desired, that the two senior positions should be open to applicants from outside the Service. I understand, however, that the manner in which the advertisement has been framed in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> precludes this, and I, shall be glad if you will kindly, take the necessary action to ensure that the positions in question should be so advertised that persons from outside the Service will be eligible for. appointment. </para>
                <para>I am informed that the range , of salary of: position No. 3, clerk, Melbourne, was altered from &#163;660-&#163;756 to &#163;528-&#163;588. In this connexion I might mention that the salary stipulated in my communication represented not only my considered opinion - after I had gone into the matter very fully in consultation with the Attorney-General and the Secretory, Attorney-General&#39;s Department - but was, I am given to understand, that originally suggested by you, and I shall be glad if you will kindly let me know why you consider such a material, reduction necessary. </para>
                <para class="block">I understood that the Public Service Board was established in order to free the Service of all external influence - social, political, or other. No member of this Parliament should have rights and privileges that are denied to another. What would have happened had I communicated with General White in regard to proposed appointments, or submitted a testimonial in favour of any applicant? The letter I have just read appears on the file. I am told that it was not sent, that somebody whispered that it would be inadvisable to send, it, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Strachan</inline> communicated the purport of it to General White through the telephone. Whether that was done or the letter was actually sent I do not know, but whatever method of conveying the views of the Prime Minister was adopted, it is significant that the wording of the advertisement was altered immediately so that applications could be received from persons both within and without the Service. Thus the way was opened for the appointment of a gentleman who had not even applied, whose application had&#34; been written out for him by somebody else, and who was not aware that he was a candidate until the applications had closed on the 7th August. Apparently nothing was done for a month, but on the 8th September the Prime Minister and General White held a meeting at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Deane, the secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, was also present. There are no records or minutes of the meeting, and what happened there can be only guessed from subsequent proceedings. On the 9th September General White sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> a list of applicants with a request that he should report upon &#39;them in accordance with section 47 of the act, which provides that an outsider may be appointed to the Service &#34; On the recommendation of the board upon report from the permanent head.&#34; Apparently the permanent head of the. Prime Minister&#39;s Department refused to report, and returned the applications without comment. So far as the documents show, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> never reported upon them. On the 11th  September General White advised that Henderson and Casey should be recommended for appointment. On the following day the board recommended those two gentlemen, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clements</inline> informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> accordingly. On the 16th September the Prime Minister signed the recommendation for the appointments, and on the 19th General White sent this minute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> - </para>

                <para class="block">The selection &#34; agreed upon &#34; ! Who had agreed upon it ? The Prime Minister and General White. When? On 8th September. Apparently the Prime Minister and General White agreed, without a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> that Casey and Henderson should be appointed and that the other applicants, should be turned down, and on 16th September the board was called together to go through the formality of signing up something which had been previously agreed upon. On the 19th <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> was asked to concur in the appointments in accordance with section 47. There is no reference in that section to concurrence; it merely provides that the appointment shall be made on the recommendation of the board upon report from the permanent head. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> made no report, but the communication from General White dragged from him on the 22nd September the words, &#34; I concur.&#34;  That is alleged to be a compliance with the law. I am told also that the recent appointment of the Australian Commissioner in America was made subject to the condition that the person appointed should take with him another Casey, who also desired to gain diplomatic experience. If the facts I have related to-night do not justify every statement I made yesterday, I do not know what would. There is a widespread unrest throughout the Public Service. We cannot expect efficiency and contentment if men who having devoted themselves to self-improvement in the hope that when vacancies occur they will have an opportunity of promotion, learn that the appointments are &#34; cut and dried &#34; for outsiders who are backed by social influence. The average member of the Public Service does not get a fair deal, and there can never be that confidence which is essential to a contented service until a man who knows that he has seniority, and merit and qualifications equal to those of other applicants, who have been preferred, can go before an impartial tribunal, composed, not of the men who perpetrated the injustice, but of independent men, who will go into his case and give a verdict that shall stand,-&#39; against any attempt by the board to deprive him of the fruits of his victory. . </para>

                    <para>. - Although the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> has spoken at considerable length upon the appointments to the External Affairs Branch of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, only two points require consideration, namely  - -(1) were  the appointees suitable persons? and (2) was there any irregularity or impropriety in the method of appointment? Upon both those points the honorable member&#39;s charges fail. I think the honorable member agreed that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> has considerable qualifications for the position to which he has been appointed, and those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> are not such as to make his appointment unwarranted; in fact when they were shown to me at my interview with General White they certainly impressed me as first class, and eminently fitting the applicant for one of the vacant positions. But, in addition to the paper credentials, regard must be had to the personality of the individual. The applicants were interviewed by the board, and after giving consideration to their qualifications, personalities, and general suitability for the positions, a decision in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> was arrived at. -I think that had the honorable member for &#34;Bourke found that the testimonials of those applicants did not indicate unfitness for the positions for which they were candidates, and had by a personal interview satisfied himself that they possessed also the requisite qualities of character and personality, he would have considered it perfectly right and proper to appoint them. The next consideration is whether there was any impropriety in the method of appointment. The honorable member for Bourke has pointed out that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> first indicated his desire to join the Commonwealth Public Service when he visited <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook in London. No doubt, on that occasion he explained his qualifications and the fact that he had been for some time educating himself in Paris, had taken a degree at the Paris university, and spoke French like a Frenchman. Up to that time the Government had not made up its mind regarding the appointment of two clerks to the External Affairs branch, but it had invoked the assistance of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, who had placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth a member of the Foreign Office staff, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> Leeper, who was about to proceed to Australia on loan for a period of six months. Until it was mentioned by the honorable member for Bourke, I was unaware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leeper</inline> had met <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> in London; but I suggest .that nothing could have been more natural than that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook should introduce <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Henderson</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leeper,</inline> who was engaged in the very service for which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Henderson</inline> believed himself to be peculiarly qualified. The honorable member appeared to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook had pursued an extraordinary course. I consider that he did the most natural and obvious thing in the circumstances. The Government subsequently made up its mind to appoint two clerks with special qualifications, one of whom should remain in Australia and attend primarily to matters connected with the League of Nations. I thereupon communicated to General White, the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board, at an interview, what the Government proposed to do, and discussed with him the salaries that would be required to be offered in order to attract the right type of applicants. That was an obvious &#39; and necessary course.. The Government did not exercise its power to make appointments by order in council. It followed the ordinary course of inviting the Public Service Board to obtain persons to fill certain positions. Before the Public Service Board could advertise <inline font-style="italic">th&#38;</inline> scale of salaries for the appointees, it is obvious that the Prime Minister had to convey to the board the nature of the duties that would have to be performed, and to discuss with the board the salaries that it would be necessary to pay to obtain the persons of the type required. At that interview I discussed the matter with General White, and my recollection is that he said that the Public Service Board would probably consider the two senior clerks&#39; positions as being worth from &#163;800 to &#163;900. The figure for the third position I have forgotten, but my recollection is that it was about &#163;700 or &#163;750. It appeared to me that those figures would probably command the services of men of the type required. The next stage was that the Public Service Board, in the ordinary course, had to advertise the positions in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> I have no distinct recollection of what arose when the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice appeared, but I do remember that it was brought under my notice that the positions were advertised as being open only to members of the Public Service. At my conference with General White it was decided that, as the positions were of paramount importance to Australia - and I suggest that a very great deal will hang upon the suitability in particular of the appointee to London, who will have to create a <inline font-style="italic">liaison</inline> with the British Foreign Office - it was desirable to invite applications from the whole of Australia. I remind the House that it is not provided in any regulation or law of this country that a position in the Public Service must be given to any member of the Service who is capable of performing the duties of the position. A member of the Public Service who is appointed has to be as capable as any one else whose services can- be obtained. There is a distinction between a person who is capable and one who is a3 capable as any one whose services can be obtained. When the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice was published my recollection is that the Secretary of the Department drew my attention to the fact that applications were restricted to the Public Service. Some communication was made to the Public Service Board - whether by letter, telephone, or messenger, I have no knowledge! - and as a result of it the advertisement was altered. When I was speaking last night I had no recollection of those circumstances, or of how or when the advertisement was altered. I was advised that there was a clerical error, and that statement is now confirmed by the fact that it was not a week later, but the next day, when the correction was made. When the error was discovered a white slip was issued setting out the proviso that the positions were open to applicants from both within and without the Public Service. The <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> is published, I think, on Thursdays, and these white slips are sent to the departments on the following Saturday. The departments, I understand, work on the white slips. The error in the original notice was corrected within twenty hours of its appearance, and it must have been within the knowledge of all applicants inside the Service that the positions were open to applicants from outside the Service. As to the influence exerted on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson&#39;s</inline> behalf, I had no knowledge of it. When the applications  had been determined I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson&#39;s</inline> application, and considered his qualifications.  His  application was certainly made by himself. I remember that when the Public Service Board was endeavouring to fill the positions the  chairman  of it told me that they had received a most promising application, that the qualifications of the applicant appeared to be extraordinarily good, but that the important detail of his age was missing, and that they were most desirous of obtaining further information about him. It was discovered that the applicant, Henderson, was an Australian / who was formerly in the South Australian Public Service. He had been in France for some years, had returned to Australia, and had appeared on the scene about that time. The board saw him, found that his age was satisfactory, and ascertained that his qualifications were as set out in his application. It came to the conclusion that he was the most suitable person for the appointment, and he was accordingly appointed. There is nothing in the procedure adopted to which any one can take exception. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey&#39;s</inline> application was sent in and considered by the board, </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Ifr <inline font-style="italic">Bruce.</inline> which came to the conclusion that he was the most suitable person to appoint to one of the other positions. Something has been said about the non-concurrence of the permanent head of the department. There can be nothing in that suggestion, because the permanent head of the department was in touch with the Public Service Board during the whole time that the applications were under consideration. The greatest importance was attached to these positions by me, and by the secretary of the department, and I think that we had impressed the Public Service Board with our ideas. I say most emphatically that the permanent head of the department knew what was taking place. He knew who the applicants were, and the two who were appointed were certainly appointed with his concurrence. I understand that the Acting Leader of the Opposition read a letter in which the permanent head of the department said, in effect, that he concurred in the appointment. The honorable member stressed certain dates, and said that the concurrence was given on a wrong date, at a wrong time, and in wrong sequence. I can assure the House, from my personal knowledge of what took place, and from what the secretary of the department has told me, that not the slightest importance can. be attached to those dates, because throughout the proceedings the Public Service Board was in close touch with the secretary of the department. It was suggested that a condition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elder&#39;s</inline> appointment as Trade Commissioner for Australia in America was that he should take a brother of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> with him as his secretary. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elder</inline> had been appointed Commissioner in America he came to me, and, after we had discussed his staff in America, he asked me whether there would be any objection to his taking a private secretary with him. I said that there would be no objection provided the Commonwealth Government did not have to pay for it. He replied that the Commonwealth Government would not have to pay anything. I understand that he took a brother of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> with him as private secretary. In fairness to the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> concerned in the American adventure, I should state that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elder</inline> bold me that he would be paid nothing, but was going at his own expense, because he desired to gain experience, with a view to assisting his country in a public capacity. The other case we have been discussing is that of the other <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> and there has been a suggestion that he has been striving to obtain the position for an ulterior purpose. I understand that the statement made last night by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> is a man of considerable means, is accurate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> applied for the position because he thought he would be able to render some service to Australia. It is only fair to the Messrs. Casey concerned to make these facts clear.I can see nothing substantial in the case put forward by the Acting Leader of the Opposition this evening. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has reminded me of that point. I saw General White on various dates, but I cannot say whether I saw him on the 8th September or any other specified date. I saw him at the outset to explain to him the nature of the positions that the Government desired to create, and I saw him on a subsequent date, which may have been the date mentioned by the honorable gentleman. He then indicated to me the progress that had been made in the selection of applicants; told me of the number of applications received; and intimated to me that there was a large number of them, and that they were of a first class character. He added that there was great difficulty in determining which of the applicants were the most suitable. That is what happened as between General White and me. I certainly consulted with General White on two occasions regarding these positions. I think the House will see that the Public Service Board and the Secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department behaved throughout these transactions with the utmost propriety. The Public Service Board exercised its discretion in making these appointments after fully considering the qualifications of the applicants, their personalities, and their general fitness and suitability. </para>

                        <para>, - I desire to take this opportunity of mentioning a matter that is of the utmost importance to 800 or 900 people in my electorate. In answer to questions asked by me in the House, misleading information has been unwittingly supplied in regard to the wages paid to the employees at the metal works at Port Kembla. I inquired whether the Metal Manufacturing Company was deliberately reducing its output, and whether the Postal Department had had to import a lot of material from overseas. The Minister representing the Postmaster-General informed me that the company . was producing to the utmost of its capacity, but I have a correspondence from the secretary of the industrial organization concerned to the effect that the telephone cable factory is working at only one-third of its capacity, and that last month 27 more men were dismissed from that factory. I venture to say that if an impartial inquiry is held, the statement of the  union will be proved up to the hilt. Although the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> no doubt stated in good faith that the company was paying the award rates of wages, I point out that, although this industry is one of the most highly protected in Australia, the company, by reason of its exemption from the operation of the federal award, pays wages as much as &#163;1 a week less in some cases than are paid in other industries. Furthermore, the men are deprived of six days&#39; sick pay a year, and of payment for holidays. That is my comment on the answer given to my question regarding the wages of timber workers. The conditions are equally as bad in the case of the metal workers and the general employees of the company. The position is made clear in the following communication that has been addressed to me : - </para>

                        <para>One of the reasons for the turmoil is the insatiable demands made by the company for more, and still more production, and to entice the employees to that end, an extra pittance to their meagre dole &#39;in what is called a bonus, is dangled before them from month to month provided they reach a certain task. When the employee reaches a high state of efficiency, this bonus is reduced without reference to the workers themselves, the company claiming the right to do this at any time, so that at end of each month, when the employee goes to collect his bonus, it may be less than the rate paid the previous month. The management have absolutely refused to give to the Australian Workers Union a copy of the bonus rates. </para>
                        <para>The company- deny the union officials the right to negotiate in disputes arising out of the bonus; consequently, this is one of the prolific sources of the trouble. Another matter that assists to keep&#39; the cauldron at boiling point is the fact that men are dismissed on the flimsiest pretext, henceforth dismissals are not to be questioned, for here again the union officials have been told that their intervention will not be permitted; consequently, if the workmates of a dismissed man think he has been unjustly dealt with, they will down-tools as heretofore, and the job will again bc held up. </para>
                        <para>A long outstanding complaint, and one that the union have vainly tried to remedy is the fact that these works are manned by skilled labourers, and that the margins paid above the basic wage are so microscopic that it can be said that the work is carried out by skilled men for the unskilled wage, 90 per cent, of the employees receiving not more than 14s. 2d. per day. </para>
                        <para>These wages were fixed at the inception of the works by the court when the industry was in its infancy, and when it was necessary to give the industry time to settle. It has settled, and is making huge dividends, and is coddled to the extent of an excessively high tariff operating in Australia. The men&#39;s wages are also settled, well settled, for there has been no move since the start, notwithstanding frequent appeals to the court. </para>
                        <para>That this company can well afford to pay decent wages cannot be disputed, as witness the fallowing figures. From 31st March, 1980, to March, 1923, it declared dividends to the amount of &#163;123,365. . The undistributed profits were &#163;5,900, and the liquid assets, after allowing for liabilities, &#163;187,142. These sums total &#163;337,607, and as the called-up capital from 31st March, 1923, was &#163;337,500, it will be seen that this company is in a particularly favorable position. </para>
                        <para class="block">The men claim that they can prove that this company is a pup of the British Insulation and Helesby Company, of England, and that its output is being deliberately retarded to keep up prices. The company has informed the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department that it cannot fulfill all its requirements, and this is used as an excuse for charging high prices for its manufactures. The profits are distributed between the parent company in Britain and the Port Kembla company. The company employs nothing like the number of men that should be employed in an industry of this kind. It is not paying the ruling rates of wages for highly-skilled labour. The timber workers there have never received the federal award applying to other companies that were cited before the court. This company was cited but applied for an exemption and obtained it. The two Government departments concerned, the Customs Department and the Postal Department, should take steps to force this company to work under the same conditions as other companies employing men of similar trades. I refer particularly to the timber workers and the trades incidental to the manufacture of metal goods. I am satisfied that if an inquiry were held respecting the operations of this company, it would be proved to the satisfaction of both Ministers, that- the company is not acting fairly to its men, and has given misleading information to the department. It has stated that it is working at full output, yet it is only producing one-third of its possible output. </para>

                        <para>, -  The honorable member for Werriwa suggests that misleading statements have been made to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, but that no blame is attachable to that department for any action it has taken. This is the first company -of its kind to be established in Australia, and it is only fair to the Metal Manufacturers Limited that I should give the House particulars of its history. Towards the end of April,  1923,  an inspection was made- of the work in progress on the construction of the new cable factory at Port Kembla, and an examination was made of the extent of the plant and its output,, which was then being laid down. As a result of this inspection, it was estimated that, if all went well in completing the installation and with subsequent operations on actual manufacturing processes, the firm would be capable of supplying various types of lead-covered paper core cable, aggregating  51,500  loop miles of conductor. The firm had tendered for the supply of cables to meet the department&#39;s needs during  1923-4,  and, after further consultation with the managing director of the company, an order was placed for a number of types of cable in excess of that pre&#39;viously contemplated,, namely, cable aggregating  62,800  loop miles, representing an excess of  11,300  loop miles above the capacity estimated by the post office representative who inspected the factory. Towards the end of September it was clear that the company could not meet the department&#39;s requirements, and, at the company&#39;s request, following on representations as to the urgent, nature of the post office requirements, a portion of the order which had been placed in Australia was transferred overseas, to the extent of approximately  12,000  loop miles of conductor, leaving the company to complete the manufacture of cabin aggregating approximately  51,000  miles of loop conductor. The honorable member has Stated that the company is working eight hours a day instead of  24,  but it is not the duty of this department to Bay that it should work  24  hours.&#39; That is the company&#39;s own responsibility, and it is its own lookout if it works one shift instead of three. It will be seen that the order transferred &#39; was almost exactly the excess of the total order placed,&#39;, above the figure which had been&#39; estimated by the post office representative as the capacity of the factory. During the year  1923-4  the department&#39;s operations were seriously hindered because of difficulty in securing necessary supplies of particular, types of cable. The honorable member will recognize that the company set to work to manufacture certain types of cable by mass production, and to this end diverted their employees from other works. It was therefore necessary for the department to import a quantity of cable. </para>

                    <para class="block">Tenders for the supply of lead-covered paper core cable to meet the requirements of 1924-5 were invited on the 7th February, 1924, and&#39; the Australian contractors tendered for the supply of certain types only - the loop mileage required by the department in respect of these types aggregating 90,235 miles. In considering the order which was to be given to Metal Manufacturers Limited, the quantities were based on the maximum output of cable which previous experience had shown might be anticipated, the figure arrived at in respect of the various types totalling 59,699 loop miles. The balance of cable of the types in question ordered overseas represented 30,536 loop miles, and of this quantity there were 20,079 loop miles of conductor in respect of one of the largest types of cable used &#39; up to date in the Australian service, namely, 800 pairs. This class of cable had not previously been manufactured in Australia, and apart from the fact that the order given was considered almost equivalent to the output of the factory, it did not seem wise to incur the risk of failure until experience had been gained as to the company&#39;s ability to manufacture the larger types. In respect of 600 pair and 500 pair cable, which had not hitherto been made it the Fort Kembla factory, 11,828 loop miles were required, and in order that the company might gain experience in the heavier class of work, cables of this type aggregating 8,057 loop miles of conductor was ordered from them, leaving a balance of only 3,771 miles to be placed overseas, as a guarantee against serious embarrassment arising on post office work in case there should be a failure in the manufacturing processes at the Fort Kembla factory. It has been gratifying that the cable manufactured at Port Kembla has been in all respects thoroughly satisfactory, and there is now no reason to doubt the ability of those concerned to meet the department&#39;s requirements in respect of the larger type of cable. Analyzing the financial aspect of these transactions, Metal Manufacturers Limited received orders for the types of cable under consideration of a total cost of &#163;258,334, and the overseas proportion amounted to &#163;97,628. Included in the latter figure is the value of the 800 pair cable which the department did not deem it wise in any circumstances to order at that time from the Port Kembla factory, and the value concerned was &#163;56,968, leaving a net sum of &#163;40,660 in respect of cable for which Metal Manufacturers had tendered, but for which it was not anticipated that deliveries could be effected within the time required by the department. The balance of cable required by the post office for the current year, and in respect of which no tenders were received from Metal Manufacturers, was placed overseas at a total value of &#163;36,807. The honorable member will see clearly that the metal manufacturing company is doing, its best to supply the requirements of Australia. The rate of wages paid is the responsibility of the company, and not of the department. We are getting great satisfaction from the company, and it is a fine thing for us that this industry has been able to meet so much of the requirements of tha post office. </para>
