            <para>- My attention has not been called to the paragraph to which the honorable member refers, but I would remind- him that the regulations applying to British shipping generally in American ports, and to the carriage of liquors in bond into those ports, were very fully considered at the Imperial Conference. The very difficult situation which has arisen because of action taken in American Courts with regard to liquor on British ships was, I think, completely overcome by the arrangement now made for the extension of the limit of territorial waters to 12 instead of 3 miles. I can assure the honorable member that the whole question is very much in our minds, and in the minds of the members of the British Government also. </para>

If so, is the Prime Minister in a position to make a statement concerning the action of the British Government, and will he give this House an opportunity to discuss this very antiImperial decision? </para>

If honorable -members opposite have any knowledge of the enactments of this Parliament a couple of years ago, they will realize that the Government is confronted with difficulties in connexion with this matter.

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Act to give the concessions for whicli wc ask. I shall give a short history of the decisions of the House in connexion with the duty on wire netting. When the Tariff was being considered in this Chamber, I moved that British wire netting should be admitted into Australia free, and that we should pay a bounty to Australian manufacturers of wire netting to enable them to compete with the British manufacturers. I received a good deal of support. Six of the members of the present Government voted for free netting. Ono of my most ardent supporters was the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman).</inline> He realized how important it was that wire netting should be made available to the producers. He said on that occasion that we should never lose sight of the fact that the rabbit is the greatest curse Australia has experienced. He also said that unless we had a prosperous and contented yeomanry the industries of Australia must suffer, and we should have grass growing in the main streets of our cities. I ask honorable members opposite to reflect on those words. It is a fact that if we do not look after the interests of the men in the back country we may find  gras3  growing in our city streets. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman also said that my arguments were an appeal to common sense.- I hope that he will feel to-day that my arguments are an appeal to his common sense and to that of the Government. I trust that other honorable members will feel that I am using common-sense arguments. Unfortunately the majority of the House voted against free netting. Afterwards the Government were induced to bring forward &#60;a proposal for free importation of wire netting from Great Britain, a 10 per cent, duty on foreign netting, and a bounty for local manufacture. I am sorry that members of this party received that measure in the spirit they did. I can say on behalf of the producers of the country that they appreciated that action of the Government. But the Customs Department have kept on taking advantage of the provisions of what we know as the Anti-Dumping Act, but which  i3  on our statute-book as the Australian Industries Preservation Act. That Act should not be allowed to remain on the statute-book for a single moment longer. It is the most preposterous and easily-  abused enactment on our statute-book. Honorable members always contend that Parliament should be supreme, and I 3ay that no Minister should be able to alter the Tariff at his own sweet will. When Parliament fixes a Tariff the Minister should be obliged to give effect to it. In December of 1922, after Parliament had declared that British wire netting should be free of duty, some consignments of netting came to Western Australia from Great Britain.. The circumstances respecting one small consignment came under my notice. That parcel was valued at &#163;113. The Customs Department put a duty of &#163;45, or nearly 40 per cent., on the consignment. They said that the home consumption price of the netting was &#34;&#163;158, and that therefore they must put a &#163;45 duty on it. In consequence of representations made to the Minister for Customs, he ordered that the duty should be refunded, and that a dumping duty should not be imposed on British, netting. In April of the next year, something of a like nature happened, and again we got the Government to remit the duty! All through the Tariff debates in this House it was clearly shown to be essential to Australia&#39;s best interests that wire netting should be made available to the producers at the cheapest possible price. Figures quoted revealed that huge sums of money had been spent by both the State and private individuals in purchasing wire  neeting.  In Western Australia alone we have a fence which runs from the south, near Esperance, to the north, at Port Hedland. That fence and subsidiary fences cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Their up-keep cost alone is enormous. A photograph printed in one of the Perth Sunday newspapers last week showed a number of men returning from a morning&#39;s shooting tour in good wheatgrowing; country which had vermin -proof fences on either side. These men had 86 rabbits between them. I know, of course, that there are places in which millions of rabbits collect, but the country to which I have referred is good wool and wheatgrowing country, between two wire-netted fences. </para>

          <para class="block">They have hundreds of miles of wirenetting fences. I was shown one plan which gave the position of a fence 400 miles long. It runs between New South Wales and South Australia, and is 5 ft. 6 in. or 6 ft. high. That indicates the enormous expense which these fences involve. I ask honorable members to read the speech made by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)&#34;</inline> in the debate on the Tariff. He showed that tens of millions of money had been expended and lost in Victoria and New South Wales through the ravages of the rabbits. He also quoted statistics to show that a rabbit industry had been built up in Australia. The greatest curse of Australia has been made the basis of an industry. I think he said that over &#163;1,000,000 worth of rabbit skins had been exported in. one year. Australia has two. great industries - wool and wheat, but she also has two curses - rabbits and dogs. A paragraph which appeared a few days ago in one of the morning newspapers stated that quite a large number of men had gone out night after night, and day after day, at a place in New South Wales to catch one dog, which had killed some hundreds of sheep. These losses surely show how necessary it is that cheap wire netting should . be made available to the producers. I wish to discuss the reasons which caused the Government to take the action they have taken; and I shall ask them to look at this question from a different aspect from that from which it has been viewed so far. I understand that the Minister for Customs has declared that the Act which he is administering is so specific that it leaves him no option but to do as he has done. He says that when it has been pointed out to him that netting has been sold for export to Australia at a lower price than it is sold for use in England, he must put into effect the dumping sections of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. I hold, first, that that is not the case. Parliament having declared, by a special vote, that British wire netting should bc admitted free, it should be so admitted. Of course, the Minister has certain duties under the Anti-Dumping Act, and he must discharge them. If persons elsewhere manufacture goods in quantities beyond the capacity of the home market to absorb; and sell the surplus cheaper in this country, action must be taken to protect our manufacturers. I am not in sympathy with any movement for assisting the dumper. But to assume that dumping of wire netting is taking place within the meaning of the Act is absurd. The position of the wire netting manufacturers in Great Britain to-day is comparable with that of a large businesshouse which does both a wholesale and a retail trade, charging different prices for wholesale and retailpurposes. The Act says thatthe Department must find out, first, whether goods are being sold more cheaply in Australia than for home consumption. I assume that the information an the possession of the Customs Department is to the effect that wire netting is being sold more cheaply in Australia than in the Old Gauntry. English manufacturerstake 65 per cent. off their list prices for consumption in England, and 70 per cent., plus 21/2 percent. for export to Australia. Therefore, they are selling netting cheaper for exportto Australia than forhome consumption. Forthepurposeof complying with the Act, however., the Minister has to consider the &#34; fair market value &#34; of the goods. The Act says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The &#34;Fair MarketValue &#34; of goodsmeans the fair market value of the goods, or of goods of the same class or kind, sold in the country of export in relation to which the expression is used,for home consumption in the usual and ordinary course of trade. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no &#34; ordinary course of trade &#34; in wire netting in the Old Country. A little netting may be sold for the manufacture of bird cages and trap s for rats and other pests, Tout the trade in it is almost entirely an export trade. An amusing incident occurred some time ago.. A man ordered in England some &#34; squizzers,&#34; which are toys used at entertainments, and found that the Customs Department classified them as &#34; musical instruments.&#34; The Department is handling wire netting in an equally absurd way. There is nothing like a wholesale trade in wire netting in England. The quantity used in that country is almost negligible. I believe the Department hasbeen advised that a large amount of it is consumed in Great Britain. Can any one confirm that statement? Has any one seen that netting in use? I have made careful inquiries with a view to testing the accuracy of the statement, but have not been able to discover where the netting is used. Has any one seen the countless miles of wire netting fences that must exist in England if thestatement be true ? Other kinds of netting may be used in that country for thepurpose of reinf orcing concrete roads, but they do not come within the same category as netting for fencing. Apart from the fact that the consumption of wirenetting in England is very small, this House was given clearly to understand that the powers of the Minister under the Act were not mandatory. Questions were asked on this point when the Bill for the Act was before us. I take -the following extract from <inline font-style="italic">Mansard: -</inline></para>

          <para class="block">The Minister must be satisfied, first, that there is a legitimate home trade in wire netting.I contend that there is no such trade. Thedemand forwire netting in England is sosmall that it is negligible in relation to prices. Netting is sold there a few coilsor a few yards at atime. In Australia the demand is for hundreds of miles. Certain phases of this question which have been brought under my notice have not yet beenplaced before the Minister. I wish to quote from a letter written by one of the biggest Arms in Australia,upon whose truthfulness I feel I can implicitly rely,although I admit that their knowledge ofthe facts may not be complete. The letter shows, first, that there is a large demand fornetting in Australia ; secondly,that the priceof English netting atthetime the letterwas written was higherthanthat of netting in Australia.; and,thirdly, that the Australian -manufacturer was notable to execute the ordersofferedto him. The letter, which deals with an application by a large pastoralist taking up country in Western Australia, says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>He will probably require about 100 miles of netting in the first twelve months. His first order was for 40 miles, and we asked the New South Wales manufacturers to quote for this order, but they could not give delivery of the whole quantity in anything like the time required. We ordered a portion from them, but were obliged to order 25 miles from England. </para>
            <para>No financial advantage was gained from this step., as the English netting cost 5s. a mile more than the present price of Australian netting, and we think you will agree that it is inflicting undue hardship on the settlers of this State in  re-introducing  this Dumping Act clause when there is really no justification for it. </para>
            <para>As you are no doubt aware, the sale of sheep netting in the Old Country is so trifling to what it is compared with Australia, that to take the retail price of a single roll from a retail hardware store as a basis of comparison with an order for 100 miles is absurd. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The letter further points out that in the great area north of Kalgoorlie - Lawlers, Leonora, and Menzies - South Australian people are settling in large numbers. They look upon it as wonderful sheep country. The letter says that &#34; one of the most satisfactory features of the new development is that the country is being taken up by men of long pastoral experience in other portions of the State, and we venture to say that no better body of men could be found in Australia to open up this far-back country.&#34; The firm also says that a new province is being added to the State, and that it will carry an enormous number of sheep. These are matters of very grave importance. When we consider, first, that when this wire was required the Australian manufacturer was not able to supply the whole of it, and, secondly, that the price was higher in England than in Australia, we must admit that the imposition of a dumping duty was without justification. I believe netting is cheaper now. There has been a big reduction in the price of wire. At the time of the Ruhr trouble the cost of wire jumped in England owing to industrial troubles increasing the cost of coal, and the price of wire in Australia rose with the English price, although we were paying a subsidy for the manufacture of it. The Tariff Board might have informed Parliament of these facts. Apart from that aspect of the matter, I believe that the cost of wire has been decreasing, and the circumstances now may bc different from what they were when the gentleman to whom I have referred wrote his letter. The suggestion  that there is a wholesale trade in wire netting in Great Britain is, to my mind, absolutely preposterous. We cannot regard the matter in that light. </para>

              <para>- I have not  gone  into those figures. I believe that certain representations have been made, that I cannot discuss, but in view of the doubt that exists in regard to the quantity of wire netting used in the Old Country, I urge the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> to defer the taking of any action, and to have fuller investigations made. I would be satisfied with that for the time being. We desire to have the matter placed on a settled basis, because those who import netting want to be able to quote prices some little time in advance, and it is unfair to place them in the position of not being able to ascertain the prices at which they can supply the article. It is unfair also to the purchaser I sent a long telegram to the Premier of Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier)</inline> asking if he would cable to his Agent-General in England to find out the value of the Home consumption. I stated to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> that it had been represented that that consumption was very large, but that I regarded it as negligible. I also sought the assistance of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann).</inline> That information is not yet available, but I hope to have it in my possession later. </para>

The Government should realize the difficulties attendant upon the settlement of new country, and the vicissitudes with which every settler has to contend, such as fire, flood, drought, and exorbitant freight by sea and rail.

              <para>- The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> knows perfectly well that I am quite justified in my statements. While as a Protectionist he desires to see big protection given to secondary industries, at the same time his common sense tells him that the wealth created in the back country makes possible the good conditions enjoyed by the people in the cities. Not one secondary industry would exist for a day were it not for the market provided by the primary producers of the country. Therefore, why do honorable members talk such arrant nonsense? I hope that the Government will earnestly consider the difficulties and privations with which the men in the back country are faced. This wire netting is required, not for those resident in and around Sydney and Melbourne, but for those who have their farms and pastoral areas 200 and 300 miles from the centres of population. </para>

I hope that the Government will defer the action they propose-, and will endeavour to give relief to the struggling settlers. </para>

I shall have a good deal more to say to the Government later regarding the administration of the antidumping legislation. In thisparticular case, I regret exceedingly that the Government have in so inconsistent a manner sought to benefit one industry - practically a new industry in Australia - to the serious injury of one of our oldest and best industries. In South Australia the State Government has advanced no less a sum than &#163;3,000,000 on long terms to enable settlers to secure dog and rabbitproof fences, and thus enclose enormous areas of outside country. This work has been going on for 25 years. The wool from the big stations in South Australia provides an immense amount of wealth. Had it not been for the wool production of Australia, I do not know how we would have fared during the last year or two. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about sheep country. The breeding of sheep is an enterprise which, if properly encouraged, will bring into use the greater part of what the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> calls Kidman&#39;s country. That will greatly benefit Australia, and will prove advantageous to the shearers and working men who are supposed to be represented by honorable members opposite. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Kidman</inline>has nothing to do with the question before the Chair. Although South Australia has immense areas in full production, there are large tracts of country which have to be exploited by a further enormous expenditure of public money. The Darling country of New South Wales is to-day overrun with rabbits and dingoes, sheep having been driven out entirely. There are enormous areas in New South Wales, and a considerable range of country in. Queensland and in Western Australia, in a, similar plight. Is there any consistency in endeavouring to prop up unduly one industry in Australia, and by that action wiping out permanently a bigger and infinitely more important industry ? The value of the wool clip of Australia should not be overlooked when considering the action of the Government. I do not believe that the Government will do what is proposed, but I ask it to remember that the biggest of all our industries is the wool industry. It cannot be preserved if shackles are to be put upon it in the way indicated by the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs. I join with the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Gregory)</inline> in the view he takes of the matter. I cannot help referring to the fact that there must have been some recognition of the great need for wire netting when last session the Government brought down a measure to provide for the loan, free of interest, of &#163;250,000 to the States to provide wire netting. In view of that fact, it is strange that we should have this kind of treatment of primary producers outback. I ask the Government, in the interests of the primary producers of the country, and in its own interest, not to proceed with this inconsistent action of applying a dumping duty to imports of wire netting. The honorable member for Swan has clearly explained that we in Australia have for a long time been amongst the very best customers of those engaged in the. manufacture of wire netting in the Old Country. </para>

            <para>.-It was only upon my arrival from Sydney this afternoon that I learned that it was intended to. move the adjournment of the House to call attention to the imposition of an anti-dumping duty on wire netting. I saw from the newspapers that it had been imposed. I am one of those who have never approved&#39; of bonuses for the assistance of any industry. I was against the removal of the duty originally passed by the House in this case, and the substitution of the bonus system. With regard to the man on the land, one would think from the utterances of the two honorable members who have spoken from the other side that members on this side of the House are utterly regardless of the interests of the man on the land. I think it will be found that the history of politics in this Parliament, and in the New South Wales Parliament, of which I had the honour to be a member before I came here, shows that the true friends of the farmers have always been the Labour politicians. Perhaps in support of this statement I need do no more than mention the fact that recently in Western Australia and in South Australia, representatives of the parties&#39; opposite nave been practically obliterated by the farmers whom honorable members opposite claim to represent. We, on this side, have always believed in helping the farmers, but at the same time we wish the farmers to realize that there are some other people in this country, and that if its future is to be what we desire, secondary industries must be given a fair show, and. reasonable opportunities must he afforded to build up and maintain them. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> has stated that this Parliament gave &#163;250,000, free of interest, to the States in order that they might provide wire netting for the farmers. No member of this House objected to that. I might further say that the first proposal of the kind was made from this side of the House. There is evidence of a general desire to help the farmer. I wish first of all to deal with the letter to which the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> referred, pointing out that the wire netting industry in Australia could not supply orders. The honorable gentleman did not give the date of his letter. </para>

              <para>- After the war, when as every one knows, trade was disturbed for a considerable time, the big steel works of Australia closed down for something like twelve months. At that time 7,000 or 8,000 men were thrown out of employment, but we heard no special pleading on their behalf from members of the Farmers party. I believe that the honorable member will find that it was at that particular time that farmers&#39; orders for wire netting could not he supplied. The position to-day in Newcastle, Sydney, and Melbourne, where wire netting is produced, is that the manufacturers can supply more than Australia&#39;s require- . incuts. </para>

              <para>- I have not the exact figures by me, but the Minister for Trade and Customs informs me that 70 per cent, of the output of the industry in Britain is consumed in that country. There is a more important matter to be considered. I have referred to it before, and it will shortly have to be considered again in this House, and that is the preference which we give to Britain in respect of articles only 25 per cent, of the manufacture of which is carried out in that country. This preference is operating in such a way at the present time that British steel producers are not reaping any benefit from it at all. If we are in favour of a truly British preference, we should say so. At the present time many of the rollers of iron and steel, and drawers of wire are obtaining, through Belgium, no doubt, German wire rods, as they obtained German steel through Belgium in the same way some time ago. I remind honorable members opposite of this fact, because they were going to stop trading with Germany for a period of ten years. </para>

              <para>- That is what we are importing to-day. It is not the genuine producers of steel and iron in Britain who are benefiting by our preference today, but the drawers of wire who import their wire rods from the Continent. Because the British manufacturers are exporting a large proportion of their output to Australia honorable members opposite claim that they are not dumping, but let us consider the prices of netting in Great Britain and in Australia. For a mile of wire netting the price in England is .47 10s., and in Australia &#163;30 17s. 6d. They are selling their manufacture here, for about &#163;17 less per mile than they charge in  their  local market. </para>

Whilst Labour members are at all times prepared to do justice to the farmer, we want them to realize that their very best market is going to be their home market for most things they produce. If we are to have in Australia the population at which the immigration schemes of the Government aim, we must keep our secondary industries going, or there will not be work for the immigrants. I stand to-day where I have always stood in connexion with these matters, and shall do all in my power to enable Australia to produce and manufacture all articles which she is capable of producing or manufacturing. </para>

            <para>. - This question is of vital importance to Australia. I regret very much the action of the Government in imposing a dumping duty on wire netting. No man in this House realizes more than the Minister the absolute necessity for a plentiful supply of cheap wire netting being available to combat the rabbit pest. The Act quoted by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is perfectly justifiable, but in matters of this kind an exception should be made. If it is not possible under the Act to make exceptions, the Act should he altered to give the Minister that power. The honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> have instanced what has been done in large areas. But it is not only the holders of large tracts of land who require wire netting; it is quite as essential to many of the smaller landholders. I can speak from experience, and I say unhesitatingly that the figures quoted by the honorable member for </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> were absolutely misleading. I do not know the present price of wire netting, but the Australian-made article has always been dearer than the imported material. There is no question, however, that the wire netting manufactured in Australia is of better quality than the imported article, and for that reason I have always been prepared to pay a little more to obtain it. Owing to the necessity for conserving space in the ships, imported wire netting is rolled very much more tightly than that made in Australia, and, consequently, it does not give such good results. If it is necessary to protect this Australian industry, protection should be given by increasing the bounty already existing, rather than by the imposition of a dumping duty. The western division of New South Wales is to-day carrying about 16,000,000 sheep less than before the rabbits invaded that territory. Under existing conditions an additional 16,000,000 sheep would be earning for that State &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;12,000,000 a year. At the present time New South Wales is only carrying 50 per cent. of the stock she could carry if we had no rabbits. Without the rabbits the value of our wool and the amount of wages paid would be doubled, whilst the carrying capacity of the country would be increased very considerably. In one part of my electorate, owing largely to the influence of one man, the small landholders have gone in for wire netting and theeradication of the rabbits to a much greater extent than formerly, but if the price of netting is raised it will act detrimentally to their interests. The honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> spoke as if the shortage of netting existed only during the war period, but a little more than a year ago I ordered a supply for my holding which was not delivered for months. By the time I obtained it, damage in excess of the total cost of the netting had been done to a crop of wheat. If the Minister finds that under the existing Act he is compelled to impose this dumping duty on wire netting, he should give Parliament an opportunity to amend the Act as early as possible. </para>

              <para>- I do pot know, but it is nothing like 25,000 tons. When I was in Newcastle recently I saw thousands of miles of wire netting for which there was no market. The price to-day for Australian wire netting of the gauge most used is &#163;43 17s. 6d. per mile, and the English invoice price, c.i.f. and e., Melbourne, for the same material is &#163;41 19s. 6d. per mile. But the price at which that netting is sole&#39; in England is &#163;19 5s. 7d. per mile. The dumping duty  is  the difference between those two amounts. That shows that there is some reason why one-third of the netting manufactured .&#39;n England is invoiced out here at such a greatly reduced price. The wages in England are &#163;1 15s. lOd. for 47 hours, while in Australia &#163;4 7s. 6d. is paid for 48 hours. </para>

              <para>- I know as much about that as does the honorable member, but their position is not affected at all. It is not a question of the price, but of the brand of the netting. We are giving the bounty in order that employment may be found for our own people. Honorable members are aware that if 25 per cent, of British labour is employed in the manufacture of imported goods, such goods are classed as British. I am advised that most of the materia! for  the  imported wire netting does nob come from Great Britain. Such a state of affairs is not satisfactory; but the action of the Government has placed the farmer at no disadvantage, as his wire netting is no dearer. </para>

              <para>- I admit that the district represented by the honorable member who moved the adjournment is at a disadvantage because of the difference between the freight from Great Britain and the freight from Newcastle. The policy of this Parliament is one nf Protection, in order that our own people may find employment. That is the reason for the dumping duties. Although the. Act uses the word &#34; may,&#34; a common-sense interpretation makes action by the Minister mandatory. </para>

              <para>- That is so. If an attempt were made to take advantage of any Act on the statute-book to make the price of wire netting greater than it should be, it would be reprehensible, and the Government would soon he brought to task for it. The disparity between British and Australian wages in the wire netting industry is striking, and illustrates the sort of competition against which the dumping duty was designed to protect us. We must consider, not only those men who are engaged in the manufacture of wire netting, but also the men who mine the limestone, coal, and iron. The decision to admit British wire netting free of duty was arrived at simply in order that we might give some advantage to the users of that commodity. It is a great pity that the wire netting has not been more freely utilized. </para>

              <para>- Parliament decided to admit wire netting from Great Britain free of duty, but, unfortunately, the provision regarding 25 per cent, of British manufacture often acts injuriously to Australian industry, because it enables the product of foreign labour to be admitted into this country upon conditions which Parliament intended to be enjoyed- by the manufacturers of Great Britain only. The Government&#39;s action has been determined, not by considerations of price, but by the principle at stake. Australia is a Protectionist country, and is paying high wages fixed in a scientific way. </para>

What is the reason for the importation of mamother things if it is not to cause competition, and thus depreciate the price of local articles?

              <para>- Yes. I recognise that the Government has a duty to prevent restraint of trade. If it were proved that the manufacturers of Australia were taking advantage of this  protection to increase unduly the price of their products, it would be the Government&#39;s duty to take action. The Government did not impose this dumping duty without a full appreciation of the facta. The policy of the country is Protection, one of our Statutes provides for the imposition of a clumping duty in certain circumstances, and when the Tariff Board created by Parliament reported that those circumstances existed, I, as Minister, had no option but to act upon the Board&#39;s recommendation. </para>

              <para>- I think the course I adopted was the only one that was open to me. There are still a few Free Traders in this Parliament, but whatever may be the fiscal opinions of honorable members, all will agree that, other things being fairly equal, it is desirable that we should give employment to our own people, and use the products of our own factories, especially when they are better than imported goods. If as a result of that policy trade were restrained, and the price of wire netting became -extortionate, the Government would have power to act, and I have not the slightest doubt it would do so. </para>

            <para>.- Many people are not aware that rabbit flesh is a good and healthy food, and that the fur, weight for weight, is frequently of the same value as that of wool. But people complain because the rabbits eat the grass that would otherwise be available for sheep. I noticed that, in Western Australia, rabbit flesh was sold at from 9d. to ls. 6d. per lb., which compares favorably with the price of meat, so that, from a producer&#39;s point of view, there is something to be said for the rabbit. It has been stated that the number of sheep in New South Wales has been considerably reduced by the depredations of rabbits. Is not the reduction due to multi-millionaires of the Kidman type endeavouring to get rid of Australian workmen, rather than give them fair conditions of living on the sheep stations? As a boy I picked up wool in a shearing shed, and I remember the dis*gusting conditions in which shearers had to live fifty-five  years  ago. The improvement which has taken place  is  something of which Australia should bc proud. Kidman&#39;s cattle, no  less  than the rabbits, are eating the grass that would support sheep. Kidman changed from sheep to cattle because he did not wish to give Australian workmen a fair chance. The Australian Labour party will stand or fall by the policy of the new Protection, which .gives fair play to the producer , the consumer, and the men and women who are engaged in manufacturing, and I believe  it  will be indorsed by the Australian people when they thoroughly understand  it.  What ground for complaint has Great Britain  in  regard to duty imposed on wire netting imported into Australia? The English product has  a  10 per cent, preference over that of other countries, but Britain  is  not just to her own workers. I speak with knowledge gained from five years&#39; residence  in  Londo&#39;n, with all its , misery and wretchedness. I hold  in  my hand one glove of a pair presented to me by my daughter. I refused the first pair that was offered to me because I found that although the name &#34; Fownes, London,&#34; was on the button, the glove itself  was  made in Czecho-Slovakia. That English firm of Fownes tried to injure its own English workers by pretending that the glove made in Czecho-Slovakia was made  in  England. The  Only  thing that was made in England was the button. I have been informed that the firm was heavily fined for its conduct. A fine  is  no good  in  a case like that. Gaol  is  the only preventative. The duty on English netting was 68s. a ton, and on foreign netting it was 105s. No  man in  this House would say, either  On  the platform or  in  private conversation, that he preferred to help the foreign rather than the Australian workmen. Our policy  is  to build up Australian industries. Australia,  is  now self-contained with respect to wire netting. Twenty-five thousand tons could be manufactured here, and the work would support three primary industries. Is not our iron ore industry a primary industry? And are not our coal and limestone mining industries primary industries? The infernal system which has operated  in  England for so long with such injustice to the English people has banished the splendid type of Englishman of years ago. It has resulted  in  the English people being herded together in cities, and in attempts to raise men and women  on bread, tea, and what they call butter. The British Parliament will have to adopt protective duties sooner or later. The present cost of wire netting to the farmer in Great Britain is &#163;49 5s. 7d. per mile. The price of Australian wire notting is &#163;43 7s. 6d. But the British manufacturers wish to prevent the manufacture of wire netting in Australia. Therefore, while they charge their own English farmers &#163;45 5s. 7d. per mile, they will send netting out to Australia at &#163;41 19s. 6d., which price includes commission, insurance, freight, and exchange. No industry in the world, let alone our Australian industry, can stand undermining of that kind. It is unfair competition. The object of the Australian Industries Preservation Act is to prevent Australian industries and workmen from being injured by  unfair competition. That is the object of all our protective duties. The wonderful commercial rise of Germany was brought about by the adoption of a protective policy by Bismarck. I am surprised that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> did not &#39;speak of the infamous way in which the Mitchell Government prevented the Western Australian farmers from getting cheap wire netting. The Federal Government made  a splendid offer to the farmers of Australia by which, through the State Governments, they could have obtained wire netting free of interest for ten or twenty years. The Mitchell Government in Western Australia prevented the farmers of that State from taking advantage of the offer. I accuse both the last Western Australian Government and the last South Australian Government of not helping their farmers by making this netting available. This is a matter on which we need some straight speaking. </para>

            <para>:- The intention of the last Parliament respecting wire netting was very clear. It decided that wire netting from within the British Empire should be admitted into Australia free, and that a 10 per cent, duty should be imposed on foreign netting. To make up for the removal of the then existing duty, the Australian manufacturer was to be given a bonus. The Australian  consumers  were quite clear on what was the intention of the Government. In July last this Government showed by a reply given to questions that its intention at that time was that British wire netting should be free.

            <para>This is a serious matter which concerns the Government of the State. It is pointed out that the Commonwealth Government has already taken action to reduce the duty on wire netting which is now admitted free of duty if of British manufacture, and 10 per cent, duty foreign manufacture. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That declaration showed that the Government was quite clear on the position. The people of Australia, as well as this Parliament, understood that British netting was to be admitted free, and I think that the Minister for Customs should have taken due cognisance of that fact. Reports from America and Great Britain show that a big fall has occurred in the price of plain wire, and that there has been a sympathetic fall in the price of wire netting. It appears to me that the manufacturers of wire netting in Australia desire to prevent the price from falling here. The manufacturers want to hold all the advantages of the position. In 1914 vermin -proof wire netting cost from &#163;24 to &#163;28 per mile. To-day the cost is over &#163;40 per mile. That increase is a decided obstacle to the progress of Australia. We are asking new settlers to come to this country. If we place them on a 640-acre block, they immediately have to face the expenditure of &#163;400 on wire netting to make the block verminproof. That is a huge handicap on a new settler. Unless such a block is verminproof fenced, it is useless. I ask the Minister for Customs which is the more important - the development of our great natural resources, or the development of an industry of far less value to the country ? &#39; The Minister has been too prone to listen to reports from Rylands Limited, of Australia, about Rylands Limited, of England. I feel that there is a Combine in this business working in Australia. The Minister should have taken pains to ascertain the sentiments of thousands of men who are struggling to fence their blocks; then he would have learned another side of the question. As a matter of fact, he has no definite information from England. </para>

            <para>. - Remarks have already been made about the limited quantity of wire netting used in Great Britain. The Minister stated that something like 70 per cent. of Britain&#39;s wire netting was used in that country. But although I have some knowledge of both England and Scotland, I never saw a wire netting fence until I came to Australia. If a man went into an English iron monger&#39;s shop and asked for 50 feet of wire netting, the proprietor would think that he was in a big way. If he asked for 100 yards, the shopkeeper would be astonished; and if he asked for a mile, the shopkeeper, unless he had a strong heart, would drop down dead. &#39; If 70 per cent. of the netting manufactured in the Old Country were used in that country, and 30 per cent. exported, it would be reasonable to suppose that manufacturers could dump that small quantity; but I am convinced that only a very small portion of the netting manufactured in Great Britain is used there. </para>

              <para>Since the commencement of the current financial year, a considerable reduction  in  staff throughout the Commonwealth has  been necessary  to accord with declining activities,  but  approximately 80 per cent. of the total reduction has been brought about by voluntary  resignations.  Where  it  has  been  necessary  to dispense with the  services of limbless or badly disabled employees, special consideration has been given to each individual case  by  reference  to a  Problems Committee,  which has been  operating for  a  considerable  time in  connexion with cases amongst ex-soldiers generally  which   had been found specially difficult  to  repatriate. </para>
            </item>

          <para class="block">In all cases in which the termination of an appointment is in view, the practice is to give ample notice, so that the officer concerned may have an opportunity of securing another position. The Department also co-operates in every possible way to secure a suitable position for him. Where salaries have been reduced, such action has been necessary because the duties of the position no longer warranted the payment of the higher salary. In regard to the term additional duties,&#34; the position is that, &#34;With declining activities, it naturally became necessary to consolidate the duties of various positions. It may be pointed out that, in a number of instances where resignations had taken place, and it was found necessary to fill the positions, promotion of officers remaining on the staff resulted. There has been no discrimination between lower-paid and higherpaid officers at any time. </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="2.">
              <para>No. Only four appointmentsfrom outside have been made throughout the whole Commonwealth during the current financial year, these being necessary to fill vacancies caused by voluntary resignations, and, in one case, as the result of the temporary transfer of a member of a branch office staff to another State to relieve an officer on sick leave. In nocase has an incrementbeen granted to a high-salaried officer during this financial year, cither prior or subsequent to the appointments in question. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="3.">
              <para>Reductions in salary are made where it is found that the duties definitely carry less responsibility, irrespective of the status and salary of the officers concerned. The Commission has already declared redundant a considerable number of the higher-paid positions, and also reduced the salaries attaching to others. The necessarily large proportion of lower-paid positions in any Department makesit inevitable that, when reductions in numbers or salaries become necessary, the greater number, though not the greater proportion, of officers affected, will be found amongst the lower-paid. </para>

              <para>- It is the intention of the Repatriation Commission to vacate the Convalescent &#34; Farm &#34; at Kalamunda during the coming financial year. The experience in all States is that the continuance of this class of institution is not necessary for the type of patient now available, and the &#34; farms &#34; are being discontinued. The purpose for which they were originally intended has disappeared, and those patients at present in Kalamunda are in course of being dealt with in other ways as part of a well-considered and comprehensive scheme. The vacating of the institution will not prejudice the case of any of them. </para>

            <para>.-. As the fruit has been delivered and the bounty on it has been paid, there is only one thing left for honorable members to do, and that is to support the Bill: In the first speech that I delivered in this House I tried to make my views clear regarding: the Government entering into competition with private enterprise. I am strongly opposed to the Government doing any such thing, and after hearing the debate: on this Bill, I am still more convinced of the soundness of my views. It is dangerous for any  Government to  pay bounties) because the benefit is not distributed equitably to those who should receive it. The fruit bountyis not paid to the fruit industry, as awhole, but to a limited number of growers. To pay a bounty to a section of growers is unfair to others who- do not share the advantage. Many fruit-growers have been worse off than those for whom we are asked toprovide assistance. The growers of apricots, peaches, pears, and pineapples will benefit to: the extent of  &#163;130,000.  Other fruitgrowers ought to share equally in any assistance the Government may give. That is why. I am opposed to the Government; entering into competition with private enterprise. This action of the Government&#39; seems to verge on class legislation of the worst type. There are many otherways in which, a Governmentmay* help the fruit-growers. The giving of;bounties only causes trouble&#39; with those who do not participate in them;  it is  one of the quickest means of landing a Government  in  trouble. What we want is less: Government  in  business and morebusiness  in  government . The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scul- lin)</inline> advocated, more co-operation, organization,, and. Government control. With his first two points I entirely agree; but I am totally opposed to Government con-  trol. I have never yet seen an instance of a Government having made a success of any business which it has taken over. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman.)</inline> has stated on the floor of this House on more than one occasion that the Government will assist cooperative companies.. I have in mind two co-operative companies which commenced operations in Southern Tasmania. The growersraised the money, erected: their factories, and were prepared to treat their own fruit - apricots. That was prior to the granting of this bounty. When the Government announced that it intended to give a bounty, those growers, considering that they had as much right to a share as had other apricot growers who were not in a co-operative company, approached the Government; but were turned down. Thatwas manifestly unfair. </para>

              <para>- Theywere dehydrating their own apricots for sale, and theGovernment refused to help them: in their enterprise, notwithstanding that assistance was being given to other growers. In his second-reading speech, the Minister stated that the Government had lost &#163;618,000 in Pools and bounties. I accept those figures- as being correct; but:I contend that the Minister did not put&#39; the case as- fairly as lie should: The fruit-grower supplied&#39; good fruit, the canner didhis workwell, but the Governmenfmade a shocking failure on the business side of the Pools. The outside public believed that the growers received the benefit, of the &#163;618,000. The truth is that that moneywas lost by the Government in the sale of the fruit. The first. Pool started in. the season. 1921-22.. In Tasmania, something like 2,000 tons of apricots, and plums, were pulped. . I- understand that much of that pulp is still stored in: thebonded stores in Hobart under Government, control. It hasbeen allowedto remainsolong that ithasbeen found; necessary to give away for pig food, or to destroy nearly at thousand tons. Is it anywonder, then, that the Government has last money? It cost &#163;20, a tonto pulp thatfruit, and practically thewholeof itwillbe lost. It will be a difficult matter to sell any of that fruit. We were told ,further, by like- Minister, that the: market was practicallyclear of all old, stacks of fruit. In 1921-22, 30,000 eases of apricots, pears, and plains.were canned. Of that quantity, 20,000 tins were destroyed. There are to-dayover 4,000 dozen tins of canned pears in Hobart. The Government could1 <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> said those time and again, but for some unexplained reason it is still hanging on to them, and before very long theywill have to be thrown out. Governments; as a rule, are not in a position to carry on a business as well as an ordinary business man. In l923, about 50,000 cases of apricots- and pears were canned in Hobart, and there are 20,000 dozen still unsold. Yet  Ave  arc&#169; told&#39; that the market is bare of the old fruit. Unless that fruit is. moved quickly, it will have <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> be thrown out, because the acid; eats&#39; the tin away, and the moment ahole appears in the tin the fruit becomes&#39; bad&#39;. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to the Pools, inwhich the Minister stated that the Government had lost &#163;618,000. I. remind; the Government, also, that there were 1,000,000 cases of canned fruits in. Australia in 1922. For that fruit the publicwere asked, originally, to pay from 14s.to 15s.  per  dozen. Then the Minister embarked on an &#34; Eat More Fruit&#34; campaign, and reduced the price to 101/2d.per tin retail. Thatwas a very good scheme, and it resulted in a large quantity of the fruit being sold&#39; in Australia. The bulk, however,was sent to England,where,we are told by the Minister-, it realized 7s. per dozen. The honorable gentleman did not inform tfee* House what were the expenses incurred in the consignment of that fruit to England: The freight, insurance, cartage, storage; and commission on sale, wouldnot amount tolessthan 3s 6d. per dozen. Therefore, instead of realizing 7s. per dozen, the net returnwould be only 3s. 6d. per dozen). The Government engaged the services of a meat salesman,abutter salesman, and an American firm to sell our Australian?  canned fruits in England. There were many Australians, as well as other fruit merchants, who would have handled that fruit to a great deal better advantage. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said that if grapes were sold in Melbourne at 3d., instead of 6d., per lb., a great many more would be bought. I do not think it requires much intelligence to realize that. One might say&#39; that if they were sold at 1 1/2d per lb., the quantity disposed of would be larger. But what would become of the producers of those grapes ? He is bound by law to pay certain costs for the production of grapes, and I claim that if the Government passes laws imposing fixed conditions of production upon a producer, it should also fix the retail selling price of the commodity he produces. If the Government is not able to fix the price of an article, it has no right to fix the costs of its production. This is another reason why I am against Government interference with private enterprise. It is all very well to ask the grower to sell his grapes at a low price, but it is not possible for him to do so if a high cost of production is fixed by law. </para>

              <para>- That is all very  well in theory, but it will not work out in practice. The law of the land prescribes that a man growing grapes, or other fruits, shall grow them under certain conditions, and if the cost of production is high, the grower cannot sell his fruit cheaply. I repeat that if the Government passes laws which make the cost of production high, they should fix the price of the commodity produced. We should pass no laws to hamper industry and the man on the land. I was struck by some of the remarks which were made by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> He said that the two industries, sugar and fruit-growing, worked together. I agree with that statement, but lev me try to show honorable members the difference between the growers of fruit and of sugar. The grower of sugar has the retail price of his commodity fixed for him. He knows exactly what he will get for his cane when he takes it to the mill. He knows what it will cost him to grow it, and what his profit will be. Now let us consider the position of the fruitgrower. He knows what it will cost him to grow his fruit, and he has <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pay for the materials he requires practically 100 per cent, more than he had to pay in prewar times. Does he know what he will get for his apples when he grows them? He does not, aud very often they have to be allowed to drop to the ground, and are an absolute loss. It is very unfair that in the case of two people producing commodities from the earth, one should have the price of his commodity fixed, and the other should. have no fixed price for his production. The honorable member for Capricornia told us that we are getting sugar in Australia to-day which, plus duty, is cheaper by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;12</inline> per ton than sugar grown outside Australia by black labour. I think that the Minister concurred in that statement. I ask whether we really are getting sugar at the world&#39;s parity. Why are those who support the sugar industry in Australia so pronounced about keeping the embargo on the importation of sugar if what the honorable member for Capricornia has stated is correct^ If sugar produced in Australia is cheaper than sugar produced outside of Australia, surely the embargo upon the im-  portation of sugar is of no use to Australian sugar producers. If any person can obtain sugar in Australia more cheaply than he can obtain it outside he will not go outside for it, and therefore the embargo is of no use. &#34;What I ask the Government to do is to remove the embargo on the importation of sugar. Although the honorable member for Capricornia submitted a lot of figures to show that the price of sugar outside is greater than the price inside Australia, his figures really proved nothing. If the Government will lift the embargo I will guarantee that in two months sugar will be sold in Australia for 31/2d. per lb. If the Government lifted the embargo I fancy the honorable member for Capricornia would squeal like a whipped pup. Money is the tiling that counts, and not figures. The honorable member went so far as to quote all the profits which Jones and Company have made in Tasmania out of jam, and he spoke of the company as a profiteering firm. The honorable member was very clever in refraining from saying anything about the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and its profits. I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Sugar Journal</inline> of the8th June, 1923, and the figures I am about to quote are figures relating to a period when sugar was under Government control. I find this statement appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal: -</inline></para>

            <para>The 137th report of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company covering the half year ended 31st March, shows that the profit made during that period on the work of the mills and refineries, after providing for depreciation and other charges, amounted to &#163;187,123, which, with the earnings from other investments subject to Federal income tax, gave a total of &#163;237,105. From this sum the Board proposed to place &#163;50,000 to reserve fund, and from the first amount to pay a dividend of 15s. per share, and from the second amount a dividend of 5s. per share, absorbing in all &#163;212,500. </para>

          <para class="block">When the honorable member talks about other people making big profits, here is a concern that made &#163;237,000 in six months, <inline font-style="italic">or twice</inline> as much as the honorable member accused Jones and Company of making in a year. I want to know now where are the profiteers. If there are any greater profiteers than those in the sugar industry I want to know where they are. I say without hesitation, andfrom knowledge I gained while in Queensland, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is the greatest scandal in Australia to-day. If Australia is to keep her place in the world by the success of both her primary and secondary industries, the course of the Government is clear. It should repeal a great many of the laws on the statute-book, which at present are hampering both primary and secondary industries. The Government should look into the matter, and see whether legislation may not be introduced to prevent the industries we have in Australia being penalized by such legislation as the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I have very much pleasure in supporting the Bill now under consideration </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member who has just sat down made a considerable mouthful of what was said by the Leader of the Opposition. If he had read the whole of the speech he would have found that it is questionable whether any speech delivered in this House was more favorable to the producers than that which the Leader of the Opposition delivered on this Bill. In the passage to which the honorable member referred, the Leader of the Opposition was following up statements he made indicating the great difference between the price paid by the consumer and the price paid to the producer of fruit. Every member of this House is aware that neither the producer nor the consumer in the fruit business gets a fair deal. There are intermediaries who mop up most of the profit, and it was to that which the Leader of the Opposition was referring when he said that the producer might secure a fair price for his fruit if there were not so many intermediaries between him and the consumer. The honorable gentleman argued that if the marketing of fruit was conducted in a more efficient manner, the consumer would obtain fruit at a cheaper rate, and the producer would secure a better price for his fruit than he gets at the present time. </para>

I am inhearty accord with the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney).</inline> Instead of trying to interfere with the tariffs of other countries, whether the Mother Country or not, we should arrange for the better conveyance of our &#39;products to other countries. I have received no communication from the British &#39;Government, but I believe that, apart from the tariff issue, they will do all they can to provide facilities for the t ransit tothe Mother Country of the products of Australia and the other Dominions by the granting of cheaper freight rates than at present exist. If our fruitgrowers could obtain areduction of &#163;3, &#163;4, or &#163;5 in the freight to England it would mean a great advantage to them, and it certainly would be a great benefit to the consumers on the otherside of the world.Sofar as this Bill is concerned, the money has been paid and the whole transaction practically closed. To that there is no objection, except that it is time we ended these stop-gap actions and had a continuous policy which would enable producers and consumers to know exactly where they stood. The honorable member for Franklin (Mr.Seabrook)spoke of Government interference, but God only knows what would have happened to the producers of Tasmania iftheGovernment had not stepped in on many occasions. In war time thehonorable member railed againstthevariouspools, but &#39;Government control wasthe only thing possible under the conditionswhich existed; and it was a veritable Godsend tothe primary producers. The honorable member&#39;s remarks do notexpress the sentiments ofthe primary producers whom he is here to represent.

I am glad that the electors of Australiaare realizing who are theirtrue friends.

The House will be wise to allow this Billto pass, although, in respect tosome of its details, theremay be differences ofopinion. I shall support it generally, but reser veto myself the right to suggest alterations in regard to details.

As the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> referred to the various Pools and bounty schemes, I feltsurethathe had good ground for his statement thatthere is need of &#34;more business in Government.&#34; While he was speaking I could not help asking myself what the position of thefruit-growers of Australia would have been if they had been lef tentirely to the tender mercies of private enterprise. Even the person who thinks that Government control in business is unwise must admit thatthe actiontakenby the Government was in the best interests of &#39;the primary producers. There is no need to talk at length on this Bill, the canning season having finished. I hope, however, that the Government is  not considering the interests of the peach, apricot, and apple-growers only, but those of the grapegrowers also. </para>

The Minister thinks I should not be interested in grapes because I do not drink wine, but I represent the greatest grape-growing district in South Australia. The electors there had sense enough to place me here as their representative, and also to elect two Labour men to represent them in the State Parliament, turning out two Liberals to that end.

              <para>- I am almost ashamed to be a citizen of this country. Land can be obtained in Australia as cheaply as anywhere in the world, the country is blessed with climatic conditions which enable almost anything to be grown, yet the producers are crying out for cheaper transit, both on land and water, and for bounties on everything they produce. Theyshould be ashamed to ask for bounties or for preference. Australia should be able tocompete with older countries, whose producers are handicapped by difficulties greater than ours. &#39;The granting of preference will mean an increase in the cost of living in the Old Country.

          <para class="block">Seabrook) desires to repeal the Navigation Act, because he wants cheap freight for the apples from Tasmania. He does not consider the conditions of the men working on the ships carrying those apples. I would strenuously oppose any attempt to scrap the Navigation Act. which is in the best interests of humanity. This measure is another dole to Tasmania. One of the greatest monopolies in the Commonwealth is that of Henry Jones and Co., and that firm, which already gets cheap sugar, is now to be given a bounty for sending fruits and jams overseas. The more fruit we send abroad the higher will be the price charged to the local consumer. I am opposed to the proposed bounty, because I believe that the fruit-growers of Australia can successfully compete in markets abroad, and they can also do much more to encourage local consumption. At the present time they make no attempt to place their products before the local consumer. By granting bounties on this and bounties on that, the Government is engaged in a policy of feeding sops to the Country party, and I am convinced that that party, wheal it has squeezed the Nationalists dry, will kick them out of office. </para>

            <para>.- This clause provides for the appropriation of money for the payment of a bounty on the production of. canned fruits inaccordance with schedule1, and on the export of canned fruits according to schedule 2. A reference to the schedule shows that in respect of canned apricots the grower will receive about 1.2d. per lib., and in respect of clingstone peaches less than1d. per lb. I draw the attention of the Committee to the inconvenient way in which the schedules are drafted, the first two fixing the bounty at so much per dozen tins, and the third schedule the price to be paid per ton of fruit. One has to work out an arithmetical sum before he can arrive at the effect of the rates. Having done that, he finds that the grower will receive less under this Bill than will the exporter. It seems ridiculous that  a man who is purchasing fruit for export shall be paid by the Government more than he will pay to the grower. In effect, the canner will obtain his fruit for nothing, and will get in addition a fraction of a penny per lb. for the fruit that he cans. That provision does not appeal to me. </para>

              <para>- The second reading of the Bill was agreed to without a division because we desire to help the fruit-growers, bub not at unnecessary expense to the taxpayers. Whilst we are desirous of encouraging primary production, we should make sure that the bounty we give reaches the man for whom it is intended, namely, the grower. I cannot believe that a man can profitably grow fruit at less than1d. per lb: If he cannot do so, why does the Bill propose to give the canner . 3d. per lb. more than the canner will pay to the grower? </para>

              <para>- That statement may be correct, but to the layman it sounds ridiculous. I do not think anybody will agree that it is more costly to can fruit than to grow it. I desire to help the fruit-growers and primary producers generally, but I do not intend to hand out the public money to people who are nob entitled to it. This Bill will cost the taxpayers from &#163;130,000 to &#163;140,000 per annum, and if an undue proportion of that amount will go into the pockets of the canners without assisting the growers, we are proceeding on wrong lines. We have not yet been informed of the reason for the difference in the payments to the canners and growers respectively. </para>

            <para>.- I did not intend to speak again on this measure because I thought all that it was necessary to say had been said ; but, as the representative of a great sugar-producing district in Queensland, I feel that it is necessary for me to reply to some remarks that have been made by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook),</inline> who is a Nationalist. We representatives of sugar-producing districts in Queensland are not opposed to assisting the Australian fruit industry. A while ago a Country party member spoke about &#34;the sugar industry. He know nothing about it. Then the misrepresentation was by a member of the Country party, and to-day it is by a Nationalist member. Both sections of this composite Government, therefore, have vilified and misrepresented the sugar producers of Queensland. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> wants the sugar embargo lifted, so that sugar produced in Java by black labour may be imported into this country. He knows nothing about the position, or he would not have spoken as he did. The sugar-producers are willing to help the fruit-growers, but they object to assistance intended for the growers going to the canners, who are fleecing the fruitgrowers of Australia. The honorable member for Franklin says&#39; that if the sugar embargo were lifted everything would be all right. As a matter of fact, the jam makers of Australia are getting their sugar for the manufacture of jams for export at world&#39;s parity when it favours them. World&#39;s parity is &#163;30 18s.7d. per ton, and the Queensland price is &#163;27 per ton. </para>

              <para>- Nonsense ! The honorable member does not know what he is talking about. Australian sugar is &#163;12 10s. per ton cheaper than Java sugar, plus duty. If Java sugar, which costs &#163;30 18s. 7d. per ton f.o.b., were admitted free, and the freight, refining charges, and other costs were added, the price of the sugar would&#39; be &#163;35 per ton. The Australian cost is &#163;35 13s. The jam manufacturer, however, is given a rebate of 13s. per ton, so that he may have his sugar at world&#39;s parity. That being the case, he has no cause for complaint. If the honorable member for Franklin does not know that, he does not know anything about the position. He desires to get black-labour sugar from Java without giving any consideration whatever to the 100,000 people who are depending on the sugar industry in Queensland. If those people were given no consideration whatever, and the Java sugar were admitted as he wishes, the jam manufacturers would be no better off. For the last ten years the average retail price of sugar in Australia has been 4Ad. per lb. In that time it has been as high as ls. and ls. 2d. per lb. in Loudon, 9d. per lb. in France, and 8d. &#39; per lb. in South Africa. Even to-day Australian consumers are getting their sugar at 4Ad. per lb., while the people in England are paying 7d., the people of South Africa 5{rd., and the people of New Zealand 5d. per lb. I challenge the honorable member for Franklin to refute these facts. Under our present arrangement we are building up a great Australian industry, and yet giving the jam manufacturer his sugar at world&#39;s parity. Is the honorable member for Franklin a patriotic Australian ? Does he wish to build up an Australian industry which is supporting 100,000 people and helping secondary industries? It appears that he favours a black-labour policy,  and that there are black labour advocates amongst the Nationalists in this Parliament as well as in the State Parliaments. We should not be setting one section of primary producers at the throat of another section, but we should be turning our attention to the wealthy jam manufacturers and canners who provide funds for this composite Government and for Nationalist members opposite. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> has never put up a fight for the sugar growers, and now that I am trying to refute statements which have been made in this House, he does not want the facts stated. I point out to the honorable member for Franklin that the wholesale price per dozen of 30-oz. tins of peaches is Ss., and the retail price is 12s. The value of the sugar content of a dozen tins of those peaches is only 9d., orJd. per tin. If the sugar &#39;were obtained for nothing it would make very little difference in the price of the peaches. The price of sugar i3 not responsible in any way for the slump in the fruit industry. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Franklin wishes to admit black labour sugar, without giving any consideration to the Queensland sugar workers and farmers. That is the kind of thing we get from dig composite Government. If honorable members opposite do not support the sentiments of the honorable member for &#39;Franklin, let them stand up and say so. The canners are the people to whom we should be turning our attention and criticising on their exploitation of the fruit-growers and consumers. Immediately a subsidy was granted, the wholesale price of canned clingstone peaches was increased by ls., and in some cases by ls. 6d. on a dozen tins. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> knows that profiteering is being carried on by these canners. Some honorable members on the other side want to wipe out the Queensland sugar industry, remove the embargo, and abolish the Arbitration Courts. I fell them that the fruit-growers would be no better off - in fact worse off - if that were done than they are today. &#39; The fruit-growers have been, and are being fleeced by jam manufacturing and canning companies, like Henry Jones and Company Limited. That company has made a profit of &#163;500,000 in the last five years. I advise the fruitgrowers of Australia to devote some attention to the Tory politicians who are trying to exploit them. They should work out their own destiny, evolve a fruit marketing scheme for the whole of Australia, and control the marketing. of their own products. Marketing should not  be  in thehands  of  the middlemen, exploiters; market riggers, and canners, who are  entrenched  behind honorable members  opposite.I  welcome lite measure before  us,  because it will tide the fruitgrowersover a  very  trying period, but I refuse to listen quietly to honorable members condemning, maligning and misrepresenting the sugar producers, as has been done to-day. Both sections  of  this composite Government have joined in the attack  on  the sugar industry. The honorable member for Franklin. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> cannot refute the facts I have put bef ore the Committee. He has made  a  lot  of  general statements which really mean nothing. He should not  be  setting one section  of  the primary producers  at  the throat  of  another section.. &#34;We should  be  much more tolerant and considerate towards one another, and should bend our best energies to help Australia to develop both her primary and secondary industries,  so  that  we  may become a much greater country than  we  are, with the best  of  all markets  - a  home market - for our producers. </para>

            <para>. - The Leader  of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> will remember,  because he  took a very active part in this matter; that the canners and growers were consulted regarding the price to  be  paid for fruit. He will also remember that the growers at Leeton, when the whole&#39; matter  Was  settled, held a public meeting  at  which were passed resolutions expressing satisfaction  at  the price fixed. Those resolutions were afterwards conveyed  to  the Government, whichwas thanked for the action that had been taken. No one knows better than the honorable member that  we  had,  to  bring the canners in  because  just  then we  were in a very difficult  position.  This arrangement was the result  of  a joint agreement between the canners, the growers, and the Government, and it has worked  very  satisfactorily. Matters look more promising  for  the future, as  we  have practically been  enabled to  provide a market for our  fruit. </para>

            <para>.- I  am&#34;  disappointed with the explanation that  the  Minister has  just  given;  he has not  compliedwith the request which I made. It may be that the growers are perfectly satisfied with the amount they are to receive under  this  Bill; but the question. I asked was-, whether there was any justification for the granting of a bounty to the canners greater than the amount that they paid for the fruit. In the case of peaches, the canners are to receive 3 of a penny  mouse  from the Government than they pay to the grower. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing with export. Under the first schedule a bounty of1s is paid on. every dozen tins of canned peaches. If the. fruit is exported, we pay an. additional amount, asset out in the second: schedule, which is 1s. 9d. If the fruit is exported the canner gets l-.3d. on account of fruit  for  which ho pays the grower a fraction under1d. per  lb.  Accepting, the stater ment that the growers are satisfied with 1d. per lb. for their fruit, what we want to&#39; know is- whether public money should be given to the canners to an amount greater than that which they pay the man who produces the fruit? The Minister has not endeavoured to answer that point; he has contented himself with saying that the canners and growers have come  to  an agreement, and that the growers are satisfied. I quite realize that if the growers are guaranteed a certain price, which they regard as satisfactory, they  will  be prepared  to  accept it. Thisscheme will cost the taxpayers of Australia from &#163;130,000 to &#163;140,000 per annum-. Should we give such an amount for the purpose of insuring the canning and disposing of the fruit ? The honorable member for Echuca (Me. Hill), by interjection, has stated that the canner pays more for the  tin.  than ho&#39; gets&#39;.from the Government. He may, or he may not, but even  if  he does, he sells the fruit- in the tin and it is  a  question whether the consumer does not pay for  the tin. </para>

              <para>- ,J should say it is less than a living wage. But even though ho is satisfied, are we justified in giving to the canner .3d. more than he gives the man who grows the fruit ? In Committee the opportunity presents itself to make any amendments deemed necessary. I do not desire to amend the measure if it is satisfactory, but I want to have roy mind made easy on this point. If any honorable member can clearly show that this does not mean the making of an undue payment to those who are canning the fruit I shall be perfectly satisfied. In these days, when we are giving away so much of the public money in the shape of bounties and in other directions, we should at least be careful to see that it is not being wasted. If the canners are getting &#163;30,000 to &#163;40,000 more than they arc entitled to receive we ought to amend the schedule. In common with every other honorable member, I want to assist the man who is producing the fruit, and to see that he gets a fair deal ; but in doing that I do- not want to give to other persons a greater amount than they are entitled to get. The meagre information that has been placed before us does not justify us in passing the clause. If the Minister will give us that information I shall support him. It is all very well to talk about the expense incurred by the canner in providing the tin. What about the expenses of the man in the orchard ? He has to purchase his plant, employ labour at current rates of wages, put up with all the risk of frost, drought, and other hardships. Year after year we have passed Bills for the making of certain grants, in some cases without having proper information to guide us. Subsequently some of us have regretted the vote which we have given. I do not want to be placed in that position in this case. Every one is desirous of assisting those who are growing fruit. The industry is necessary in the interests of our country. At the same time we want to protect the taxpayer and to see that he is not unduly burdened because some people are given more than they are entitled to receive. I am more inclined to give the grower a greater amount than the canner. The honorable member for Echuca states that Id. per lb. is a bare living wage, and I quite believe him. I doubt very much whether it will provide a bare living ; that will depend upon whether the grower it? fortunate in having good seasons and good crops. </para>

            <para>. - Because of the intimate connexion I had with the matter, I am glad to take advantage of this opportunity to say something regarding the charges made in connexion with the processing of fruit and their relation to the payments made to various sections of the fruit industry. Before doing so, I should like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (Mi1. Charlton) upon his expression of opinions in connexion with this matter, because- it may be aptly recalled when the Prime Minister comes down with proposals to assist the primary and secondary industries in the way he has suggested. I am glad to know beforehand that the Leader of the Opposition is going to support those proposals. It has been suggested that the payments made to the canners are greater than those made to the fruit-growers. That is not so, except in regard to certain kinds of fruit canned for export. I take, first of all, the &#39;figures relating to apricots. Under the arrangement, the price to be paid by the canner for fresh fruit at the orchard is &#163;10 per ton. The average number of dozen &#39;30-oz. tins of canned fruit obtained from each ton of fresh fruit is 106. The cost of fresh fruit in  each  dozen 30-oz. tins of  canned  fruit is therefore ls. 10&#163;d. The cost of canning, which, of course, <inline font-style="italic">*h.q</inline> canner has to bear, is 5s., which is less by 3d. than the amount which was given under the Fruit Pool last year. The year before that, and before the processers were approached at all, they said it was necessary that they should have&#39; &#39;7s. 6d. to cover their expenses. Honorable members will see that in this case the cost of processing has been cut down to bedrock. It is interesting in this connexion .to detail what actually took place at the conference at which this matter was settled. </para>

              <para>- No, it is my statement. The negotiations took place in public. They were carried on between representatives of the growers, of the processers, and of the Government. The growers were insistent - and the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> who introduced deputation after deputation, will confirm my statement - ihat some arrangement should be come to, because they knew that unless the processing of fruit took place they would be in a hopeless position. At the Conference there were representatives of the co-operative canning concerns, and also of proprietary canning concerns. There was there as well the Victorian Commissioner of Irrigation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Cattanach.  The whole matter was discussed at very great length. We informed the Conference that the proposal submitted was the outside proposal to which the Government could consent. The proprietary canners said that they would not accept the proposal because they could not possibly work under it. The only canners&#39; representatives to remain to discuss the proposal were the co-operative canners, who in all cases have the State Governments behind them. They said that the only reason they could look at the Government&#39;s proposal was because they would be dealing, not with their own money, but with public money. The Henry Jones and other proprietary companies absolutely refused to have anything to do with the proposition, because they said that they could not possibly pay wages under it. They stood out altogether. It was not until the fruit was actually coming in, and they found that the co-operative canners and certain small proprietary canners had decided to go on with the proposal, that the big proprietary canners ultimately decided to accept the Government proposition, which, as I have said, represented from the point of view of the canners 3d. per dozen less than they received last year, and 2s. 6d. less than they received two years ago. On apricots for home consumption I have said the cost of canning would be 5s.; the cost of casing and labelling, lOd. ; cost of freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. That is to say that apricots cost the canners &#163;6 per ton at the orchard for home consumption. In the case of export, I point out that the essential part of the Government&#39;s scheme was that the canners should not be permitted to pick and choose the fruit they would can. They had to take all the fruit offered at their factories that was in a good condition. They were responsible not merely for the canning, but for the sale of the fruit overseas. In the case of apricots, the cost per dozen f.o.b. at Australian ports would be 8s. 2d. ; the total cost, duty paid, ex store, in England, 7s. 6&#163;d. This allowed for the bounty per dozen of 2s. 5d., and the rebate for sugar contents&#39; which the Imperial preference permitted. In the case of apricots the bounty will represent to the canner free fruit, plus 6M. per dozen 30-oz. tins. We found that because of the intensive advertising campaign of the Government during the last few months it was not necessary, as we thought it would be, to export 30 per cent, of the fruit. Eighty per cent, was consumed in Australia, and only 20 per cent, was sent overseas. So that for four-fifths of the fruit the canner has had to pay for apricots &#163;6 per ton, which, as I have shown, is the price which the fruit cost the canner for home consumption. Under the arrangement, the price to be paid by the canner for pears was &#163;10 per ton, which is &#163;3 per ton more than was paid to the growers of pears under the first Pool of 1920. At that time the growers were paid only &#163;7 per ton. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that the price paid for the fruit is not a high price, taking into consideration existing conditions in the fruit-growing industry. The price has to cover the cost of cases, tins, freight, cartage, manure, and sprays, and it does not represent more than a mere living. It covers practically the bedrock cost of fruit growing. I have said that the price to be paid for pears was &#163;10 per ton at the orchard. The average number of dozen 30-oz. tins of canned pears obtained from each ton of fresh fruit is 70. The cost of fresh fruit in each dozen 30-oz. tins is 2s. lOd. ; cost of canning, 5s. 3d.; casing and labelling, lOd. ; and freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. The total cost per dozen 30-oz. tins, after deducting the bounty, is Ss. 5d. In this case the bounty will represent -per ton of fresh fruit, &#163;2 15s. ; and the fruit will cost the canner at the orchard &#163;7 7s. per ton. When we consider the position with respect to the export of canned pears we find that the cost per dozen f.o.b. at Australian ports is 9s. 6d. ; the bounty per dozen, 2s. 3d. ;. sugar rebate, 3d.; and the bounty will represent to the canners fruit at &#163;2 ls. per ton. Pineapples for export will represent to the canner &#163;2 5s. Cd. per ton. and for consumption in Australia &#163;4 15s. Id. per ton. In the case of cling peaches the price to be paid by the canner for fresh fruit at the orchard is &#163;9 pelton. The average number of dozen 30-oz. tins of canned fruit obtained from each ton of fresh fruit is 100. The cost of fresh fruit in. each dozen. 30-oz. tins of canned fruit is ls. 9&#163;d. ; cost of canning, 4s. 9d. ; cost of casing and labelling, lOd. ; freight and cartage from orchard to cannery, 3d. Total cost per dozen 30-oz. tins, after deducting bounty, 6s. 7id. ; cost of fruit at the  orchard to the canner, &#163;4 per ton. That is for home consumption. In the case oi cling peaches for export, the cost per dozen f.o.b. Australian ports is 7s. lOd. : bounty, per dozen, 2s. 9d. ; sugar rebate, 3d. ; total cost, duty paid, ex store in England, 6s. 10&#163;d. So that the bounty will represent to the canner free fruit plus ll&#163;d. per dozen 30-oz. tins. What made the real problem of the fruit industry in Australia was the over-production of peaches. Honorable members have to remember that in these cases the canner has to take the risk of the loss of 5s. 7d. of his own money to cover wages and material, as well as what he has to pay for sending the goods overseas. </para>

              <para>- From the terms in which the Leader of the Opposition spoke one would think that the processers are being paid more for their fruit than the grower. I am pointing out that in the case of export the  processer  has to run the risk first of all of having to pay 5s. 7d. of his own money, as well as the bounty he receives, on what he exports. The agreement that we insisted should be drawn up provided that the  processer  had to take all the fruit offering. We said to the  processer,  &#34;You may not choose merely what you think can be disposed of. You must take all the fruit available that passes the Customs test regarding quality, and is offered in good condition.&#34;That is the reason for the exceptionally liberal terms iri respect to exports. Had the surplus not been exported, prices would have been forced down in Australia, and no more could have been sold, as the prices were already reasonable. I hope the Committee will accept the clause and the schedule. The arrangement is much worse from the canners&#39; point of view - and therefore more beneficial from the point of view of the public - than at any time during the four years in which the Federal Government has had anything to do with the fruit business. When honorable members recollect that in the second year of the Fruit Pool, when there was a loss of &#163;300,000, the total amount received by the growers was &#163;120,000, and that the Government, which was paying for the processing and marketing of the fruit, lost &#163;180,000, they will understand that the canners are taking a considerable risk, and no one will begrudge them their success if, by satisfactory marketing arrangements and the excellence of their products, they have been able to make a profit. The cooperative companies, especially the factories at Shepparton and Kyabram, which have been doing good work for several years, will be enormously heartened if they can make more than &#39;a bare existence. It is to be hoped that they will be able&#39; to extend their operations, and thus be in a position to absorb the surplus of fruit which will increase from year to year. </para>

              <para>- That relieved the market. The consumers of Australia came to the rescue of the man on the land&#39;. Australia is the best market for Australian fruit, and the best buyers of the products of the primary producers are the families of the working men in the cities of Australia. Yet these are&#39; the people whom the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> and others -would throw out of employment to-morrow. The canning companies fought for better conditions. They asked for more than they expected to receive, and said in effect, &#34;We want half-a. loaf. but we ask for a whole loaf.&#34; They are the people who have benefited from the granting, of- this canning bonus. We on this side of the House object to the unhappy tendency of the Government to &#34; greasethe fab pig.&#34; We object to firms like Henry Jones and Company and others receiving a great deal of this money - money which the taxpayers of this country can ill afford to pay. This party has no objection to assistance being given to any of our primary producers, whether in respect of wheat, beef, fruit, wool, or other products. The Government belie their words by their actions every day of the week, and almost every hour of the day. They pretend to push off Socialism with the right- shoulder, while at the same time accepting it on the left. The Prime Minister of Great Britain said, &#34; We do not believe in playing with- Socialism ; we are going for it outright, and intend to do- the honest thing in the eyes of the public.&#34; What is good for one section of the community in this country is good for another, and we on this side a-re prepared to support, this Bill, even though we may not understand the elaborate explanation given by the Treasurer. </para>

              <para>- I have never objected to any one assisting the primary producers, but I do object to the Prime Minister and the Government refusing me an opportunity to show my appreciation of the people on- the land. The Government come along with legislation which is solely in the interests of the monopolists&#39; of Australia-, and when we attempt to discuss it they either apply the &#34; gag &#34; to members of this party, or close down the House. We can make no effective protest against their action in assisting the monopolists, or their inaction in not assisting- the people whom their masters who- sit in the corner - the so-called Country party - pretend torepresent. It is said that the primary producer plants everything, and I have no doubt that the Leader of the Country party-be being a medical man - has planted his mistakes well and effectively. In company with several of the members who sit behind the Government,. I recently had the opportunity of travelling through the fruit-growing districts of Australia. Throughout we were struck with the appalling conditions confronting the fruit-growers. &#34;We came into contact with settlers who bitterly complained of having spent their money and the best years of their lives toiling day after day to develop the fruit industry, yet receiving no relief. The Government, although supposedly representing country interests, are doing nothing to help these people, who are compelled to sell their farms and fruit blocks owing to the lack of financial assistance. But, on the other hand, we find that Henry Jones and Company, and other such firms, are living on the best of the land, and waxing fat. There is no doubt about how those gentlemen live, but there i&#39;s a great deal of doubt about the living conditions of the fruit-growers of Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania. The apple-growers of Tasmania are, as it were, being squeezed to a pulp, as are their apples, by the very gentlemen whom this measure proposes to help. Into whose pocket will this subsidy be paid? Is there in Australia one f ruit-grower who to-day is reaping any benefit from it? </para>

              <para>- From the so-called fruit-grower of Sussex -street, Sydney; from the middleman of Victoria who manipulates the market, and, at the expense of the consumer, wrings huge profits from the primary producer. Those are the men who stand behind this Government. They are the masters controlling the destiny of the country, while this Government is in power. They rob not only the producer, but the consumer as well. I have no desire to &#34; stone-wall &#34; the measure, but merely place on record my opinion., and my advocacy of the producer and consumer of fruit in Australia. Well we know the tactics indulged in by Henry Jones and Company, Taylor Brothers, and the O.K. people to catch the poor unfortunate consumer. Henry Jones and Company, not content with the ordinary method of advertising, induced the people to use their jams by offering prizes for successful competitions in limericks. Taylor Brothers also advertised right and left that a prize would be given for the best limerick supplied by users of their jams. </para>

          <para>Mr.CHARLTON (Hunter) &#91;8.49}.- This clause sets out the conditions as to purchase of fruit and canning. It provides that the Government can pay bounty on the quantity of fruit purchased from the orchardist, and in the event of the fruit not being canned, that the canner shall refund the amount of bounty received. Then, provision is made that, notwithstanding any contained in the clause, in certain cases the Minister may direct that there is no need to refund the bounty paid. There might be circumstances that would warrant the Minister in exercising his prerogative in regard to the refund of portion of the bounty, but as the clause stands. I am not sure that it does not go too far. I quite agree that bounty should be paid on fruit that is canned; but in the event of a man having canned only half the fruit purchased by him,it wouldbe fair to require him to refund half the bounty be had received.Under this provision, however, the Minister could allow him to retain the whole of it. This clause might lead to a person obtaining bounty on a large quantity of fruit that he did not can. </para>

              <para>- That means that if a man purchased 100 tons of fruit, canned 50 tons, and disposed of the other 50 tons as fresh fruit in the open market, the Minister, if satisfied, could say that the bounty paid on the whole quantity of fruit purchased should not be refunded. Prom the point of view of equity, that should not be the position. The clause needs amendment. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of subclause 4 should be amended to provide that the Minister might direct that noncompliance with the conditions specified in sub-clauses 1 and 2 should not disentitle the canner to receive bounty on the quantity actually canned.

            <para>. - I think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton is under a misapprehension as to this provision. The clause provides that if a. canner purchases a less quantity of fruit than that directed by the ComptrollerGeneral in pursuance of clause 6 of the Bill, he shall not be entitled to be paid bounty in respect of any of the fruit canned by him. That means an absolute forfeiture of the whole of the bounty. Then the clause goes on to provide that if a canner does not use, for canning or in the preparation of an article for human consumption, the whole of the fruit purchased by him in pursuance of clause 6, and passed as suitable for canning, he shall not be entitled to be paid bounty in respect of any of the fruit canned by him. The first object is to see that the canner does not purchase a less quantity than is directed by the Comptroller-General. Then the clause proceeds to make sure that the fruit which is purchased is canned. It provides that if the canner has been paid bounty to which, by virtue of either of the two preceding sub-sections he isnot entitled, the Comptroller- General may notify the canner that he is not satisfied that the conditions have bean complied with, and may require the canner, within fourteen days of the notice, to repay the amount of the bounty, which shall be a recoverable debt. It is conceivable that conditions might ariseu nder which it would be</inline> impracticable for the canner to have used all the fruit for canning purposes, and in that event relief should be afforded him. Sub-clause 4 therefore provides that, where the Minister is satisfied that it is not practicable for the conditions to be complied with, he may relieve the canner of the liability to repay the whole or any portion of the bounty. </para>

              <para>- He gets no bounty except on fruit he has canned. This clause deals with the whole of the season&#39;s output. The canner gets a bounty on what he cans during the season. Circumstances may arise which will prevent him from canning the whole of the fruit that he has purchased. If the provisions of sub-clause 4 of clause 8 were not inserted he might, in such a case, lose the whole of his bounty. To avoid that position the Minister is given a discretion. If he is satisfied that compliance with the conditions specified is not practicable he may relieve the canner of the obligation to repay the whole of the bounty, but the canner will only receive bounty on the amount of fruit that he actually cans. It would not be equitable to compel a canner to refund the whole of his bounty because circumstances make it impossible for him to can the whole of the fruit that he has purchased. The object of the clause is to make him purchase a certain quantity of fruit, and to can all the fruit he buys, but the provision of sub-clause 4 is a necessary and equitable protection. </para>

              <para>- The reason for that sub-clause is that the canner must buyall the fruit that is offering of a suitable quality, which he is directed to buy. There may, however, be some good reason for not canning it all. For instance, the fruit may become unfit for consumption. In that case it would be unfair to compel him to forfeit the whole of the bounty. As the clause is drafted it provides for equitable treatment for all. The arrangement which the clause seeks to cover has worked quite smoothly and well. </para>

            <para>. - I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has drawn attention to this clause, otherwise the Bill might have been passed without any discussion. The crux of the matter as it concerns the fruitgrower is in schedule 3 of the Bill, which makes it obligatory for the canners to pay the fruit-growers a certain minimum price for the fruit they buy. If the canners do that the Government will pay a certain bounty, first in respect of fruit for home consumption, and secondly in respect of fruit for export. The clause under discussion is fairly framed to give effect to the intention of the Government. When this bounty schemewas formulated it was considered that much more fruit would be produced than could be consumed locally, but I understand that the crop has not been of the volume that was anticipated. Consequently, hopes of a very large export trade will not materialize. I think that the Government should have protected itself in this respect. There is now no necessity for the protection because the anticipated very large crop did not materialize, but it should have been provided by compelling the canners, in order to get the bounty, to buy even more fruit than they wanted. </para>

              <para>- That is also the intention of the clause under discussion, and it clearly does it. The other points of interest to me are when, where, and how this money is being paid. The obligation was entered into by the Government without the approval of Parliament, in the pious hope that Parliament would give its approval after the event. I do not know what would have happened if Parliament had not doneso. However, I have already expressed my general concurrence with the scheme. It is my hope that this Bill will clear up the very grave muddles and losses that occurred in connexion with previous fruit pools. There is a very marked distinction between the objects of this measure and the administration of previous fruit pools, which were carried  out under  &#39;Government supervision. In their case the Government carried  the  whole of the load and accepted the  Whole  of the  risk.  Now, however, the Government  have  got rid of their controland responsibility,  and  have placed it on  the  canners and fruitgrowers themselves. This is all  to  the good in connexion  with  the administration of public  affairs.  I have already expressed my approval of the  main  principles of the Bill. I understand now that the bounty upon fruit canned for internal consumption can be claimed immediately the fruit is canned,  but  that the  bounty  upon canned fruit for export  cannot be  obtained until the export has been  con- summated.  In such circumstances the third schedule is obsolete, because the fruit-growershave already received the minimumamount of moneyto which they are entitled,as set outin that schedule. Altogether, inspite of the fact that  the  Government tooktookvery grave risk of hawing this Bill rejected by Parliament, seeing that its purpose is to clear up  a  very sad and tragic muddle, and to  put  the fruit trade on  a  very  much  better basis, particularly in regard to export. I am glad that it has been received with a greatmeasure of approval by both sides of the House, and I hopethat it will have thedirect effect of building up a big export trade in canned fruit, that will not only prevent the glutsof the past, but also  give  very much more hope for the future. </para>

            <para>.- The observations of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> were not distinctly relevant to the argument submitted by the Leaderof theOpposition (Mr.Charlton), which remains intact notwithstanding what has been said by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> Criticism has been addressed to the general principles of the Bill, but I must not now concern myself with those general principles more than to give them a passing refer ence on the ground that this is one of the numerous instances in which a nonsocialistic Country party has compelled its non-socialisticspouse, the Nationalist party, to bring forward advanced Socialistic proposals for the specialbenefit of the constituents of some of the wealthiest of our country friends. The point raised by the Leaderof the Opposition consti tutes sound criticism. Although the first; part of the clause -contains elaborate provisions laying down the conditions under which the bountymay be paid, and as to the amount of fruit that must be purchased and the quantity that must be canned, in the latter part of the clause, as my leader has rightly pointed out, the wholeof these precautions are wiped out and everything is left to the discretion of the Minister for the time being. The members of the Labour party never object to a wisely considered scheme of State enterprise, and they have always endeavoured to be consistent and honest incarrying out that policy, but they also like, in thesematters,to be logical. Theyrealize that a certain measure of discretion is necessary in administration, but in this case there is a very wide opening forgrave abusein thefact that, although nominally -conditions are made under which certain things may be done, the door is actually left open for all sorts of secret influences to be brought to bear upon the Minister for the time being. The bounty is to be paid secretly for reasons and under conditions and under influences of winch the public generally is totally unaware. If there is anything in the arguments to which honorable members of theCountry partyhave given publicity in the press about the abuses that creep in where there is Government interference with private enterprise, I remind my honorable friends that in this Bill they are opening &#39;the door very wide fortheMud of abuses they are constantly deploring. I know the difficulties confrontingthe Government. I knowthat they have tomake concessions to their friends in the comer, and that in their -turn honorable members in the corner have to make compromises with their own consciences, but I am aspproaching this matter in a spirit of Christian f orebearance, and I leave the issue to them to settle for themselves. </para>

          <para class="block">I have no objection to the stabilization of our fruit industry, orof primary production of any kind, by legislative action. I believe that when we reach the stage of governing our industries, both primary andsecondary, in the interests of the whole of the people, there will not be such a great outcry against the -socialization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Whenever any section gets into a hole it has to come to the Government to spoon feed it. Whether it be primary production, secondary production, or finance, the Government in the last analysis has to be the sheet anchor of those who are employed when difficulties are encountered. Here we are endeavouring to make the fruit industry more profitable for those who are engaged in it. I shall have no objection to that if it means the conferring of a benefit upon all the people. I was in Sydney a week or more ago, and my wife was astonishedat the price which was being asked there for fresh fruit. Apples were being retailed at 6d. each. If any honorable member were to go through the districts in which apples are grownhe would find the orchards strewn with a carpet of apples that have fallen from the trees. How muchof this bounty will reach the consumer ? I invite honorable members of theCountry party -to say how this measure will affect the big body of consumers, who would furnish the best market for the producers if they could only be reached without the intervention of the big man. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> made a speech which I know was prompted by &#39;his practical knowledge of the canning industry. It is up to us to say a word for the hard worker, who has to buy the fruit. In what way will the canning of this fruit assure to the householder a cheaper or a better class of canned or fresh fruit ? There is no assurance in the Bill. I hope that action similar to this will be taken in dealing with the workers, when the opportunity presents itself, in order that the cost of commodities shall not be raised to such an extent as to make ineffective an increase of a few shillings a week inwages. The Bill lays it down that the producer is to be given a minimum wage. That is a principle which did not find favour when we first enunciated it. </para>

            <para>. - I rise to assure the honorable &#39;member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> that the Bill contains adequate safeguards for the consumer and producer alike. The bounty on home consumption was devised specially to permit of the sale of the fruit in Australia during this year at the reduced price of 101/2d. per 2-lb. tin. The definite agreement was arrived at among the canners that they would continue to sell to the retailer at such a rate as would enable him to carry on at that price. I am pleased to see that the action of the cannershas led to arrangements being made for the consumption of a greater quantity of fruit . in Australia thanwas expected. Apparently, 80 per cent. of this pack will be consumed in Australia, and it was thought that only 70 per cent. would be so consumed. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The consumer in Australia will be further protected in that only 30 per cent. of this pack will be allowed to be sent outside the country, except with the definite consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs, so as to insure that thereshall be an abundant supply in Australia. The consumer isalso protected under clauses 6 and 8, which provide that, as a necessary condition to his receiving the bounty, the canner shall accept and can practically all the fruit presented at his cannery. There will not, therefore, be any possibility of an artificial shortage being brought about, with a consequent raising of prices. </para>

              <para>- Yes. In those three ways special provision has been made that the consumer shall benefit, because the Government felt that on this occasion it should use the money that is being spent to popularize Australian fruit in Australia and make it as widely used as possible. This is no more a socialistic proposal than any other scheme for giving a bounty. Whatever tendency towards socialism it may have, it is a long step from the socialism of previous Pools, which consisted of Government purchase and control from the time the fruit came off the tree until it was placed in the various homes. </para>

That is the result of the efforts of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> while in England,. in disposing of the big surplus that existed there. He managed to insure that it would be distributed through 4,000 shops, in order to give us a good advertisement. Reference has been made to the amount that has been paid. At the present time by way of bounty on home production <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40,000</inline> has been paid, and an additional &#163;35,000 has been passed for payment. No money has been paid on fruit exported, but I understand that an account has been sent in for &#163;6,000. It is anticipated that the total amount which will be payable will be between &#163;115,000 and &#163;125,000. </para>

            <para>. -I hope the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> -will persist in his proposed amendment. I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 4. If the object of this Bill was to lay down a prin ciple for a number of years, the cancellation of the more or less mandatory pro-, visions of sub-clauses 1 and 2 would perhaps be justifiable. On the Treasurer&#39;s figures fully two-thirds of the bounty of &#163;150,000 has been paid, or passed for payment. The Minister ought to know, and it would appear from the Treasurer&#39;s statement that he does know, what amount will be claimed for bounty. He should also know who will come under the provisions of sub-clause 4. The facts could be ascertained, and if that were done there would be no need for the sub-clause. The object desired could be achieved by some clearer and more definite method. Parliament ought to know to whom the sub-clause refers and what amounts are involved. The sub-clause is inserted, I submit, to meet specific cases, which must be known to the Minister. Practically all the bounty for home consumption has been paid, and a large part of the bounty for export has been submitted and passed for payment. We were told in the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech that this Bill would finalize the matter; that it did not seek to provide any further bounties, but dealt only with specific cases. I am inclined to look upon the sub-clause with a certain amount of suspicion. There is just a chance that it is inserted to meet special cases which the Minister or the Government does not wish to disclose to the House. I hope the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition will be moved and carried, because it will clarify the position, and show us exactly where we stand. </para>

            <para>-In this debate there is evidently something wanting. I would like to know the Government&#39;s real intentions. I have never heard a more lame reply to criticism than that which was given by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman).</inline> The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> suggested that there was a hidden motive in this subclause 4, and it appears to me that something is being smothered, and that the real purpose of the Bill is not being disclosed. Everything necessary for human consumption can be produced in abundance in Australia, but we have not yet ascertained from the Government how the good things provided by Providence can be distributed. The Labour party&#39;s platform lays, down cardinal principles in that connexion. Unfortunately, the abuse of  that policy by followers of the Government, and the opposition of self-interested persons, prevent its realization, but until we can get the socialization of the means of production, Bills of this character will be brought regularly before us. Large bounties were passed during the last Parliament. All kinds of bounties have been proposed to meet circumstances as they arise. Thus an attempt is made to obscure the necessity for socializing the means of production. I am satisfied that until we take the step proposed by the Labour party we shall not get out of our difficulties. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> referred to the price of fruit in Sydney. In the last two years it has been very difficult to buy good fruit in Sydney. The best quality is very scarce. A lot of the best fruit is shipped from New South Wales, for it does not pay to export anything but the best. Even second rate fruit, however, is not readily obtainable. Good quality grapes, which are greatly enjoyed by women and children, have not been obtainable for two years. I am sorry that the Government has not tried to do something for the Australian consumer. The Bill gives me an opportunity to refer to a speech delivered by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> in a suburb of Melbourne a few weeks ago. He said that the handing out of bounties to the third party in this House would have to stop. The practice has become a disgrace to the Government of this country. I do not intend to vote against this Bill becauseI quite recognise that the speeches that have been made by honor- able members opposite were merely some of the electioneering speeches to which we shall continue to listen if this Parliament . lasts for another twelve months. The speech which the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> made this afternoon, in moving the adjournment of the House, was nothing more nor less than an electioneering speech. Politicians quite understood that. This Bounty Bill is only an electioneering squib, which has afforded honorable members opposite an opportunity to express their concern for the poor man on the land. It makes me very wrath to listen to the way in which some honorable members speak of our country people. The statements they make are sufficient to prevent any one going upon the land, and if read in. the Old Country would be sufficient to pre vent persons coming to Australia in order to settle upon the land. We should put a stop to this kind of thing. If men on the land are faced with difficult conditions, they should come to honorable members on this side, who will find some relief for them. I hope that the explanation which has been given by the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> is correct, but I can scarcely believe it. The Bill is fax too loosely drawn. Bills of this character should be drawn in such a way that ordinary individuals can understand them. I guarantee that not one-half of the members of the Committee know what is contained in the clause now under consideration. We should have much less trouble in passing measures in this House if they were clearly drawn. Honorable members opposite have reason to be grateful for the criticism of this measure by honorable members on this side. It has induced the Attorney-General to explain what the Bill really means. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> told us about an agreement, but has any honorable member seen the agreement? When we are asked to pass a Bill which covers an agreement, we should be told what is in that agreement. Whether it is in accordance with the Bill or not may depend on the person who drew it up. I still doubt whether the agreement in this case is consistent with the statements which have been made by the Treasurer and the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

              <para>- Yet the honorable member proposes to pass a Bill which covers the agreement, although it may be contrary to his opinion. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> will persist in securing information upon measures submitted in this Chamber, so that before a Bill is passed into law we shall know what it contains. I know what happens when one has&#39; to make application to a Government Department. I know that if he has the ear of the Minister he will have no difficulty in securing what he desires. This makes me anxious to know what we. are passing in this Bill. We should be careful with the ex- penditure  of public funds because, airthough, we are receiving a greater revenue through the Customs than we should receive in that way, money is not as plentiful as it used to be in the old days when, in the State which I represent, if the Government was a little short of money, it sold land. In these times,., when we have to obtain revenue by taxation, we should be particularly careful to know what we are doing when  Ave  are called&#39; upon to pass measures of this character. </para>

I should like to- see them a little more consistent.- In connexion with Customs legislation, they have passed measure after measure containing a similar provision, enabling the Minister for Trade and Customs to give to one person what he will not give another. In the past, honorable members- opposite have supported, such provisions with great con.sistency. In the circumstances,. I am greatly surprised that now, when we have before us a clause enabling the Minister for Trade and&#39; Customs, to tell one man that he will receive the bonus and anr other that he will not receive it, honorable members opposite should be found opposing it.. They have often supported similar legislation before, and I cannot understand their opposition in this case. </para>

Unless some good reason cart be given to the contrary, the Minister should be prepared to accept the amendment. I do not want to divide the Committee upon it, but merely desire to protect the public. The drafting of the clause is anything but satisfactory. It is not sufficient to say that the Minister has, to decide the matter, for we all know how skilful some people are when dealing with the Government, and it is possible for the Minister, even with the best of intentions, to give a wrong decision. In connexionwith meat, we were careful to pay only on the quantity exported; and in this Bill we should provide for the bounty to be paid only on the fruit canned&#34;. </para>

              <para>- The Bill provides that the . money received need not be returned to the Treasury. If the bounty is paid only after the fruit is canned, what is the meaning of that provision? The thing is self-evident; it is there in black and white, and in argument to-night it has been admitted that payment is made on the fruit bought. If it is the intention of the Department to protect the public, and to pay only on the fruit canned, I can only say that that intention is badly expressed in the drafting of the clause. </para>

Subclause 1 reads : &#34;If the canner purchases a less quantity of fruit than that directed by the Comptroller-General. . . . &#34; That is to insure that the canner purchases the fruit. Sub-clause 2 provides that if a. canner does not use, for canning or in the- preparation of an article for human consumption, the whole of the fruit purchased by him and passed by an inspector as suitable for canning, then he is liable to a penalty, namely, the forfeiture of the bounty paid in respect of any of the fruit canned by him. No bounty is paid at all except for fruit that is absolutely canned, and no bounty is paid upon fruit being canned until the canner receives the certificate of an officer that the conditions have been complied with.

              <para>- The Minister read for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition a certificate to show that no money is paid until the fruit has been canned and inspected. How is it that it is possible for a canner to be paid a bounty to which he is not entitled? The Minister has produced a certificate to prove that a canner cannot be paid the bounty until he has canned the quantity, of fruit certified by the inspector ; yet the Bill provides for payment, which is not to be made until the fruit is canned. </para>

              <para>- I fail to see why a  man  should have money paid to him until he has completed his contract.  The Bill is loosely drawn, since sub-clause (3) stipulates that the canner is, in certain circumstances, to return some qf the money that has been paid to him. I  wish to know how a man can obtain money for the recovery of which there is a claim at law. The Minister has not yet explained the position to my satisfaction. </para>

              <para>- The Minister nods. I therefore take it that the suggestion of the honorable member for Echuca is correct. How does the canner reimburse himself? The grower&#39;s interests are well protected, because if half the fruit goes rotten, the grower will have already obtained the higher price paid by virtue of the bounty. I am inclined to think that the Leader of the Opposition has placed his finger on the weak spot in the Bill. Apparently the money has been paid, and as the numbers are up, the Minister is disinclined to listen to the words of wisdom falling from the Opposition. Perhaps some of the money that has been paid by way of bounty has not been earned, and the canners who have secured it are disinclined to refund it. It may be that some of the canners have not fulfilled their contracts. If so, this measure is typical of the actions of the Government in spending the taxpayers&#39; money. </para>

              <para>- Then why not accept the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition, which states definitely that no bounty shall be paid in respect of fruit that is not canned? I suppose the Government are not absolutely wedded to the verbiage of this Bill, though, on the other hand, they may think it is perfect. In any case I compliment them upon bringing in the measure. It is a step in the direction of Socialism which  we  are very glad to see them take.  We  must, however, commiserate with honorable members opposite upon the failure of private enterprise to stand alone. They admit now that private enterprise in conjunction with Government enterprise is a good thing. In the early days of this Government many gibes were heard about fig-leaf Socialism. The only difference that I can see in the Government now is that they propose to exchange the fig-leaf for the apricot-leaf, or the peach-leaf. Even the pineapple-leaf is mentioned. I do not think that the Government are showing much discretion. The first tailoress in the world selected the figleaf as the best form of armour against nakedness, and I do not think that the Government would be wise to discard the fig-leaf, especially for a pineapple-leaf. I am sure that they would not find the pineapple-leaf any more comfortable. However, we congratulate them upon recognising the principle that Government enterprise is not a bad thing. </para>

            <para>.- I believe that the intentions of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and other honorable members opposite who have spoken on this matter are honorable. They desire to safeguard the public purse. I consider, however, thatthe acceptance of the amendment movedby theLeader of the Opposition would defeat thevery purpose he has in mind. Clause 6 of the Bill provides that if the canner purchases the fruit offered bythe grower, pays the grower  for  the fruit, and cans it to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall be paid a bounty. Clause 8 provides that ifhe does not canthe whole of the fruit to the satisfaction off the Minister he may be obliged to refund thebounty that has been paid in respect to the fruit that he has canned. He may be relieved of that liability if he satisfies the Ministerthat compliance with the specified conditions is not practicable. The Leader of the Opposition,with the best intentions in the world, wishes to relieve the canner of all liability to repaythat money. That, at anyrate, willbe the effect of his amendment  if  itis adopted. I do not think he intends that the canner should berelieved of any responsibility to refund money that has been paid when the conditions underwhich the money was paid are not fulfilled. </para>

          <para class="block">In accordance with the provisions of the Act I lay on the tableof the House a statement setting out the nature of the work,together with plans and specifications and other necessary papers. The volume of traffic between Sydney and Newcastle and Newcastle andWest Maitland necessitates a large number of additional wires. The provision of these by open wire and poles is impracticable since the space available along the railway route, where the existing wires are erected, is inadequate for the number required. Moreover, the estimated cost of erection of the required lines and strengthening existing pole : routes is &#163;858,600. In order,therefore, to meetthe Department&#39;s requirements, it is proposed to provide a cablebetween Sydney and Newcastlecontaining 200 wires, and between Newcastle andWest Maitland a cable containing 100 wires immediately, and another cable containing 100 wires in ten years&#39;time. The number of wires providedwill allow forthe ultimate provision between Sydney and Newcastle andNew- castle and West Maitland of 150 telephone circuits.

          <para>.- I have been asked by a number of Public Service organizations to ascertain, if possible, f rom theGovernment its intentions with regard to the question of&#39; State instrumentalities and their claims to the right of access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. This is a matter of very great concern to many organizations with which I am in touch inNew South Wales, and unless the Government announces its intentions considerable expense will be involved by those organizations in making applications to the Court. The attention of the. organizations  has  been directed to the fact that negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth Government and the Attorneys-General of New South Wales and Victoria. That fact, of course, lends colour to the general opinion inNew South Wales that this Government proposes to legislate to exclude public servants from the Federal Court. I should like to hear a statement from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> on this very important matter. </para>

            <para>- While we go out and wave flags; and beat drums, and talk about our patriotic fervour, the Government compels workmen who are upon the basic wage- a wage which was fixed merely to cover the bare cost of living - to take a day off at the expense, not of the patriotic Government, but of their wives and children, That was the experience of the employees at Cockatoo Island, on the occasion of the visit of the fleet to Sydney. The Prime Minister told me today that the Government had no power over the Commonwealth Shipping Board&#39;, but I say that the Government has every power. It cannot shelter itself behind that excuse. If it wished to act fairly it could reimburse the Shipping Board for the payment of the money.. For years it was the practice to pay these men for public holidays, but not since the advent of the Shipping Board. I appeal to the Prime Minister to see that the grievance is removed. If- the Board will not pay the money, let the Government make a special grant for the purpose. I believe that Parliament would readily acquiesce-. If the Government is as patriotic as it would have us believe, it will take steps to see that the workmen do not suffer by being compelled to lose a day&#39;s work to honour our visiting kinsmen. </para>

        <para>I wish to refer to another matter in connexion with the Shipbuilding Tribunal. That Tribunal has been in existence for many years.

When he was  chairman  the decisions of the Tribunal were always made public, but recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Connington</inline> resigned, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair,</inline> who is also a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, was appointed in his place. Since that change was made the awards have been kept secret, and officials of the unions concerned have not been able to obtain copies. I ask the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> whose Department controls this matter, to look into it, and have the awards of the Tribunal made available to the secretaries and officials of the unions directly concerned. </para>

          <para>. - I do not understand the anxiety that is felt at the present moment on the subject brought forward by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman).</inline> It will be within the honorable member&#39;s knowledge that the question of the relation of State instrumentalities to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been constantly raised by the State Governments for a number of years. I also point out to him that the Government can hardly be expected to make a declaration of its policy in reply to a question raised on a motion for the adjournment of the House. I can only say to him that at the moment there is no statement I can make, or that I desire to make, on the matter. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Dalley (Mr: Mahony) addressed to me this afternoon a question regarding the holiday granted to certain workmen in connexion with the visit of the Special Service Squadron. I pointed out to him then that this House deliberately took from the Government the control of the conditions of work in the Cockatoo Dockyard and placed it in the hands of a Board, which is entirely responsible for the position in which the men find themselves. If it is desired to submit a special case, and representations are made, they will naturally be considered. It is entirely for the Board to determine the conditions under which the men are employed, since the. Government - by, I again remind the honorable member, the expressed determination of Parliament - has had removed from its control all questions relating to these men. </para>
        <para>Regarding the alteration in the practice relating to the publication <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> awards of the Special Tribunal- for Cockatoo Dockyard, I will have the matter looked into, and will let the honorable member know the exact position. </para>
