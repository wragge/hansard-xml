           <para>-I have seen Press reports of what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> is alleged to have said in a speech made in London. I have also seen one Press report which attributes certain reactions to me. I do not know from where the writer of the latter report derived his information, because I certainly made no comment on the matter nor indicated any attitude to it. My former ministerial colleague is a man of considerable ability, judgment and experience. He is a devoted son of Australia and a staunch friend of Great Britain. Anything he would say on a matter of such importance to our two countries would be said in a helpful spirit and as a statement of the facts as they appeared to him. We have learned to be wary in this place of Press truncations of substantial speeches. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> make no further comment on the matter. </para>

                    <para>My colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry is proceeding to London shortly for the purpose of discussing important matters of trade between the two countries, and no doubt he will be able to canvass to some considerable degree with the United Kingdom the question of Britain's general intentions in relation to the Common Market. There is no question that Britain's entry to the Common Market could have quite serious effects, as attributed in the reported statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Downer, for certain specific Australian industries, quite apart from the overall effect. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> is reported to have mentioned dried fruits, canned fruits, dairy products and various other primary products. This is well known to members of the House, but I am sure that we can feel confident that the United Kingdom would not go into the European Common Market without having weighed very carefully the effect on various members of the Commonwealth of Nations and having provided those members with adequate opportunities to exchange views on these matters. </para>

                        <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Is it a fact that the cost per mile per passenger for the economy class Qantas fare between Sydney and Honolulu works out at 7.63 cents, whilst the cost between Honolulu and San Francisco is 4.1 cents? As passengers fly along the route in the same aircraft and with the same pilots, and are often greeted by the same air hostesses, will the Minister explain the difference in the cost per mile? </para>

                        <para>- I can vouch for the accuracy of the figures given by the honorable member because I provided them in a letter I sent to him only a few days ago. The subject of average fares between various centres and over total routes is a fairly difficult and delicate one. Basically the fares are arranged originally and agreed to by the countries concerned after discussions in the International Air Transport Association. Perhaps the honorable member has seen some reference lately to publicity by Qantas and Canadian Pacific with regard to fares over Pacific routes. This matter will be discussed at great length at the InterAir Transport Association conference which will be held in September. I know of the honorable member's interest in this subject after the travel conference he attended overseas recently. I cannot comment on the actual basis of calculation because this is a matter that is discussed at great length in the International Air Transport Association and agreed to by the various countries. It is a matter for negotiation between the countries and involves many other matters. I think I should point out that the average fare from Sydney to London and Sydney to New York, taking cents per mile as a basis, is actually lower than the average fare from New York to London. However, I can assure the honorable member that the question of fares in the Pacific area will be looked at very closely in September. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister a question. He will recall that recently a referendum was held on the proposal for a reserve price for wool, and that before the referendum was held the Government printed a pamphlet giving both sides of the case. Is the refusal of the Government to hold a referendum on the question of sending conscripts to Vietnam to be attributed, first, to the Government's fear that the referendum proposal would be rejected, so that it does not wish to give the people an opportunity to express their views on this vital issue, and secondly, to the fact that if a referendum were held the Government would be bound, under the provisions of the Electoral Act, to print a pamphlet stating both sides of the case for despatching voteless conscripts to Vietnam? Finally I ask: Is wool more important than human life? </para>

                            <para>- Of course he is still campaigning. He has also said that conscription will be made an issue at the forthcoming general election. Yet the honorable member apparently wants to have a referendum campaign sandwiched between these events. The people will be able to express their judgment on the choice available to them, both of policies and of Government, within a reasonably short space of time. I suggest to the honorable gentleman that now that he has been confirmed in his leadership he exercise a little patience so that these matters may be clearly perceived and a considered judgment delivered on them. As to the pamphlet, as I indicated yesterday I would have thought it not impossible for a political party to get its views clearly stated to the public. The honorable gentleman apparently- </para>

Government policy involving the security of the nation and the well-being of many thousands of young Australians abroad. I made it clear yesterday that the Government had no wish to obscure in any way the attitude of the Labour Party. Any obscurity proceeds from the Labour Party itself. Indeed, even in this latest effusion which has come from the honorable gentleman he seems now to have turned full circle. The version which he gave last night is very different from that which he gave on " Four Corners ", as anybody who saw that programme will be able to confirm. As to the final part of the honorable gentleman's question in which he asked whether the Australian Government places wool above human life, it is so typically contemptible, coming from the honorable gentleman opposite, as not to merit a serious reply. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for the Interior a question. In view of the dilapidated condition of the Federal members' rooms in Melbourne and the fact that a fire occurred in the old lift well during this week, necessitating the evacuation of people from the building, will the Minister tell Victorian members of the Parliament when their new accommodation will be ready for occupation? Last year in the present building there were rats in the drinking water. The lift is often out of order. The toilets are really primitive. The need to finalise the new accommodation is now urgent. </para>

                        <para>- There was a small electrical fire in the Commonwealth Offices in Melbourne during the week. The only damage it did was to cause a blackout in the building. Knowing the rather lower standards of office accommodation that honorable members have to endure in Melbourne - I sympathise with them - I am sure that a blackout would not have caused much inconvenience. The Government has made a decision which has been announced. The old Customs House will be converted into office accommodation for members of Parliament and some ministerial staff. </para>

                        <para>-  Some months ago a reply to a question on the notice paper gave  exact details of the costs, but whether that answer was given in the Senate or in this chamber I do not recall. The actual cost involved to the point arrived at in preparing for the referendum was in the vicinity of $200,000. To hold a referendum in Australia generally costs $H million. This includes the cost of preparing the case and its distribution, the rental of halls and the payment of the electoral officers required to carry out the referendum. </para>

                        <para>- This matter has been considered on a number of occasions within the Department. The cost of providing telephones in some of the outlying areas is far greater than it is in the metropolitan areas or in areas closer to high density population. We believe that the present arrangement is equitable as between the general body of telephone subscribers and those who live in the distant areas. We regret the need to throw a responsibility on to persons who must provide some of their own lines, but it must be realised as well that these people enjoy a considerably reduced rental compared with subscribers in the high density population areas. </para>

Is it a fact that the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organisation, U Thant, frequently moves about the world in his search for world peace? Has an invitation ever been issued to this outstanding world personality to visit Australia? If not, is there any special reason for the Government not doing so, or is it the view of the Government that no good purpose would be served by such a visit? ls it also a fact that considerably interest is always shown both inside and outside the Parliament in the work of the United Nations Organisation? Will the Prime Minister consider inviting the Secretary-General to come here so that all members of the Parliament as well as members of other organisations may have the opportunity of meeting and hearing his views on world peace? </para>

                        <para>-  I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I ask: In view of the fact that the Opposition's Parliamentary Caucus publicly announced in February 1965 that the American decision to undertake air bombing of targets in North Vietnam was then deserving of " sympathetic Australian understanding", can the right honorable gentleman inform the House, in the light of his recent visit to South Vietnam, whether there has been any change in the military situation since February 1.965 such as would justify last night's volte face by the armchair strategists of the Opposition in telling the Government of the United States of America to stop such bombing? </para>

                            <para>- I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would welcome some wider public dissemination of the decision that apparently was taken with the authority of his caucus last night. It appears that the caucus has now finally caught up with the original version of the statement of policy that came from the Leader of the Opposition. In answering the question, I would say that the change is not so much in the military situation as in the situation inside the Australian Labour Party. The Australian Labour Party of today and ils policies are clearly very different from those of the period to which the honorable gentleman refers. Perhaps one of the more significant symptoms of this change was the recent decision of the Federal Executive to remove from the Foreign Policy Committee of the Australian Labour Party- </para>

                            <para>- I do no" want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily. Quite clearly, the implications of the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition last night must not only be most carefully studied but must also be the subject of extensive comment. If the policy proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, with (he full authority of his Party, were to be implemented at any future time, the effective functioning of the Australian Army in theatres of military operation would be destroyed. This must be clearly understood by the Australian people. National servicemen are part of regular units of the Australian Army and are engaged in theatres of war, not merely in Vietnam but also in Borneo and elsewhere. The military structures in these areas would be completely disrupted and, if the 30 per cent, national service component - taking the overall figure - were to be hastily removed, as the honorable gentleman proposes. Australia would not have an effective fighting unit, in any of these areas in which our own national interests are involved. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that I must ask the Prime Minister a question. Has the Prime Minister seen yesterday's reported statement by the United States Secretary of Defence to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the effect that desertions and defections from the South Vietnamese Army are running at a " very, very high rate " and the problem is serious? How many more Australian mothers' sons are to be conscripted to fill the widening gaps in the ranks of the South Vietnam Army? Why are Australians expected to shed their blood in a cause in which so many of the defending country's citizens apparently have so little faith? The Prime Minister speaks about withdrawing Australians from this theatre of war. What about the citizens of this country withdrawing from the war? </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman clearly reveals his ignorance of the situation in Vietnam. Not only have the South Vietnamese been fighting a struggle for their own independence for something approaching 20 years, but today literally hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, including women in certain situations, are engaged in this struggle for survival. What the honorable gentleman ought to realise is that these so-called desertions are not desertions as we understand the term. Honorable members opposite are interjecting. I know that this is all very funny to them, but that is because they refuse to make any responsible or realistic appreciation of the situation there. Tens of thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands - of those serving there have been drawn from agricultural pursuits in that country. From time to time considerable numbers of them return to their own village at the harvest period. They then return to the forces after his job has been done. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Have the relevant officers in his Department made any assessment of the effect on voluntary recruitment of proclaiming the war in Vietnam to be dirty, unwinnable and immoral? Further, should this view of the war in Vietnam be endorsed by the Australian electorate, can he say whether any assessment has been made of the strength of any Australian force that might be maintained on a voluntary basis in Vietnam under these conditions, apart, of course, from the logic of maintaining any force there at all in such circumstances? Finally, can he say whether his military planners have given any thought to the consequences of this development for the A.N.Z.U.S. alliance and any alternative defence arrangements that might have to be made for this country? </para>

                        <para>-  I think it will be understood that it is almost impossible to make an assessment of the effect of statements such as those which have come from the Opposition during the last two or three months; but if must also be understood, I am sure, that this continues to sow confusion in the public mind. Confusion in the public mind is just as powerful a weapon in aid of the Communists as anything they have in the field. I am sure that it will equally be understood that if the policy announced by the Labour Party last night were to be put into effect - I sincerely hope it will not be put into effect and I believe it will not because the public of Australia will understand the issue too clearly - inevitably we would be required to reduce our commitment to Vietnam to a point which would certainly be not an adequate response to our treaty obligations. These things will be watched very carefully. But the Government would stand appalled at the effect on our allies, the effect on our treaty obligations and the long term effect on the safety of this country if we were forced by the acceptance of the Labour Party's policy virtually to withdraw our effort in Vietnam. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to be able to tell the House that while in South Vietnam I was able to take some action to expedite the release of the ribbon to be worn by those returning from that country after a qualifying period of service. I found that it was necessary to obtain the approval of  Her  Majesty the Queen for the design, and that matter was then being considered. However, I believed that it would be reasonable to gamble on approval being given for the design submitted, since failure to place orders for the weaving of the fabric might have delayed the issue of the ribbon until after the impending return of the Australian battalion from Vietnam. I am happy to say that this gamble was justified in the result, because  Her  Majesty has since signified her approval of the design of the ribbon. I hope that it can be made available by the time the battalion that is about to return reaches Australia's shores. I am not well informed about the present stage of the design and making of the medal itself, but I shall see whether I can obtain information promptly for the honorable gentleman. </para>

                            <para>- To the best of my knowledge, the passenger and cargo trade of " Empress of Australia " between Sydney and Hobart is profitable. I have not seen the figures recently, but there is certainly no suggestion at the present time that she is to be taken off that run and put on the North Queensland trade. I should add that, inevitably,' there is a falling off in passenger trade during the winter months, but, fortunately, " Empress of Australia " derives far greater profit from her regular cargoes of goods than she does from the passenger trade. If she were to rely on passenger trade alone, I doubt whether, except for a brief period of the year, she would be able to run at a profit. </para>

                        <para>- I shall examine whether it is practicable to supply a list which will be sufficiently comprehensive for the honorable gentleman. I can clearly enough point to a number of leading military and diplomatic figures with whom I had discussions, and I shall see to what extent I can comply with the honorable member's request. Quite obviously, it was neither practicable nor desirable to do this in my statement, which already has been criticised by the Leader of the Opposition as being too detailed in other respects. The honorable gentleman asked about talks with the civilian or military leaders outside the ranks of the Government. This, of course, was clearly not practicable in the time available to me in the countries I visited. He asked me specifically about the Buddhist leader who lives some hundreds of miles from Saigon. There is in this country a great variety of groups. Where does one begin and end? Does one seek to talk to a whole range of people - trade union officials, representatives of the Catholic Church and other religious groups, of which there are many? Clearly that was not practicable. In the time available I informed  myself as fully as I could. I believe I have returned to Australia very much better informed than I would have been in the absence of any such visit. </para>

There has been a charge made that the people of Australia have not had an opportunity to vote on the national service training issue. Is it a fact that this Government was returned with strong support at the last Senate election? Is it also a fact that the issue at that election was chosen by the Leader of the Opposition and, to use his words, was the conscription issue? Is it true that the Leader of the Opposition stumped the countryside urging a conscience vote on this issue and that the Labour Party was rejected by the people of Australia? </para>

The honorable gentleman leading the Opposition has stated the grounds on which he will come to electoral battle. I can assure him that honorable members on this side of the House, who, in both panics and both Houses of this Parliament, have been unanimously behind the Government in its policies in relation to Vietnam and national service training, will face that issue with the greatest confidence. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to ask the Prime Minister a question. Is it a fact that the horribly brutal physical tortures which are inflicted on Vietcong prisoners by Vietnamese Government troops so frequently have been inflicted in the presence of Western military personnel, and quite frequently at a time when those Vietnamese Government troops are under the command of Western military personnel; that this type of torture inflicted on prisoners has been established as a crime at the Nuremburg War Trials, and is contrary to the principles we have endorsed under the Geneva arrangements relating to prisoners of war? What action has the Government taken, or will it take, to dissociate itself from this type of thing and to prevent these horrible tortures continuing? I conclude by pointing out that I am well aware that the Vietcong are not completely virtuous in this regard but we are not being asked to fight for the Vietcong. </para>

I am able to say that Prime Minister Ky has given his assurance to the United States authorities that the troops coming under the command of his Government have been clearly instructed that the terms of this convention are to be strictly observed. </para>

                        <para>.- In the last two years there have been many debates on the subject of housing. There have been debates on two Homes Savings Grant Bills, one Housing Loans Insurance Bill, three Loan (Housing) Bills and we are to have one on this amendment to the Housing Agreement Act with which we are dealing today. There have also been two debates on the estimates for the recreated Department of Housing. During all of these debates members of the Labour Party have directed attention to the principal field in which the Commonwealth has responsibility for housing - that is, under these arrangements with the States. It is in this field that the Commonwealth appropriates most of the money for housing. It is in this field, too, that the Commonwealth can exercise the greatest say in the way housing funds are spent. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Bill sets forth the conditions under which the Commonwealth will make money available to the States for housing purposes for the next five years. The debates which have taken place on the eight occasions I have listed might just as well never have taken place. The Bill before us, in fact, merely extends for another five years, without any substantial alterations, the arrangements which the Government made 10 years ago with the States and in which it made some changes from the conditions first laid down by the Labour Government in 1945. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the last 10 years there have been notable changes in conditions in housing in Australia. The cost of land has gone up greatly. Interest rates have gone up. The distances that new houses have to be built from places of employment have increased. The districts in which houses are now being built are generally more lacking in civic amenities than those elsewhere. In the last 10 years - the years that the expiring Agreement covered - it has cost more to obtain housing. It has taken longer to get between home and place of employment. It has meant that for recreation and community activities people have to spend more time and money. The Bill meets none of these changes and challenges. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline> took satisfaction in referring to the changes which were made between the first 10 year Agreement - the Labour Government's 1945-56 Agreement - and the Agreement which his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner, made in 1956. He referred to significant differences. He said that it was easier to buy houses under the new Agreement. That is certainly a change, but the present situation is, however, that three houses are let by Housing Commissions over the whole of Australia for every two that the Commissions sell. It may be that Australians do buy their own houses. The important thing is that Australians should have a choice whether they want to buy or rent a house. </para>
                    <para>It is impossible for very great numbers of our people to buy houses except from the Housing Commissions, lt is impossible for very great numbers of our people, not only because of means but also because of the mobility associated with their occupations such as teachers and engineers, to rent houses except from the Housing Commissions. The consequence - not only of the last ten years of operation of this Agreement but also of other developments in the housing field - has been that it is now more difficult to rent a house in Australia, and more expensive to buy a house, than it has ever been. Australians now have less choice in the matter of renting accommodation and more burdens in buying accommodation than have people in North America or Western Europe. Housing is more difficult for Australians to obtain than it is for citizens of any of the countries with which we compare ourselves, whether they have unitary or federal systems. </para>
                    <para>The other significant change which was made by the 1956 Agreement is that for the first two years, 20 per cent, of the overall funds, and ever since, 30 per cent, of the overall funds, has been diverted to building societies. The first portion of my amendment makes available to the Housing Commissions at least as much money as is now made available by the annual Loan (Housing) Acts for both them and the building societies. At the same time we believe that the Government should not only .make available to the building societies as much money as is now made available to them by the Loan (Housing) Act, but should require the banking and insurance systems to make available to them the same proportion of money as in earlier years. </para>
                    <para>The point we make is that the funds available for the persons to be catered for by the Housing Commissions should not be cut down in order to provide for the building societies. The building societies certainly need at least as much finance as they get now. We believe they should get more than they get now. They would get more if the Commonwealth Government properly exercised its powers over banking and insurance and superannuation funds. The Housing Commissions need all the money that is provided each year under the Loan (Housing) Bills. They used to get all the money provided under those Bills until and including 1955. The Housing Commissions in fact received more to spend in 1953-54 than in any financial year before or since. They built more houses in 1954-55 than in any year before or since. In that year the Housing Commissions built 17 per cent, of the new houses in Australia; last financial year they built 9 per cent. </para>
                    <para>Until this year the Housing Commissions never had as much to spend as they had in the last year of the 1945 Agreement. They are still unable to build as many houses in a year as they built annually during the last three years of that Agreement. So there can be no doubt that the Housing Commissions are meeting to a decreasing extent the needs of the people whom they are supposed to serve. </para>
                    <para>The building societies similarly are serving fewer of the people they are supposed to serve, lt is not easy to get the figures with regard to building societies over the period that this Government has been in office. Only in New South Wales has there been a State wide organisation to give figures showing the finance available to building societies. The building societies in some of the other States are still quite rudimentary, as this Agreement acknowledges. The New South Wales building societies received more funds by way of loans from banks, insurance companies and superannuation funds in 1949-50  -  the year in which this Government came to office - and in 1950- 51, than they have received in any year before or since. Despite increasing sums diverted from the State Housing Commission to building societies over the last 10 years, the New South Wales societies still finance fewer houses than they did in 1949- 50 and only two-thirds as many as they did in their peak year in 1951-52. Honorable members will realise that houses are usually completed in the year after that in which the funds are made available. Accordingly, the two great fields with which this Agreement deals, that of Housing Commissions and that of building societies, are in fact providing fewer houses than they did when the Government concluded this Agreement in 1956. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, to talk nonsense. It is easy for honorable members to make interjections, civil or otherwise, as the venerable gentleman has done. Every year my colleagues and I place questions on the notice paper - addressed until a couple of years ago to the Minister for National Development and since then to the Minister for Housing - seeking information on all the financial, constructional and other aspects of housing under this Agreement and the other Acts for which this Parliament is responsible. The figures I have quoted as regards Housing Commissions and those that I shall quote later have been supplied in answers given by the various Ministers to our questions. The figures I give for building societies come from the official publications of the New South Wales association of building societies. It is unfortunate that the public in general and members of Parliament are unable to secure statistics on building of houses except from ministerial answers to the questions placed on the notice paper by members of the Labour Party. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Despite our pressure for it no annual report has been published of the operation of this Agreement. We will be moving at the Committee stage for the publication of such an annual report. It takes some time for the various State departments, trusts and commissions to produce their annual reports. None of those reports for last year is yet in the Parliamentary Library. No reports are made to the Parliament and Ministers tell those of us who question them that they do not know the number of houses built for sale or rent by the building societies. Accordingly honorable members can only speculate on many aspects of demand or cost in the community in general. They can, however, rely on figures given by State departments as to demand, after some lapse of time; they can, furthermore, derive from answers to questions some ideas of cost. </para><para>The Parliament is to be given annual reports under the Homes Savings Grants Act and the Housing Loans Insurance Act. It has for a long time been receiving reports each year under the War Service Homes Act. lt does not receive reports under the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act or the Aged Persons Homes Act. Honorable members know the benefits that can be derived from an annual report as distinct from an answer to a question. An answer to a question must be limited to a few factual matters. Matters of opinion, views of experts and qualified officers cannot be elicited by questions; they can be gleaned only from reports. Accordingly 1 hope that the Government will belatedly but gracefully accept our proposition that the Parliament should receive an annual report from the Commonwealth Department of Housing in time for it to be debated while we are discussing the estimates provided for that Department and the most comprehensive piece of housing legislation in Australia providing for the largest governmental appropriation for housing in Australia. </para><para>This Agreement . is designed to provide money for the erection of dwellings, primarily for families of low or moderate means. It is only from Housing Commissions that persons of modest or low means in Australia can reasonably buy a house on a small deposit - between £50 and £150. All of the answers to questions are expressed in pounds, shillings and pence, so on this occasion any figures that I use will not be in dollars. It is only from Housing Commissions that persons can rent houses at a rental which is designed to cover just the capital, interest and maintenance costs. </para><para>There have been articles in economic and social journals on the incidence of poverty in Australia. One such speech was made in April last year by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Appleyard</inline> of the Australian National University on pockets of poverty in Australia. He draws on similar papers given by other persons in the social welfare or economic fields. The theme which runs through his whole speech is that the greatest burden which is encountered by people in all these pockets of poverty is the cost of housing. He lists four pockets of poverty in particular. The first is the field of persons on low incomes. Here he relies on a booklet by Miss Elaine Martin entitled " High Rents and Low Incomes " - a research project of the Brotherhood of St. Laurence in 1964. Miss Martin pointed out that families earning less than £20 a week are particularly vulnerable to poverty unless they have secured low cost, housing. Quoting from the latest statistics supplied by the Commissioner of Taxation, she said that in 1960-61 there were 181,920 taxpayers earning less than £20 a week. Of that number 68.000 had a dependent spouse and one dependent child. Another 55,000 had a dependent spouse and two dependent children. The remaining 58,000 had a dependent spouse and three or more dependent children. Miss Martin reported on the poor housing conditions of many of them and, in particular, that such persons had to suffer bad bathroom and toilet facilities, crowding and lack of privacy. </para><para>Secondly <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Appleyard</inline> refers to the poverty of age pensioners. Here he relies on a document prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L. Robb and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr, Rivett</inline> entitled " Needs Among the Old", produced in 1964 covering the Municipality of Marrickville in the electorate of the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly).</inline> They surveyed the housing conditions of typical pensioners in the Marrickville Municipality at the time. Tens of thousands of single pensioners paying rent are in dire circumstances. In 1964 1,200,000 persons in Australia were receiving pensions. Many were wholly dependent on their pensions. Those who had the supplementary allowance would be dependent on 10s. more than the amount of the pension. In addition, the means test has not been relaxed for 14 years. </para><para>The third pocket of poverty which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Appleyard</inline> reports on is that of widows. Here he relies on a booklet by Miss Jean Aitken-Swan entitled " Widows in Australia ", produced in .1 962 by the Council of Social Services of New South Wales. Miss Aitken-Swan reported that many widows are forced to work, to the detriment of their homes and families. They are unable to support themselves on the widow's pension. If they obtain any amount of meaningful work they disqualify themselves for the widow's pension. Miss Aitken-Swan found that one third of the non-working widows in her survey had incomes so low that after paying for rent and a low cost diet they had less than 10s. a head for every other item of expenditure. </para><para>The fourth and concluding pocket of poverty which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Appleyard</inline> mentioned was that among part Aborigines. He found that they are generally on low incomes and that they have poor employment prospects. They lack the incentive and opportunity to get better housing. Left to their own bad housing and sanitation, they become socially unacceptable. Through all the four pockets which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Appleyard</inline> reported, there runs the common problem of housing, lt is therefore important, we believe, that the Commonwealth should recognise its responsibility to provide housing for those in greatest need and, through rebates, ensure that it is within their capacity. in my amendment 1 have referred to the interest rate. The average cost of a Housing Commission house, derived by dividing the number of houses completed by the Housing Commissions into the sum of money allocated to them, is £6,500. We know from the annual reports of the War Service Homes Division that the cost of a house and land to persons who secure finance from the Division has more than doubled in the last 15 years. The effect of our amendment would be to reduce by half of 1 per cent, the rate of interest which the States must pay to the Commonwealth, making it equal to the rate paid by persons obtaining advances for a war service home. On a loan of £6.000, repayable over 30 years, a reduction in the interest rate of half of 1 per cent, would mean a monthly saving of £1 16s. 2d. and a saving over 30 years of £651. If the loan were being repaid over 45 years the monthly saving would be £2 0s. 6d. and the total saving £1,094. One can imagine what the saving would be if interest rates were reduced to the level of the 1945 Agreement. Total repayments for Housing Commission houses would be a couple of thousand pounds less and the weekly repayments would be some pounds 'ess. This is the consequence of interest rates. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- This matter ought to be divorced from the question of the long term bond rate. We have always taken the attitude that persons receiving advances from the War Service Homes Division should pay the same interest that they have paid for the last 20 years. There has not been nor should there be any increase. We believe that at this length of time after the war the persons who are catered for by the Housing Commissions- the persons of low or moderate means - are just as much deserving of public assistance as are the persons who receive assistance from the War Service Homes Division. Furthermore the people to whom I have referred - the persons who receive the basic wage, those who live wholly or partly on pensions, widows and part Aborigines - require assistance from this Parliament just as much as do the persons who served 20 years or more ago in the Services. Servicemen who have served overseas since the war also benefit from the War Service Homes Act and they are being assisted under this Agreement while they are in the Services. </para>

                    </continue><para>I have quoted the interest rate to show the benefit there would be to such persons just by reducing the interest rate by the <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent, involved in the amendment. </para><para>In the 1945 Agreement there was provision for rental rebates. If the income of families occupying Housing Commission houses was less than five times the amount required to pay back the capital, interest and maintenance, then the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments between them agreed to make up the difference. These rebates apply now only in respect of houses which were occupied before the end of June 1956. A year ago 6,850 persons received these rebates which cost the Governments £618,605. The only people who can now secure rebates are those who secure the tenancy of houses which were already occupied before the end of June 1956. No other postwar houses are available to persons in these pockets of poverty to which 1 have referred except those occupied before the end of June 1956 and which become vacant. </para><para>People can secure Housing Commission houses now only if they can pay the full amount required to meet capital repayment, interest and maintenance if they are to be tenants or if they can meet repayments for the whole cost of the capital and interest if they are to be purchasers. Accordingly no houses are being built in Australia today which are available to the people of low and moderate, indeed extremely meagre, means. The demand for Housing Commission houses has increased over the last five years - the five years during which the 1956 Agreement was extended for another period. During that period the State </para><para class="block">Housing Commissions report that their waiting lists increased from about 70,000 to 75,000. </para><para>I have dealt with the plight of those persons who have to rely on the Housing Commissions - the persons of low and moderate means for whom commission houses are built for rental or for purchase. I have dealt with the diminishing opportunities, despite the diversion of funds under the Agreement, for persons who rely on the building societies, which are building fewer houses than they used to build. Housing Commissions, too, are providing fewer houses than they used to provide. The Minister stated that his colleague in the other place, whom he represents, is continuing to give consideration to the needs of aged persons for adequate minimum housing on reasonable rentals and to the problems that arise from rehousing those living under slum conditions. These are two matters which the Slate housing Ministers have raised for many years past. Nobody can suggest that the State Governments have funds sufficient to carry out slum clearance work or to build houses for pensioners and for aged or disabled persons, but the Commonwealth Government could provide the funds for them. </para><para>It is true that such housing would cost governments more money than Housing Commission houses cost at the moment. Fewer houses would be provided with the annual allocations and statistics would look worse than they do. If houses are built now for pensioners the pensioners will be unable to pay sufficient rent to pay back the capital and the interest over the 53 years that the Commonwealth loan funds cover. Whatever the interest rate, pensioners would be unable to pay a rent sufficient to pay back the capital sums. It is impossible now for citizens, except those in affluent circumstances, to meet the repayments which would be required on houses built in slum clearance projects. In a slum clearance project the greatest cost is not the cost of the house but the cost of resumption, compensation, demolition and clearing, lt is impossible, except for affluent persons, to meet the cost of such proposals. Accordingly in every country - in North America and Western Europe - national governments are assisting with the housing of retired and superannuated persons and with slum clearance. This is so in the federal systems of West Germany and the United States of </para><para class="block">America just as much as it is in any of the unitary systems and in Canada, lt is possible for the Commonwealth Government, just as it is possible for the federal governments in the United States, Canada and West Germany, to make grants to State governments, provincial governments or Lander authorities. It requires national resources to resume and clear the centres of the big industrial cities. Thereafter, through ordinary means, State, municipal or Lander authorities, or the various insurance companies and banks, can proceed. </para><para>The concluding subject of my amendment concerns new suburbs. As I have said before in these debates, we rely almost entirely on private enterprise to develop new housing suburbs. Inevitably, private enterprise will charge what the market will bear. In no other country, in North America or Western Europe, is this so. In all those countries now governments share the responsibility, ft is as inevitable that governments should share the responsibility for land development as it is that they should accept the responsibility for housing finance. The Commonwealth, through its banking and insurance powers, through this Bill and through the other bills that I have mentioned, regulates 90 per cent, of the money that is found for housing in Australia. It provides most of the money for communications in Australia. Accordingly, this Parliament can determine the conditions in the new suburbs, the ex-urban areas. This is a responsibility that is accepted by every national government, let me repeat, in North America and Western Europe. It is accepted by the federal governments, particularly in the United States. The United States Housing and Home Finance Agency is being renamed to accent the urban responsibilities that the Federal Administration there accepts. </para><para>This Agreement is, as I commenced by saying, a great disappointment to members of the Australian Labour Party, who, for two years, have urged that in this Agreement more enlightened, comprehensive and contemporary housing responsibilities should be accepted by the Commonwealth, which provides or regulates 90 per cent, of the money that is found for housing in Australia. The Commonwealth must care how this money is spent. It ought to see that it is possible - no other authority can make it possible - for persons of low or moderate means to secure housing. We ought to see that the areas that have degenerated as housing areas are re-created. We ought to see that the new housing areas are equipped with all the civic amenities, that they are as convenient and as beautiful as any other housing areas in Australia are. Whether this is in our metropolises or in decentralised areas, the Commonwealth, through its powers, principally over finance, for communications and housing, has the major responsibility to decide how and <inline font-style="italic">where</inline> people will live. This Agreement demonstrates that for another five years the Commonwealth will fall down on that responsibility. The Government's thinking has not moved beyond the stage it reached in 1956. The policies of three successive Administrations in the United States - those of Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson - show how much, can be done even in a federal system with its constitutional difficulties, to ensure that people live economically, aesthetically and comfortably anywhere in the country. </para></speech>

                        <para>. -I do not want to take too much time this morning, because I am quite sure that all honorable members want to get away. However, I would like to treat with some of the principles of the Bill, because it is one of our periodic five year changes to the original legislation. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam),</inline> who always speaks for the Opposition on this subject, regaled us again today with almost the same speech as he has made during the last three or four years. I do not think there is need to take him to task for the whole of his speech. The theme of his speech is identical with the course his Party followed when it was in power. We can, in effect, refer back to the original Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement of 1945 if we want to see the principles in which the Opposition believes. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I think I should refer to one or two statements that he made. He tried to impress on the House that only the Housing Commissions in Australia can sell on a low deposit or provide a house on an economic rental basis. This is, of course, completely false. Legislation introduced by the Government only a short time ago provided for advances of up to 95 per cent., leaving a deposit of only 5 per cent. I know in the practical sense that throughout Australia many organisations are selling houses on deposits of £100, with the balance on favorable conditions. So it is quite false to say that only Housing Commissions can provide houses on low deposits and it is wrong to give this impression. </para>
                    <para>I am sure that the Government could not possibly agree with the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to analyse the amendment. The first part gives no consideration to building societies; it seeks to provide more and more money for bigger and bigger Housing Commissions. In other words, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants the whole of the activities from a governmental point of view to be entrusted to Housing Commissions, which will build for sale and for rental. This is his thesis. He is not very much concerned about whether the building societies are provided with money for their operations. If he only looks past the tip of his nose he will realise that the same amount of money provided to the building societies will produce at least 20 per cent, more houses than if it were provided to Housing Commissions. The figures are available to anyone who wishes to see them. If the Government provides a certain sum of money to building societies, the money provided by the purchasers is added to it. The figures show that the net cost to the Government for the provision of homes by Housing Commissions is considerably less if the money is provided to the building societies rather than to the housing commission. </para>
                    <para>The other matters dealt with by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the amendment are quite ridiculous. He spoke of the subsidy that was granted under the original Act. He knows full well that the original Act provided for a subsidy and that the interest rate was the same as the long term bond rate. That was the original Agreement which was brought in by the Labour Party. The interest was at the long term bond rate. This Government has seen fit to reduce that rate of interest to a rate which is 1 per cent, below the long term bond rate. This provides revenue for the States to use as they wish as a subsidy. I think it must be agreed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, fundamentally, in these matters we cannot interfere too much with the principle of housing by the States. We must allow them to carry out what is their function. </para>
                    <para>It would be interesting to go back to the original history of the Agreement. I do not believe that many honorable members have the Agreement or, if they have it, that they have even bothered to read it. I refer to the 1945 Agreement which was assented to on 11th October of that year, lt is quite true to say that the Agreement arose because the Labour Party, which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition now represents in this debate, failed in its attempt to set up a Commonwealth-wide housing commission. This is why we have the present Agreement. The Labour Party in 1944 and 1945 attempted to set up a Commonwealth housing commission to take complete control of the operations of building and the provision of houses for the people of Australia on a completely socialist basis. In a debate in this place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman,</inline> the Minister at that time, was challenged in relation to this attempt and he said in reply that his Government - a Labour Government - did not want to build a nation of little capitalists. That Agreement provided for rental only. The same thought is still in the minds of members of the Labour Party. They do not want home owners; they want only a renting community. I shall read, because otherwise it may be challenged, the preamble to the 1945 Agreement which stated - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Whereas at Conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers held during the months of August, 1944, and August, 1945, proposals were agreed upon relating to the carrying out of rental housing projects by the States. . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The whole Agreement was based upon rental housing. There was no intention to give people the right to own their own homes. </para>
                    <para>Even running through the speech made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning is the thought that he is not very concerned about the big principle of giving an opportunity to families to own their own homes. He is concerned only with rental projects. This is where we join issue and where the Government is diametrically opposed to the policies and prin ciples of the Labour Party. Under the 1945 Act it will be seen that although a State was able to build a house and sell it, the whole of the proceeds of the sale had to be paid back to the Commonwealth at once. The State would not retain any of that money and there was, therefore, no inducement to the State to sell. The whole scheme was on a rental basis. The present Government was bound hand and foot by this obnoxious and horrible 1945 Agreement which would have completely destroyed in Australia the ambition of young people to own their homes. This ambition would have been destroyed completely had Labour been returned in 1949. </para>
                    <para>So the Government was bound by that Agreement in 1950 when it came into office because there had been, in that year, a renewal of the Agreement after its first five years of operation. The Government was bound until 1956 to carry out the terms of the 1945 Agreement. </para>

Then in 1958, which was the earliest possible date at which the Government could rectify this dreadful mess that the Labour Party had created, a complete change of policy and principle was made. 1 had much to do with this change at the time. It was agreed then that 20 per cent, of the money provided to the States under the new Agreement would go to the building societies for home ownership for a period of two years and that after that two years 30 per cent, of the money provided would go to the building societies for the remaining three years of the Agreement. That provision for 30 per cent, still exists and is being paid to the building societies throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>Because of the provision of this 30 per cent, of the money provided under the Agreement we have inspired the creation of the building society movement right throughout Australia whereas previously it was of any consequence only in New South Wales and to a smaller extent in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- It is; it is staggering. If honorable members will look at some of the figures in relation to housing and make some comparisons they will see that in the four years after the Second World War when Labour was in power 145,000 houses were built. That represented a rate of only 36,000 houses each year throughout the whole of Australia. This was Labour's performance in housing - about one house for every 4.5 people increase in population. This Government came to power in 1950 and, since then, has built well over one million houses in Australia. This figure is a year or two old and the number may be greater than that. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes, more than a million. It has built an average of more than 80.000 houses each year. In other words, one house for every 2.6 people increase in the population, including immigration. This Government has the greatest record in housing. In less than 16 years it has erected about 40 per cent. - this is a staggering record - of the total stock of houses that have been erected in Australia's 170 years of history. In that period more than $6,000 million has been spent on housing. </para>

                    <para class="block">Speaker, this Government is to provide $240 million for housing. The change in policy, under which the savings banks will now be able to invest more in housing, will make available from that source a further sum of about $140 million. Another interesting thing may be noted in the field of war service homes. In the 15 years of which I speak, the present Government has spent approximately $800 million on war service homes. This represents more than 90 per cent, of all the money spent on war service homes since 1919. This Government has provided more than 180,000 homes for ex-servicemen in 15 years compared with 54,541 provided by all governments in 30 years. If these figures do not constitute a compelling commendation of the record of this Government, I do not know what interpretation can be placed on them. </para>
                    <para>I hope that the Agreement that is the subject of this Bill will carry on the established principle which has existed in the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement since 1956 and which the Menzies Government put into effect. I agree that this principle must be carried on, but I would prefer a big change in the manner in which the provision of housing by State housing authorities is administered. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition a little earlier gave certain figures concerning the needs of people who depend on rental housing. The only really big problem in housing in Australia today arises in the provision of rental housing for indigent people - those who are unable to pay economic rents. An associated problem, of course, is the provision of the finance that is required more and more as time goes on to encourage home ownership in various fields of housing. But the major problem, as I have said, arises in the provision of rental housing by government authorities. I agree that in this field there should be some assistance, either State or Federal, in certain instances, and that kind of assistance is given at present. But in my opinion the State housing authorities should confine their activities to the provision of rental housing for what I describe as the indigent section of the community. I do not believe that those authorities have any place in the field of the construction of houses for sale in the normal way. I do not unnecessarily criticise the architects and builders responsible for the construction of government built dwellings. </para>
                    <para class="block">But one has only to travel about Australia and look at such dwellings to see they all have the imprint of government housing. </para>

It is the source of the ideals and standards to which we all try to adhere. I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> that we should approach housing from this standpoint and, in relation to the allocation of funds to the State housing authorities for the provision of homes for indigent people, make arrangements separate from those for the provision of home ownership finance through the building societies. 1 believe that if there were an entirely separate scheme for home ownership finance the building societies would receive much more than 30 per cent, of the allocated funds as provided for under the terms of the Agreement.

                            <para>- He is looking at me anxiously in order to get me to conclude my speech, but I shall not do so until I have made one more point. If I may say so, I am very disappointed at the way in which some State Governments, including Liberal Governments, are administering housing. I am deeply disappointed at their approach. I cannot for the life of me understand why they continue to perpetuate legislation that does not help in the provision of housing for those who need it. I cannot understand why you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> I and all the rest of the taxpayers should have to put our hands in our pockets to subsidise housing for people who have no need for subsidised housing. It is true that a tenant who goes into a subsidised Housing Commission home may need a house badly at the time. But many Housing Commission dwellings are now 20 years old and thousands of tenants in such homes are well able to pay economic rents. The occupancy of Housing Commission units by these people is only preventing the occupation of those units by indigent people who need the assistance that the State housing authorities can give. The States are not living up to their obligations in this matter. That is the respect in which I criticise them. I believe that if subsidised houses are to be provided for indigent people, a means test should be applied to government housing. </para>

                    <para>I believe it is wrong for the State Governments to continue to allow the occupation of government homes by people who are well able to go out into the open housing market and pay an economic rent. Throughout all the States today, tens of thousands of people who should not be entitled to the benefit of subsidies paid out of the taxes contributed by all the taxpayers, including you and me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> are receiving that benefit. This situation represents a weakness in the administration of housing by the States. I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> if this anomaly were adjusted and if those States in which rent controls still exist were to allow complete freedom for the charging of economic rentals, there would be no shortage of houses in Australia and very few indigent people would be unable to get satisfactory subsidised accommodation. So we are, in a sense, creating our own problems. This is happening because, in some instances, the States unfortunately are making housing a political plaything. This is a scandal that should not be allowed to continue, for housing is too important to the people for such a situation to prevail any longer. </para>
                    <para>I agree that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement must continue. However, as I have said, I would prefer to see it changed so that there would be a separate scheme for the allocation of funds to the States for the provision of homes for indigent people. 1 do not want to interfere in any way with the provision of funds for that purpose. But I believe that finance for home ownership should be entirely separate. I would like to say much more on this subject, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, but,</inline> in deference to the  Deputy  Government Whip, who has one eye on me and one on the clock, I shall leave the matter there. I conclude by saying that I hope that the States will carefully check the circumstances of people who occupy houses that arc subsidised by the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this Bill is to ratify the execution by the Commonwealth of a new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement providing for the allocation of funds under prescribed conditions for five years after 1st July next. This is the fourth Agreement of this kind, the others having been entered into in 1945, 1956 and 1961. The first Agreement was initiated by the Chifley Labour Government. We will not be advantaged by reminiscing about the past, but 1 regret, as does the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam),</inline> that the latest Agreement does not include provision for some of the most idealistic, forward looking and humane concepts which were embraced by the first Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Foremost amongst these deficiencies is the provision for rental rebates. There is not much need for me to enunciate the purpose of rental rebates. I think that everyone in this House, and the people at large, clearly understand that it was the Labour Government's intention to make assistance available to the States so that people who did not have the financial capacity or resources to pay a deposit on a house, or even pay the economic rental for a house, might be accommodated. </para>
                    <para>If the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stokes)</inline> wants to provoke me to answering the lengthy interjections he is making, then let him say so and I shall be very happy to oblige him; but I am trying to co-operate with the Government Whip by keeping my remarks as brief as possible. </para>
                    <para>The amount paid by the Commonwealth Government in 1964-65 for rental rebates under the 1945 Agreement amounted to $552,000. Obviously the States have to carry a great burden. Many of them are not continuing with this rebate system, except in respect of houses that come under the provisions of the 1945 Agreement. Tn four of the States - New South Wales, Queens land, Victoria and Western Australia - rebates totalling £618,000 were paid in the year 1964-65. These rebates were paid with respect to 6,850 tenants. Those figures give some indication of the importance of this work. If the provisions of the 1945 Agreement had been continued, many needy people would have been assisted to rent, and indeed purchase, homes. That is the first important omission from the new Agreement. </para>
                    <para>The second omission is special assistance for slum clearance. I suppose most honorable members are aware that slums persist in most of our capital cities. The various State Ministers for Housing have pleaded with this Government over the years, at special conferences, for special assistance to eliminate the scourge of underprivileged housing in the inner city areas. In 1964, the conference of State Ministers for Housing carried this resolution - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That continuous representations be made to the Commonwealth for a money grant to the States with which to acquire slum properties and clear areas for slum development; the finance to be  a  grant and not a loan. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Resolutions of this kind have been supported by Liberal Party leaders in a number of States. In Sydney, where 74 acres of the worst slums were cleared by the State Labour Government, the resumption costs averaged £60,000 an acre, as against something like £1,000 an acre in the outer city areas. It will be appreciated, therefore, that special assistance is needed for this purpose; but no such provision is made in the historic five year Agreement which is the subject of the legislation now before the House. </para>
                    <para>The third matter I want to mention is the fact that no special assistance is to be given for homes for aged persons. Most honorable members will concede that this is a problem which justifies the urgent attention of the Government. The previous Minister for Housing, now the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury),</inline> indicated without any ambiguity that the situation was serious when, in answer to a question that was asked of him on 19th May 1965, he stated that in New South Wales alone 6,676 aged persons were seeking special accommodation from the Housing Commission in that State. In Victoria, the number was 2,731; in Western Australia it was 420, and in Tasmania 115. Apparently the other States did not have figures available for that year. But the fact is that there were 9,942 aged persons who had applied unsuccessfully to the various State housing authorities. </para>
                    <para>Of course, there could be many more in need of accommodation because it has to be appreciated that elderly persons are discouraged from even applying for assistance. They come to my office in Sutherland, where I conduct my interviews, just as they must go to the offices of other honorable members, and ask whether they have any prospect of receiving accommodation from the State housing authority. I say to them: " Yes, if you fill in an application you will probably be entitled to an aged person's home in five or six years time ". The position varies from State to State, but how many more applicants would there be if these people had reasonable expectations? I should like to deal more fully with the omission of special provision for aged persons but, unfortunately, time will not permit this. Suffice it to say that, as evidence of the infertile imagination of members of the Government collectively, we have the fact that, 21 years after the original Agreement was put into operation, not one skerrick of enlightenment can be found in this 1966 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement which is to be the backbone of the Australian housing programme until 1971. </para>
                    <para>Are there no new ideas among the Government members to overcome the many serious housing problems prevailing throughout Australia? Is the Holt Government as bereft and bankrupt of ideas as this new five year housing Agreement suggests? Let me illustrate the cause of my disillusionment and my disappointment by giving a brief summary of the few unimportant and infinitesimal innovations provided for in this legislation. The variations between the new Agreement and the preceding Agreement are but minor. Honorable members may judge for themselves how important they are after I have explained them. A thorough search through the Bill and the Minister's second reading speech revealed these to be the only additions: Firstly, the definition of " Members of the Forces " is extended to include certain members of the forces on special service in South Vietnam and Malaysia. They will now be able to get assistance under the provisions of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. I admit that it is important for them to have houses, but only a handful of people are involved. Let me emphasise at once that we do not quibble about this addition, but it is not by any means a world shattering innovation. </para>
                    <para>I see the honorable member for Malice <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> sitting there like a hawk waiting to warp, twist and distort anything that I may say in a hurry today as a result of my preparedness to co-operate in the Government's efforts to shorten this debate. But I do not intend to leave myself open to his ruthless exploitation. If the honorable member for Mallee can be encouraged to behave himself for a brief time, 1 shall deal with the second departure from the previous Agreement. This relates to the removal of the provision restricting the erection of flats exceeding three stories in height outside the metropolitan area. No-one would regard that as important although some would think it a pity that this provision has been removed. </para>
                    <para>The third innovation relates to Service dwellings. The Agreement will now provide that special features may be included in the houses built by the State housing authorities for serving members of the forces. These include such things as storage space, flyscreens, blinds and linoleum, which the serviceman cannot be expected to provide for himself because of the transient nature of his employment in that he may be transferred from camp to camp. The fourth innovation relates to the provision of homes in rural areas. This is important. We have always considered it necessary to make funds available for homes in rural areas; but it must be appreciated that the building societies are to have their allocations cut by10 per cent, so that these homes can be provided in rural areas. </para>

                            <para>-I could have saved five minutes of my time if the honorable member for Maribyrnong had been a little more reasonable. This is the situation. This is the sum total, the aggregation of all the enlightenment gained so many years after the first Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement was introduced. This Government can do no better. It rejected the Opposition's proposal made last year and earlier this year that an all party committee should be appointed to investigate all aspects of housing, with particular attention to rental rebates, to slum clearance, the provision of homes for aged persons, to land development and town planning principles. There are so many things that could have been looked at so that a decent agreement might have resulted and might have been the subject of this debate today. Such an all party committee of inquiry would have given regard to the need for the forward acquisition of sites and capital advances to the States so that they could buy sites before they became expensive as a result of replanning and redesignntion. It could have had regard to environmental factors associated with housing projects such as the availability of parking space, community centre sites, parks, playing fields, and things of this kind involved in town planning considerations, together with the relationship of transport and employment and shopping complexes for every housing settlement.It could have had regard to the effect of interest rates and to project development finance. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>What we do in this Parliament is to take a great interest in ensuring that money is available at a reasonable rate of interest. </para>
                    <para class="block">All honorable members on this side of the House admit that the rate of interest is still too high. But having made comparatively cheap money available, we do not seem to have regard to the fact that in many cases it is used to buy a dear product. That is to say, too many people building houses on a large scale secure their finance from sources other than, say, the Development Bank. They often have to get money at 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, interest. When the War Service Homes Division and other housing authorities are financing homes, they find that the cheap money provided from Government sources and as a result of Government legislation is simply being transferred over in order to buy a dear product. Not only is the house purchased with dear money but so are all the services such as the provision of roads and the whole subdivision process. </para>
                    <para>SoI make the point that so much more could be said about housing today which so obviously should have been the subject of careful consideration. There are many other matters which could be considered. The availability and the cost of land should have been looked at; also the bona fides of builders and whether or not they are qualified to build. If the Government is to make money available to the States then it should ensure that the people who are building these houses are competent and that the houses that are constructed will stand the test of time. The uniformity of building codes could have been encouraged. There could have been an examination of building techniques. There could have been an examination of the need to encourage pre- fabrication of housing in Australia, as is done to some extent. The honorable member for Maribyrnong will admit that prefabrication is used in Victoria, to a fairly successful degree. We could have had a look at the potentials of high density housing. We could have examined fees associated with housing, such as transfer fees, duties on real estate, and other such things which add up to a great deal of expense on a collective basis and which cause delay. These things could have been carefully examined. </para>
                    <para>There have been firm proposals from such eminent persons in the housing field as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hall</inline> that the Commonwealth would do well under a Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to indemnify those States which eliminate the costly processes of stamp duty and transfer fees. We are told that if this were done houses would not be unoccupied for so long; that this would reduce this waiting time before you move into a house by 5 per cent. As a result, an additional 30,000 homes would become available in Australia at any given time. There are so many other things which could be considered. 1 am skimming through them in this superficial way. They should have been the subject of a careful examination. instead, they are objects of indifference to this lazy and inept administration. I think of the Building Research Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation - that great organisation - and the need to encourage research by project builders and manufacturers of building materials. There are many other things of this kind which I will not have the opportunity to elaborate upon. </para>
                    <para>At the present time there are 62,586 people waiting for State housing authority homes throughout Australia. There are many others waiting for homes under other headings; there are about 6,000 waiting for loans from the War Service Homes Division; there are about 15,000 migrants in migrant camps. There is an obvious need for urgent action to be taken. This is not an impressive record for this Government which is slavishly copying the worst parts of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. </para>
                    <para>My colleague, the honorable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Connor)</inline> had intended to speak on this subject today. I share part of the Wollongong area with him. A recent survey produced for the visiting Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline> indicated that in that area alone there are 290 people living in camping areas, 1,650 living in temporary dwellings such as garages, workshops and the like, 12,500 people occupying overcrowded or substandard dwellings and 1,300 in migrant hostels. That makes a total of 15,740 in Wollongong alone. Situations of that kind can be pointed to in many parts of Australia. I do not know how much extra time I have in which to speak because of the interruptions. I suppose I have about five minutes. </para>
                    <para>Let me also indicate that there is some concern about the building society movement. One of the things that happened to the Labour concept of the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement was that 30 per cent, of the funds made available were diverted by this Government into building societies. The Opposition does not regret that or resent building societies being given adequate funds, but we believe that there is another way of going about it. I say that because when you take funds from the State housing authorities they are being deprived of the money they need to build houses for low income earners in the community. We regard it as a very desirable thing, when going about this problem, to encourage the insurance companies to maintain the rate of lending which they had undertaken previously, if not to increase it. Let me say that the building society people are tremendously concerned with the spasmodic support given to them by this Government. The  President  of the Association of Co-operative Building Societies of New South Wales Ltd. said in his last report - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Over the past 15 years the rise and fall in funds to Building Societies has been extreme. In 1951 we held £12 million - in 1956 it was £6.6 million and last year £18.5 million. </para>
                        <para>We maintain that this fluctuation is reprehensible and shows a lack of awareness of a National duty to the small income-earner by some Banks and Insurance Companies. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Without going into the figures, it can be established without doubt that the insurance companies abandoned the obligation and the responsibility which they had when this Government diverted some of the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement funds to building societies. It is particularly interesting to note that, in all, building societies received from insurance companies only £2.4 million in a period of three years. Over the last ten years societies have received £110 million in loan moneys but only £6 million from 24 insurance companies. Yet these same companies insured £77 million worth of business. In ten years 59 insurance companies made no loans to building societies at all. Yet these same companies handled £33 million of repeating business. The insurance companies are more content to invest their money in cattle stations, companies such as H. G. Palmer (Consolidated) Ltd. and hire ppurchase organisations. This Government has allowed them to do it and the Opposition expresses concern about it. </para>
                    <para>I had intended to talk about a number of other matters but I believe that I have had a fair crack of the whip in view of the shortage of time. I conclude by expressing very sincere regret that this Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement does not have regard for the housing needs of the Australian people. Let me say that the Opposition has a very firm intention to do something dramatic to overcome the housing problem that prevails in this country. We plan to emulate the war service homes concept for all Australians. There is no reason why the low interest rates obtaining in respect of war service homes cannot be extended to all; indeed, our policy is to do this. We will raise the limit on a loan for a war service home to £5,000 and extend the purposes for which supplementary loans can be made available at <inline font-style="italic">3i</inline> per cent.

                        <para>.- One thing that the debate this morning has done is to highlight the different political philosophies of the Government and Opposition parties. I point out to the honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> that, as the honorable member for Benelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Cramer)</inline> so well put it, one of the big barriers to housing indigent people is the rental rebate scheme. What happens under the scheme is that the rental a tenant pays is based on the actual earnings of the male breadwinner in the home. A tenant may pay a rental of £3-odd a week. Then his wife, his son and daughter go to work and there is, perhaps, at least £70 or £80 a week coming into that house, but he still pays only the original rental. If a periodic financial check were made each year, as is done in the case of social service recipients, these people would pay an economic rent and we would find that the rebate system would in many cases fall by the way and be applied only to actually indigent people. This matter is in the hands of the State Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As we know housing is a State responsibility. All that the Commonwealth is doing now is an aftermath of the system of uniform taxation. The Australian Loan Council fixes an overall amount to be borrowed in the ensuing financial year and each State sets the amount it requires for housing purposes. The total of the amount fixed by the respective States forms the Commonwealth's part of the Government's loan raisings and as such is made available to the States. Let us get this clear. These loans are amortised over 53 years, and the interest rate charged now is 1 per cent. less than the long term bond rate at the time the advances are made. We have seen a great deal of change from the original Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement made by the Chifley Government in 1945 to the Agreement that is being extended today. The original Agreement was one which had as its main concept, as honorable gentlemen opposite have said, the establishment of homes at low cost rentals. Wrapped up with this was a 60 per cent, subsidy for rental rebates to cover losses resulting from letting properties at uneconomic rents. This did nothing whatsoever to benefit home owners. The result was rather the reverse. It was a system, as I have shown, which has been capable of misdirection. I refer to the fact that people have obtained rebates to which they have not been entitled. </para>
                    <para>Later Agreements made provision for the sale of these former rental properties to the tenants at low deposits and over extended periods. The 1956-61 Agreement put conditions on the States over rental rebates and allowed the States to apply only concessional interest amounts for rental rebates. </para>
                    <para class="block">It has been said that four States already do this. Other changes from the 1945 concept were in respect of land development, the sale of homes and the allocation of portion of the loan funds to provide finance for the private home builder. When the measure providing funds for the private home builder was introduced in 1956 the amount agreed upon by the States was 20 per cent. It was subsequently increased to not less than 30 per cent. Also a separate allocation of 5 per cent, for military housing was made. </para>
                    <para>There is no doubt that low rental housing will always be required, but it is plain that over the past 15 years there has been a definite trend away from this concept and the demand for housing assistance has yielded to the demand for private ownership. This has been reflected in the changes which have taken place in the reenactments of the Agreement from quinquennium to quinquennium. Originally the Commonwealth did not do a great deal in the housing field. Its interest was restricted until 1945 virtually to the provision of war service homes finance. Then came the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Later we had the Aged Persons Homes Act, and in 1964 we saw the creation of a Federal housing authority. With this came the introduction of the homes savings grants and housing loans insurance legislation. Then again the Commonwealth further intruded and made direct loans under the Loan (Housing) Act introduced last year of Si 5 million. In all the Commonwealth will have provided by the year 1965-66 more than S240 million for housing purposes. That is a pretty fair intrusion by the Commonwealth into the housing field. These changes which have been made suggest to mc that pressure is being applied for some breakaway between the public sector and the private sector. I believe that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in its present form does not fill the bill. Honorable members on both sides have said this, and I say it again. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to learn that there has been set up in the Department of Housing a Bureau of Research. It is hoped that that Bureau will be able to complete a survey on which a demographic analysis can be made of our housing requirements. Further, the Secretary of the Department is leaving for overseas to obtain firsthand information about how other countries overcome their housing difficulties so that we can do something about our housing problems in the future. I suggest that one of the first steps must be to remove from the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement the provision of loan funds for the private sector and include in any new Act only those funds for which State Governments have a responsibility, restricted perhaps to slum clearance, erection of low rental housing and land development. There is no direct relationship as from State to State firstly in the total amounts which they apply for to the Australian Loan Council for what they consider their housing needs are and secondly, in the proportion within this amount which each State allocates to the Home Builders Account. The only restriction is the provision that not less than 30 per cent, must be paid to the Home Builders Account and most Governments as a matter of policy will bolster up the public sector and not give one whit more than 30 per cent. </para>
                    <para>I do not think the private sector should have to be worried by conflicting State policies and State interests. I believe the private sector should be financed directly by the Commonwealth Government, and in this connection I refer particularly to the Commonwealth decision to allow an extra $15 million to be raised by way of loans for housing purposes. This was an extra amount provided for housing in addition to the loan funds provided in the usual way under this Agreement. It was channelled into the economy per medium of the Agreement. It was the Government's intention in making the grant to provide a quick stimulus to the economy per medium of the building industry. The purpose could have been achieved much more effectively if the money had been channelled directly into the private sector. What happened was that the bulk of the money - at least 70 per cent, of it, except in Queensland where the proportion was 60 per cent. - went into the public sector, and public spending is bottle-necked by regulations. The public authorities have projects pending while they wait for further funds, so that money provided in this way does not get into the economy as quickly as it would through the private sector in which building societies are waiting with numbers of private builders who can put the money to work for the benefit of the economy. </para>
                    <para>Direct grants are made by the Commonwealth in cases of national disaster - floods, bushfires, droughts or other such catastrophes - to the States concerned according to their needs. Surely the Commonwealth authorities should have their fingers on the pulse of the economy so that they can assess housing needs at a particular time and inject the necessary money into the economy directly, either through the public sector or the private sector, depending on where the down turn is evident. I believe that in the provision of finance, the public sector should be completely separated from the private sector. </para>
                    <para>Under the existing legislation there are many undesirable side effects. We know of the high prices paid in the inner areas of our capital cities for property on which some clearance projects are planned, and we know that in many cases this land is bought long before funds are available for its development. When the development does occur it is frequently in the form of four-storey walk-ups or multi-storey apartments in which children are denied a normal home environment. They have no backyards to which they can bring their mates. The tenants of those apartments have no gardens. These conditions induce adult laziness and juvenile delinquency. In one State the Government is actively competing with private industry in the field of land development. </para>
                    <para>There is one aspect of the housing situation which has been sadly neglected. In this connection I can speak with authority only of my own State, but 1 am sure that a similar situation exists in other States. I believe that the provision of rail transport in developing areas is as vital as the provision of roads, electricity or other utility services. In most capital cities the sprawl of development has followed the suburban railway lines. In Melbourne, which I know better than other cities, the result has been that dead pockets have been left in areas close to the city, and these are waiting to be developed. No new railway line has been built out of Melbourne in 100 years. The last line built was that of Essendon, a distance of six miles, and that was in 1860. There have been short extensions. The last was from Darling to Glen Waverley, a distance of about four miles, which was completed in 1929-30. There has been tremendous development over the whole 26 miles of the Melbourne to Frankston railway, but the areas to the north east and north west of Melbourne have been completely neglected. Templestowe, Doncaster, Bulleen in the north east and Keilor. Tullamarine, Airport West, Niddrie, Avondale Heights in the north west - all those places have been neglected. </para>
                    <para>The Essendon line that I spoke of was built in 1868 and was extended a further six miles or. so to Broadmeadows in 1872, but a large area of land within eight to twelve miles of the centre of Melbourne has not been properly developed and broad acres of it are awaiting development simply because there is no rail transport available. The recent plans to provide a rail link with the new Melbourne airport at Tullamarine have apparently been dropped by the State Government. 1 have introduced this matter because I feel that the provision of rail facilities is as much a part of the housing problem as slum clearance. This is a State matter and 1 suggest it is another reason why the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement should not cover both the public and private sectors. There are far more difficult matters to be attended to by the State Governments in the public sector than those that have to be attended to with funds provided directly for private housing. We should disassociate all Commonwealth assistance for private housing, whether by loan funds or direct grant, or through this kind of Agreement, from assistance given in the public field. Future agreements of this kind should be restricted to Government spending, both civil and military. Funds for slum clearance, land development, the provision of public transport by rail or other means, and of other utility services, as well as financial assistance in the private sector, should be considered by the Federal housing authority with due regard to the needs of each State. The money should be provided through the Home Builders' Account or by some other suitable method. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately we find ourselves committed to the extension of this Housing </para>
                    <para class="block">Agreement for a further five years, with some minor amendments. I shall not comment on those. They have been mentioned in the second reading speech and, in the interests of expediency, I will not go over them except to say that I am not altogether happy about the removal from ministerial control of the restrictions that were previously placed in building flats of more than three storeys above ground level in areas other than inner city areas. This could lead ultimately to the development of slums in country areas. An industry might start up in a country centre and be followed by the provision of housing of a kind not normally provided in such a place. </para>
                    <para>I can only hope that within the five years covered by this Agreement, the Commonwealth Government will have completed its demographic survey of housing needs, so that it can decide the best way to provide assistance both in the public and private sectors. 1 hope it will make this decision long before the expiry of the Agreement so that we can introduce something that will really work and which will have a scientific basis. The amendment proposed by the Opposition again demonstrates the Socialist attitude of honorable members opposite. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that houses could be obtained much more cheaply in other parts of the world.He overlooked the fact that 74 per cent. - I think that is the figure - of homes in Australia are either owned or being purchased by private individuals. No other country can match that record. The amendment shows the weight which the Opposition places on this subject of homes for rental. I point out again that when proper periodic checks are taken of the financial position of people living in rented Housing Commission homes we will see a change in the attitude of State housing authorities with regard to rental rebates. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not have sufficient time to deal with all aspects of the Bill, but I should like to refer to a few points that have not been mentioned by other speakers in the debate. The honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> referred to one Roman. I do not think we can emulate another Roman - Pontius Pilate - and say that we are prepared to hand over the money and leave everything to the States. For this reason I regret that the Government has brought the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement before the House without following the suggestion made in an amendment moved on 3 1st March this year that a nation wide inquiry be held into housing needs before any fresh agreement was entered into. This is not the opinion only of the Labour Party; people associated with the housing industry have put forward this point of view. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Perhaps it is a coincidence, but this week at Surfer's Paradise, the Housing Industry Association has been holding a conference on housing needs. It may not be a bad idea to state some of the points of view that have been put forward by members of the Association. The Association was formed recently because of the instability of the housing industry, brought about by a series of booms and bursts. The irregular flow of finance in the industry - it was not as regular as the tides - led to irregular employment, which has had a disastrous effect on the industry and has contributed in no small measure to rising costs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. K.</inline> J. Driscoll, Queensland  President  of the Association, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The most unsettling factor in forecasting whether loan money will be available is the variation in funds allocated for housing loans. Not one of the major lending authorities can say definitely how much, if any, finance they will have available for the next three months, six months or a year. For example, Federal Government allocations for housing are channelled through the States into building societies, but it is not known through which societies funds will become available until actual allocations are made. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I am sure that many honorable members have received protests from building societies, many of which use their allocations in the first six to eight months of the year. Contractors normally employed by the building societies have to look elsewhere for work. In many cases, tradesmen are lost. When finance becomes available again there is a mad rush to employ tradesmen, who in many cases must be enticed away from the employment that they have obtained during the temporary recession. This situation is having an effect on the training of apprentices in the industry. Contractors are tending not to employ apprentices and a regular number of tradesmen but rather to let contracts for the supply of labour only. This practice is frowned upon by building unions because of its disastrous effect. Many employers are adopting this practice in order to dodge their responsibility to train apprentices. </para>
                    <para>The major problem in housing today is lack of finance, particularly cheap finance. Our amendment proposes that the interest rate on loans made from money raised under the Agreement should be reduced to the level of the rate charged under the War Service Homes Act. lt is all very well to say that you can buy a home on a low deposit. No-one would know better than honorable members associated with the selling of homes, such as the honorable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Irwin),</inline> who has had wide experience in this field as a bank manager, that it is not so much the deposit that worries prospective home owners as the repayments and the interest rate. </para>
                    <para>One of the depressing features associated with home ownership has been the increase in recent years in the cost of land. There may be some connection between this increase and the £250 home savings grant introduced by this Government recently. It is significant that since the introduction of the scheme, land prices have risen by as much as or sometimes more than the maximum grant. This situation has been brought to my attention by the practical booklet published quarterly on the housing industry, lt is interesting to note that although 30 per cent, of the money provided under this Agreement will be made available to building societies, there is no guarantee that they will lend home seekers up to 95 per cent, of the cost of the home - the amount guaranteed by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. I think building societies are rather like most banks. They would rather have 20 satisfied customers each getting 95 per cent, of the total value of their homes and 10 dissatisfied customers getting 60 per cent, or 75 per cent., than 30 partly satisfied customers all getting somewhat less than 95 per cent. </para>
                    <para>How times have changed as far as the deposit on a home is concerned is pointed out by the Queensland Secretary of the Housing Industry Association, who said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>But while the maximum loan available from the main lending bodies is $7,000, the most popular choice in Australia is a three-bedroom house in brick veneer which costs $8,000 to build. </para>
                        <para>Take an average price of $3,700 for the land and $8,000 for the house to make a total of $11,700. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Australian Labour Party believes that times have changed. We believe that it is time to increase the maximum loan available from building authorities. The Commonwealth should give the <inline font-style="italic">lead, particularly</inline> in respect of war service homes, where it could increase the maximum loan to $10,000. The Queensland Secretary of the Housing Industry Association pointed out that, taking into account other incidental costs associated with the building of a home, a prospective home owner would have to find 45 per cent, of the total cost before he would be able to set about owning a home. So much for those who are able to purchase a home. There are other members of the community who for various reasons would never have the opportunity of owning a home of their own. Many of the reasons were mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The situation of such people is well known to ail honorable members. They will never be able to purchase a home, so they have to live in a rented home. There are people who, possibly because of injuries sustained in an accident, have suffered a decrease in income and are unable to meet their weekly rentals. There are others equally worthy of consideration who could be assisted by way of rental rebate. It is true that rental rebates apply in certain States and I understand that one means of financing a rental rebate scheme is by increasing rents to other tenants of Housing Commission houses. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Queensland Government has, by allocating a minimum of the Commonwealth money to the Home Builders Account, and by finding the balance from loan resources and from high interest debenture loan raisings, deprived home building societies of finance to the extent of $12 million during its nine years of office. While I am pleased with the allocation for rural home building I believe it will have some serious effect on Queensland's allocation to building societies. For this reason the Labour Party has moved that the Commonwealth advance be increased by the amount to be allocated to home building societies. We feel that housing is of such importance to family life that housing loan remissions of SI 00 to $200 for each child should be granted to assist those in need of help.

                        <para>.- This Bill authorises the continuance for five years, commencing 1st July next, of the arrangement under the 1956-61 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement whereby the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the States for housing purposes by way of funds advanced at concessional interest rates. That Agreement has been amended in minor respects on occasions. From time to time there is criticism of this Government's allocation of funds. The Agreement does not define the amount of the allocation. The money to be made available for housing is the responsibility of each State. After a general survey of the financial resources the Loan Council determines an overall limit to the borrowing programme for the ensuing financial year. Each State nominates the amount it requires for housing and these amounts become part of the Commonwealth's share of governmental loan raisings for the year and are made available by the Commonwealth to the States under the Housing Agreement. I trust that what I have said will clear up the misapprehension that exists about the Commonwealth's role in respect of housing allocations, lt will be seen that the amount used for housing purposes is determined by the States. The better the management of State affairs the more money a State can apply to essential needs like housing and education. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Chifley Government's Housing Agreement of 1945 placed practically its entire emphasis on rental housing. In recognition of the fact that many families of low and moderate means desire to own their own homes, Liberal-Country Party Administrations entered into Housing Agreements whereby the States could sell, on liberal terms, dwellings constructed under the Agreements, and also eased the harsh terms applicable to the purchase of dwellings built under the 1945 Agreement. The Agreements entered into by the Liberal-Country Party Administrations were freely negotiated with the States and were the result of deliberations by Housing Ministers and housing officers of the Commonwealth and the States. The proposal to continue advances on practically identical conditions met with a generally favourable reaction from State Housing Ministers. </para>
                    <para>Under the Chifley Agreement of 1945 the Commonwealth meets 60 per cent, of the losses incurred by a State in the administration of dwellings erected under the Agreement. A major factor in such losses is rental rebates, but to obtain the benefit of the 60 per cent, contribution a State is obliged to comply with a number of conditions so stringent that only two States have been able to meet them in recent years. The 1956- 1961 Agreement, therefore, left it for the States to decide whether the concessional interest rate would be used to provide rental rebates. Some States do, in fact, use the concession for this purpose. </para>
                    <para>Clause 6 provides that loan funds advanced to a State shall be divided into two parts. At least 30 per cent. - it was 20 per cent, in 1956-57 and 1957-58 - is to be used to provide finance for private home builders by means of loans to building societies and other approved institutions. Clause 16 provides for the money to be distributed through a Home Builders' Account. The remainder of the money is advanced to State housing authorities. It is expected that in the 10 years ending on 30th June 1966 the total amount of loan funds advanced to the States for housing will be $866,822,000, of which $267,881,400 will have been allocated to the Home Builders' Account. The total then made available from the Account, however, will be about $307 million because of the accumulation of surplus funds in it. The Commonwealth also allocates funds for housing in other ways than through the Agreement. It makes tax free grants to young couples, amounting to more than $7 million in the first half of 1965-66; subsidises homes for the aged and infirm; provides housing and finance in the Territories under its control; provides loans of about $70 million a year through the War Service Homes Division; and provides funds for the erection of dwellings for serving members of the forces. The total funds to be made available by the Commonwealth from all sources in 1965-66 is more than $240 million. </para>
                    <para>The State allocation should not be reduced by the diversion of 30 per cent, to building societies. Results of the use of moneys available to building societies and other approved institutions compare very favourably with the results that would have been achieved by the use of the money by State housing authorities. Repayment of the Commonwealth advances is made over a period of 53 years, but the institutions have been required to repay loans from the Home Builders' Account over periods not exceeding 31 years. This permits most advantageous use to be made of the housing moneys. As repayments by the institutions exceed the amounts required for repayment of the allocations to the Account, the excess is available for relending to institutions. The actuarial computation is that funds allocated from the Home Builders' Account will be employed about twice over the 53 year amortisation period of the Commonwealth and State loans. The institutions require larger deposits than the housing authorities require from purchasers. This means that greater savings per house are effected in the case of the Home Builders' Account, with the result that more houses will be financed by building societies with a given sum than if that sum were made available to the State housing authorities for building houses either for rental or for sale on low deposit by the States. </para>
                    <para>The combined effects of the revolving fund operation of the Home Builders' Account and the provision, of larger deposits on loans by building societies over the nine year term of the 1956 and 1961 Agreements up to 30th June 1965 is shown in the following table - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Under the 1945 Agreement, homes in the main are built for people on low incomes and for indigent people. But what is the position in New South Wales? Members of Government boards and parliamentarians live in Housing Commission homes. If pride and shame do not make these people vacate the Housing Commission homes, the State Government should take action against them. I had an unfortunate experience about August of last year. I tried to get a home for a widow, who is about 23 years of age and who has six children. </para>
                    <para class="block">She is an excellent person and had not committed any offence against society by gambling or by wasting her money. I went to the Housing Commission and implored it to give this woman a home, but I was told that no provision was made for such people. After four months of determined effort, I obtained a home for her. She and her six children were living on a verandah measuring 20 feet by 6 feet. Unfortunately, one child died before I could procure a home for her. This is an eternal disgrace to those of us who are at least normal Christians. The point I make is that affluent people, people who were well off when they went into Housing Commission homes, members of State boards and parliamentarians are living in Housing Commission homes to the exclusion of such people as the widow 1 have just mentioned. That is why I am sorry that this Agreement was not placed before us before the State and Commonwealth Ministers decided on the terms of it. I think both sides of the House deplore the situation that I have just outlined. We would not have allowed the Agreement to have continued while affluent people occupied Housing Commission homes to the detriment of low wage earners and indigent people. </para>

                        <para>. - There seems to have been a certain amount of misunderstanding as to the extent of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and the ground that it covers. This is typified by the remarks of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hansen),</inline> who said that we should impose or consider various conditions before handing over Commonwealth money to the State. This is not, in essence, anything of the kind. This is a subsidy of 1 per cent, on the moneys that the States borrow under the Financial Agreement and they are loan funds accruing to the States. We subsidise by 1 per cent, the amount that the States allocate for housing purposes. Reference is also made to what happens in the different States. But of course the total amounts applied are decided by the States when determining their loan programmes. The whole of the moneys, which are really State moneys, cover only one-fifth, roughly, of the housing operations in Australia. So it would be quite inappropriate to tack on to an agreement of this kind conditions relating to all housing activities throughout the community. There is a very limited amount that this Agreement will carry. It will continue to finance the basic activities of the Housing Commissions and the terminating and permanent building societies. These bodies are all in operation. They require to be kept going and the Agreement will enable this process to continue. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> raised, amongst other things, the question of some of this money going to building societies and suggested it should all go to the Housing Commissions. He deplored the fluctuation in the supply of money to building societies. With this, of course, we can all agree. But the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement provides a rock 'bottom stability for the operations of building societies. The amount provided under the Agreement varies very little from year to year and it provides a good continuing basis, whatever the fluctuations in the funds available to them from other sources. </para>
                    <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline> continued to talk about the planning of suburbs and how we should lay out our future housing requirements and so forth. We all have our views on this subject and in many respects, of course, most enlightened people would agree in broad, general terms with this idea. There are such things as the planning bodies in New South Wales. The Victorian Government also is extensively interested in planning, and the position is similar in other places. These are essentially State matters. They certainly have nothing to do with the finance provided under this interest subsidy scheme. If we as a Commonwealth were to go to the States and say: " We will give you this 1 per cent, interest below bond rate and in return you will submit to our ideas on how you should plan your cities, where you should put everything, and everything should be subject to Commonwealth control", they would tell us to forget all about the Agreement. They would say: " We will provide our Housing Commissions with funds from our ordinary loan moneys ". This proposition just does not ride. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> talked about things with which everyone could agree in nice rosy general terms. He spoke of the desire for exploration of industrial building methods, improved prefabricated houses such as Victoria is evolving, uniformity of building codes in which much work is being done currently, stamp duties and transfer fees. These things, it has been suggested, should be tagged on to the Agreement and brought into the debate, but these are matters controlled by the States. Ti we tried to inject these features into an agreement of this kind the States would pull out. It would make no sense at all. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition mentioned an annual report to the Parliament. I understand that the Opposition intends to move an amendment at the Committee stage so I shall not deal with this matter now. However, I do deplore the fact that this Agreement, which covers a very limited field, is made the supposed vehicle for all kinds of other ideas which anyone might have with the implication that these things could reasonably be injected into the Agreement and still keep it in existence. </para>

                    <para class="block">The essence of the amendment is that we seek to require the Secretary of the Department of Housing to present to the Minister a report on the operation of this Agreement for subsequent presentation to both Houses of the Parliament. The amendment provides also that the report should be provided next year. It should be mentioned that, in another place, the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> said -  1 am not completely unreceptive of this idea of an annual report. I believe that the Parliament should be kept fully informed on these important matters and I agree in principle with the amendment for that reason. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Opposition wants to have this matter dealt with because there has been tremendous difficulty encountered in gathering the reports of the six State housing authorities over the years. </para>
                    <para>It is known by many honorable members that there is a considerable lag involved in the production of some of these reports. I should mention also that under other legislation concerned with housing reports are made available. I refer to the War Service Homes Act, the Homes Savings Grant Act and the Housing Loans Insurance Act. I believe the exclusions are the Aged Persons Homes Act and the Disabled Persons Accommodation Act. It could well be that, although no reports are required under the last two mentioned Acts, this deficiency might be overcome in the same manner as the Opposition proposes that the deficiency in the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement should be overcome. I propose the amendment because I know that a report would be not only of tremendous benefit to members of both Houses of Parliament but also of great interest to people right throughout the community who have an active involvement in the housing problems confronting the people of this country. It would result in improved documentation because the officers of the State housing authorities do play such a tremendous part in the provision of houses in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government cannot accept this amendment. Although I say that one could sympathise with the views expressed and the desire of the honorable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. L. R. Johnson)</inline> and others to obtain more detailed information on the operations of the State housing commissions in readily available form by a certain date, we do not think that the report within the Commonwealth compass could be very fruitful. All that the Commonwealth could do would be merely to report the amounts of money that had gone to the various States and very minor matters which had occurred between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to this matter. The information which is sought and which honorable members seek from time to time about the activities of State housing commissions, particularly by putting questions on the notice paper, is sought by the Department of Housing, but it has to be provided by the States. To what extent they will provide information and the nature of the information which will be provided is up to the States themselves. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There is a further complication that I can see. As the honorable member for Hughes would know, the housing commissions in each State are not by any means financed wholly under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, particularly in South Australia and Queensland, but also in other States. The States do inject a considerable volume of funds of their own into their housing activities. If we did accept this amendment we feel that the information which we could guarantee to provide would be too limited to be of any value. In any case this matter comes up each year in the House when legislation related to this Agreement is debated. The Commonwealth in this and other matters is not in a position to pry into State finances. The report suggested in the amendment could be effective only if the provision of all the information in the form required by the Commonwealth was made a condition of the Agreement. This has not been made a condition previously and it is a proposal which the States might reject. Each State through its housing commission operates in a rather different way. There are different conditions of tenancies, for example. </para>
                    <para>Information is made available by the States eventually in their own reports, but this is not a requirement which we could impose on the States. We are indebted to them for the amount of information they do supply. I have discussed this question with the Minister and she is prepared, as and when the opportunity arises, to discuss with the State Ministers whether it would be reasonable to compile all this information in each State and put it together in one document. Consequently, the Government cannot accept this amendment, not because it is hostile to the idea but because it is not really practicable for it to do so prior to discussing the matter with the States. </para>

                            I wish briefly to discuss the Government's decision not to proceed today with the debate on the Queensland Beef Cattle Roads Agreement Bill 1966. This decision represents a monstrous miscarriage of justice. The prime reason for the Government's action is to avoid the acute criticism and embarrassment that must fall on both the Federal and the Queensland Governments if the measure were discussed. This action is all the more ominous because it  is  clear that the Government does not want this Bill debated before the Queensland State election. The Government's action in refusing to allow this Bill to be debated is almost unbelievable when the facts are fully known. Firstly, despite the complete absence of any allocation of beef road funds in the last Budget, the Government was able to announce suddenly, on the eve of the Dawson by-election, the provision of an extra $4 million for beef roads in Queensland. This blatant vote catching action received considerable adverse publicity throughout Australia and was even condemned in editorials of responsible newspapers. The excuse given by the Government was that this was an urgent priority allocation to help Queensland with a continuity programme. Last week, the Minister for National Development
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline>
                            introduced legislation into this House  to  authorise the allocation by the Commonwealth of $4 million, as announced in the Dawson by-election campaign, for the construction of priority roads in Queensland. Until today it was the intention of  the  Government to have this Bill debated before the Parliament went into recess. Now, for reasons known only to the Government, it has been withdrawn from debate in this sessional period.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The comprehensive analysis of road requirements throughout northern Australia, under a $200 million road programme, recently carried out by the Northern Division of the Department of National Development, revealed that of the hundreds of roads considered, seven roads were so urgently required for the cattle industry that they warranted immediate construction. Six of these roads were located in Queensland and one in the Northern Territory. All these roads have been included in the northern beef road programme except one - the Nebo-Mackay road, lt can easily be shown that this road is far more important to the cattle industry and to the economy of the country than many of the roads on which Commonwealth funds are now being expended. The reason why the Government will not have the Queensland Beef Cattle Roads Agreement Bill debated before the Queensland election is that it will have to reveal that one of the most important beef roads in Australia - the Nebo to Mackay road - has been completely omitted from the road programme. As the Minister for National Development has stated that the road programme has been drawn up after discussions with the Queensland authorities responsible for roads, the full blame for the omission of this vital development road must be shared by the Queensland authorities and the Federal Government. </para>
                    <para>The seriousness of the omission of this very important road is illustrated by the undisputed fact that Mackay is the only port, and the only coastal town in Australia with an export meat works, that does not possess a road to its hinterland. As those concerned with the cattle industry know, an effective road to the hinterland cattle country is essential for the efficient operation of a coastal meat works. No-one in the Commonwealth sphere would dispute the importance of the Nebo to Mackay road, but apparently the road authorities in Queensland do not believe it is important or that it should be constructed as a beef road with Commonwealth funds. It is perhaps of significance that the Queensland Minister for Main Roads resides in this district. The debate on the Bill would also have brought out the fact that very serious miscalculations were made in the costs of construction of certain Queensland roads and that within three years the original estimate of $18 million had been increased to $27 million. </para>
                    <para>As a consequence some roads which are now being constructed with Commonwealth funds would have had, in effect, a much lower priority if the true costs of construction had been originally known. </para>
                    <para>The other important point which would have been forcefully brought out is the method of financing these roads, now being adopted by the Commonwealth. The explanation given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> in support of this new method is very close to deliberate fabrication. The Treasurer stated that the new beef roads would be financed by the State on the same terms as have applied in the recent years of the current beef roads scheme - half by grant and half by fully repayable interest bearing loan. The facts are that at no stage during the whole of the current beef roads programme was this method of finance ever agreed to by the State Government or, in fact, ever mentioned. The $16.6 million already committed was made up of grants of $10 million for the construction of roads to gravel standards, and $6.6 million in loan funds for sealing. This was the accepted method of finance between the Commonwealth and the State. It is in line with the grants paid to Western Australia for beef roads, and in accordance with the method of financing beef roads under the 1949 States Grants (Encouragement of Meat Production) Act. </para>
                    <para>As beef roads are essentially development roads in undeveloped areas of northern Australia, it is completely unjust for the Commonwealth to introduce this new method of financing for beef roads. At the same time it is most difficult to believe that a responsible State Government would agree to such conditions which, in turn, impose extra hardships on local authorities and people living in the northern areas of Queensland. </para>

I also sent an urgent telegram to the Prime Minister on 4th May, and still I have received no reply to my question. This matter was first raised by me on 9th December 1965. What I had to say then is recorded on page 3893 of " Hansard " of that date. On that occasion I said - 1 understand that they- that is, national service trainees, or conscripts - were asked to sign a document that embodied three propositions. 1 am not sure that I have the exact words, but 1 shall outline them as best I can. The first proposition was to the effect that (a) they should not disclose that they were going to Vietnam and (b) they should not disclose the timetable for their departure. The second proposition stated that they would be given pre-embarkation leave provided they pledged that they would return to their unit before the ship sailed. The third proposition  is the great mystery. It was a statement that they agree to serve overseas. 1 know of instances in which young conscripts have refused to sign this document and have been subjected to intimidation tactics. Pressure has been brought to bear on them. </para><para class="block">As I have said, that statement was made on 9th December last year.

I notified him that I intended to raise the matter during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House today. I said that I did not expect the Prime Minister to come in to answer me but I hoped that he would send in one of his Service Ministers to provide an answer. </para><para>All I want to know is whether national service trainees are being requested to sign a document which includes a proposal that they are prepared to volunteer for service overseas.

                        MALCOLM FRASER (WannonMinister for the Army} [1.2]. - There is no Government or Army Headquarters requirement for any national serviceman to sign any document saying that he is willing, or that he would like, to serve overseas. Honorable members should know that it is established quite clearly in legislation that has been passed by this House that national servicemen must be prepared to serve wherever the security of Australia demands and wherever the units to which they have been posted as individuals may be deployed in our own interests or to meet our own international obligations. However, to try and meet the wishes of individual national servicemen, some units in different commands did prepare, of their own volition, questionnaires asking national servicemen, after they had done their infantry training, which corps training they would prefer. For example, some might prefer infantry corps training while others might prefer to go into one of the other Army corps. We try to meet the wishes of individual servicemen in this regard as far as possible.
                    </para><para>When asking this question as to the type of service the national servicemen preferred, some of the units also asked whether they had had any preference as to where they would like to serve. Reference was made in one or two of these questions to service overseas. Because of the misunderstanding to which a question of this kind is open, and because there is a clear requirement from the Government and from the Parliament that all members of the armed forces shall serve wherever Australia's security demands, questions relating to areas in which they may or may not wish to serve will not be asked in future. But the Army will still do what it can to meet the wishes of individual national servicemen with respect to the corps training they would prefer to undertake. It was entirely a unit decision to ask this question, the motive being an endeavour to meet the wishes of individual servicemen as far as possible. There is no point in this. I have said what the position is. I have said that there has never been a government or an Army headquarters requirement for this. The law as it is spelt out is perfectly plain. Honorable members know that national servicemen are integrated with the Regular Army; that they must be so integrated if we are to meet the commitments before us and to answer the demands that must necessarily be met in relation to our own security. </para><interjection>

                        <para>From time to time since 1961 there have been informal discussions in the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General concerning the possibility of State legislation complementing the Trade Practices Act 1965. The question whether there is to be complementary State legislation is one for the States themselves. By letters dated 4th April 1966, the Prime Minister asked each State Premier whether his Government proposed to enact complementary legislation. The Government of Tasmania has since advised that it intends to introduce appropriate State legislation. The form of the legislation will be determined by the Tasmanian Government after cortain legal difficulties, which are at present under consideration, have been resolved. The Governments of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia have said that, at this stage, they do not propose to introduce legislation, and the Government of New South Wales has advised that the question is currently under close examination. The Government of South Australia has not yet replied to the Prime Minister's letter. There is to be further discussion of the matter at a meeting of the standing committee on 21st and 22nd July 1966. </para>

                        <para>The provision of National Television Stations is being carried out in accordance wilh a plan agreed upon by the Government some years ago when arrangements were concluded for the extension of National Television service to country areas. Whilst these arrangements did not visualise a strict order of priority as between the various Stations proposed, the plan did recognise the need to proceed with the overall project simultaneously in all States. The difficulties associated with the provision of roads and power to some mountaintop sites and the time required for the provision of long microwave relay systems for the transmission of programmes from the capital cities were determining factors regarding completion dates in some cases. </para>
                        <para>The time table for the completion of the remaining high-powered national television stations is now as follows: - By  30  June  1966-  Southern Downs (Warwick), Queensland. </para>
                        <para>Albany, Western Australia. Griffith, New South Wales. By  30  September  1966-  Cooma/Bega, New South Wales. Dubbo, New South Wales. Cairns, Queensland. (This will be a lowpowered temporary installation pending the building of an access road to the permanent site.) Late  1967 -  Mackay, Queensland. </para>
                        <para>The delay in establishing this station is a direct result of conditions imposed on the Department by the National Park Authorities who control the site. A tourist quality road is to be provided to enable the area to be developed as a tourist attraction. It is expected from current progress that the project will be completed in about 18 months. </para>

                            <para>From time to time throughout the year the Board advertises in the " Gazette " and in Public Notices with the objective of continuously recruiting Third Division Clerks of the highest possible quality. Applicants, whether school leavers or officers of the Fourth Division, are required to have achieved a minimum education level and, if otherwise eligible, are thereafter selected for appointment or transfer on the basis of open competition. For this purpose the applicants arc ranked in order of merit by means of the Commonwealth Selection Test introduced upon the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Service Recruitment (The Boyer Committee). In any particular period, those applicants low in the order of merit may not be appointed or transferred either because the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of available vacancies or because of better quality applicants becoming available. </para>

The Boyer Committee's recommendation was that selection for entry to the Third Division should be openly competitive as between outside candidates with the Leaving Certificate and candidates eligible for transfer from the Fourth Division. However, Fourth Division officers have the advantage that they are eligible for transfer until they reach retiring age whereas those seeking appointment from outside the Service must be under 28 years of age. </para>

                            <para>I have previously explained in answer to a question on notice that it would not be appropriate to divulge publicly in detail the extent and sources of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation's business: the Corporation is a commercial undertaking operating in a competitive field, lt can be said, however, that many lending institutions are making high-ratio loans in all States. The monthly volume of insurance proposals received by the Corporation has risen to more than $1 million and the total value of loans insured now exceeds $3.5 million. In assessing this achievement, it should be noted that, although the Corporation formally opened for business on 26th November 1965, it did not become effectively operational until normal real estate activity resumed after the Christmas holiday season. </para>

Since the establishment of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the Commonwealth Saving Rank has made insured loans, in appropriate cases, up to 90 per cent, of the bank's valuation of a properly with a maximum loan limit of $7,000. In almost all of such cases, the purchase price and the bank's valuation were the same. </para>

It was my understanding that these facts had subsequently been given publicity. I find on enquiry that they had not. However, both the Minister for Trade and Industry and my colleague, the Minister  for  External Affairs, have since furnished information about and explained the Government's attitude in relation to this question - " Hansard ", page 1204, 27th April 1966, and page 1357, 28th April 1966. The situation is, as my colleagues indicated, that Australian trade with North Vietnam had in fact ceased. </para>

                            <para> In 1960 the Government agreed to a proposal from the Executive Heads of F.A.O. and U.N.I .C.E.F. that a joint public appeal for funds be held in Australia, the proceeds to be divided equally between U.N.I.C.E.F. and the F.A.O. Fredom from Hunger Campaign. The appeal was to be held in 1961, but was conducted mainly in 1962-63 and 1963-64. Having regard to the Commonwealth sponsorship of this appeal, it was agreed that donations made to the Australian National Committee of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign up to 30th June 1963 should be allowed as deductions for income tax purposes, and section 78 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act was amended accordingly. When the appeal was not completed by 30th June 1963, the Government agreed to extend the concession to donations made up to 30th June 1964, and the Act was further amended to give effect to this decision. Commonwealth patronage was considered to be at an end when the joint appeal was completed in 1963-64. </para>

            <para>The committee organising the appeal was subsequently reconstituted as  a  purely private body. The appeals it has organised in that capacity are private appeals. Representations to have the taxation concession extended to gifts made to appeals conducted by the new appeal committee after 30th June 1964 were considered by my predecessor who decided against granting the extension. Representations along similar lines have recently been made to me by the committee. The Government recognises that international aid financed by private appeals can be of value in promoting international relationships. It docs not follow, however, that private appeals of this nature should, as  a  matter of course, be assisted financially by the Government especially at  a  time when the Government is already making very large and growing amounts available for international aid. In these circumstances, I have reiterated to the committee the advice given by my predecessor that deductions for income tax purposes will not be allowed in respect of donations to the appeal currently being conducted. </para>

                        <para>The Australian Government has repeatedly made clear its firm view that the treatment of prisoners of war should always conform to the dictates of humanity and the principles embodied in the various international conventions on this subject, and has informed the Government of the Republic of Vietnam of its attitude. For its part, the Government of the Republic of Vietnam has confirmed its willingness to observe the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners and to co-operate with the International Commission of the Red Cross to this end. It has also issued specific instructions to its forces enjoining humane action towards prisoners and adherence to the spirit of the Geneva Conventions.

By way of illustration it has been estimated that during the year ended 31st December, 1965, more than 800 physically handicapped persons were accepted for permanent appointmnt as contributors to the Provident Account. </para>

                        <para>Subsequent to the United Nations Sugar Conference held in Geneva in September and October last year, discussions have been proceeding within the International Sugar Council and elsewhere with the objective of setting the stage for an early resumption of negotiations for a new International Sugar Agreement. A Consultative Committee comprising representatives of the leading sugar exporting and importing countries has been established by the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to try to reconcile differences of views and advance negotiations to the stage where the calling of a further Conference would be warranted. The first meeting of this Committee was held in March and a further meeting has been convened for 16th May. Australia is a member of the Committee, lt will only be possible in the light of the outcome of meetings such as these to judge whether a  resumption  of the negotiations would be warranted in 1966. </para>

                        <para>No. As I indicated in reply to a question without notice from the honorable member for Mackellar on 27th April last, no proposals have been advanced at the Australian Transport Advisory Council suggesting that the left-hand rule of the road should be changed. In the circumstances, there are at present no immediate reasons for undertaking an examination of the costs and nature of the alterations to Australian roads that would be involved in such a change. In any case, these costs constitute only part of the overall costs of a change - there would be additional costs in respect of motor vehicles as well as traffic signals and road signs and markings. </para>
                        <para>The Bureau's primary commitment at this stage is in surveying the overall Australian road situation. This survey may well provide information in respect of some of the problems in the context of roads which would arise in changing the rule of the road. </para>

                        <para>The Government has for some time past been considering the possibility of further double tax agreements with other countries, including Japan. In the case of Japan, preliminary talks have taken place at the official level with the Japanese, and the Japanese authorities have indicated that they would like to proceed to formal negotiations. However, it may be that negotiations of any further double tax agreements will need to await re-negotiation of our agreement with the United Kingdom which will be necessary in view of recent changes in the British taxation system, particularly the introduction there of the Corporation Tax. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the question of the establishment of a branch of the Bank of Tokyo, it is longstanding Government policy not to authorise overseas banks to open branches to conduct banking business in Australia. The establishment of such branches is not considered necessary as a means of facilitating the entry of overseas capital. </para>

The proceedings were for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for alleged offences against sections 4 and 9 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1950, and for injunctions restraining the defendants from repetition or continuance of the alleged offences. The proceedings have not yet come to trial. Some delay was caused by an interlocutory application by the defendant and further delay occurred when questions that could arise in the proceedings came before the High Court in other proceedings. Those questions were decided by the High Court on 3rd March 1966, and the possible effect of the Court's decision on the proceedings is now being considered by counsel for the prosecutor. The future course of the proceedings will be decided in the light of counsel's advice. </para>

                            <para>I can assure the honorable member that the Government has, from time to time, examined closely, the possibility of introducing a voluntary dental insurance scheme to provide financial assistance towards meeting the cost of services rendered by dentists. However, there are a number of very real economic problems inherent in the operation of any such scheme and, until satisfactory solutions can be formulated, the Government has not considered it advisable to implement a dental insurance programme. </para>
                        
                    <para>An additional factor which has to be taken into account is that the question of providing Commonwealth assistance in respect of dental services must be considered in relation to the effect such a scheme would have in connection with other services, such as nursing, optometry and physiotherapy, which do not at present attract Commonwealth benefits. The honorable member will realise, I am sure, that any proposal to extend the National Health Scheme to provide Commonwealth assistance towards the cost of dental treatment must necessarily involve consideration of the desirability and practicability of covering those other ancillary services -also under the National Health Scheme. Any extension of the Scheme along these lines would naturally place an additional burden on the Australian taxpayer, and this is a further reason why the Government has decided not to increase the Commonwealth's already heavy commitments in the health field at this stage. </para>
                    <para>In the circumstances, I cannot foresee an early move towards an extension of the National Health Scheme to provide for Commonwealth benefits for dental services. </para>

                        <para>- On 21st April the honorable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Griffiths)</inline> asked me a question in reference to a statement by my colleague, the MinisterinCharge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research about the relationship of additional Commonwealth assistance for education to the constitutional responsibilities of the Commonwealth and all the States? My colleague has supplied the following outline of the remarks he made on the recent public occasion which apparently prompted the honorable member's question - "There are a number of people who urge that the Commonwealth Government should make increased grants to the States  for education '. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If this refers to an increase in general grants then the Commonwealth, even if it increased general grants, would have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> constitutional power to direct that the increase in the general grants was spent on education. We have no constitutional power to direct States as to how their general grants should be spent or as to the priorities they decide on. </para>
                    <para>The only way that the objective advocated by these people could be attained would be by the making of special grants, under section 96 of the Constitution, directed to a particular area of education and under laid down conditions. </para>
                    <para>Even then the objective of these advocates would not be attained unless one of the conditions laid down was that the level of State spending on education should not decrease and also that the annual level of increase in money spent on education because of an increasing State Budget should continue. </para>
                    <para>Either this action, or an amendment of the Constitution, would be the only way the objective of these advocates could be attained ". </para>

                    <para>I have since been informed that the sale of a steel processing complex has been negotiated, although not yet concluded, between Communist China and an international consortium including Federal German, French, British, Italian and Swiss firms. </para>
                    <para>The project consists of a warm and cold rolling mill to produce steel for the building industry, tin plate, and sheet steel for car bodies. It is estimated to cost approximately SI 55 million, the German share being about S62 million, and credit terms over a period of five years are envisaged. </para>
                    <para>It is expected that the construction of the mill will be completed in two years and processing should begin in about five years. </para>
                    <para>The mill is not among those items which Western countries have agreed should not be exported to Communist China. </para>

Both Ansett-A.N.A. and Trans-Australia Airlines have provided rum on their aircraft for trial periods extending over some months, the last occasion being by T.A.A. in 1964. However demand for rum was nol sufficient in the airlines' view, to warrant its continued carriage. </para>

                        <para>Miners' pensions schemes, covering bituminous coal miners, have been established under State legislation in all States except South Australia where no bituminous coal is mined. The Commonwealth is not in any way associated with the establishment or operation of these schemes and any initiative for modification of the schemes lies with the States. However, following representations made to me by the State Minister for Mines in the former Labour administration in New South Wales and repeated to me by the present Minister for Mines, it was agreed that a report on the structure and operation of the schemes be prepared by the  Chairman  of the Joint Coal Board. This report was completed and discussions followed between the Joint Coal Board and the States. In March last, however, the Slate Ministers concerned met but agreement was not reached on the action to be taken. If and when the States reach agreement they will presumably make an approach to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member will recall that in his original answer on 18th August 1964 my predecessor emphasised that the information being supplied by him represented the current position as obtained from Slate publications, and that only the responsible State would have complete and up-to-date details of the various measures listed. The same is true concerning the current cost of the various forms of assistance given by each State Government to non-government schools and their pupils. Neither of these matters is the responsibility of any Commonwealth Minister and consequently no responsibility can be taken for figures obtained from State publications. </para>
                        <para>The information which follows has been collected from the most recent State Budget Papers and other official reports as indicated. It is far from comprehensive because for many activities the State accounts do not distinguish between government and non-government schools or pupils. </para>

                            <para>The Department of Immigration distributes many films to its overseas posts and to migrantcarrying ships. They cover many aspects of daily living, work and leisure, of interest to prospective settlers. The films are intended to supplement, as far as is possible visually, the more detailed printed fact pamphlets on these subjects which are distributed to all prospective settlers. The films are mostly shown at specially arranged film and information evenings at which officers of the Department are present to answer questions. </para>

                            <para>The Department does not buy or sponsor the production of films aimed solely at attracting tourists. Tourist attractions are not included in films made for the Department. The representative of tourist authorities on the Australian National Film Board has been informed of this approach which applies particularly to the Department's series of 12 "Life in Australia" films, each of which deals with daily life in a capital city or country centre. The series includes  a  film on Perth and another on Geraldton. All films in the series show housing, shops, transport, hospitals, local industries and work opportunities as well as sporting, cultural and other leisure activities. A similar series of shorter 8mm films designed to be shown in window displays and exhibitions overseas also includes many of these features. This series includes films on Kalgoorlie and Bunbury.</para>

<para> The aim of films dealing with country centres is to show intending settlers that it is possible to find work and to live comfortably and happily in many places outside the cities better known to people overseas. As the films are made to be shown in many countries of Europe, as well as Britain, they feature local residents generally rather than solely migrants from specific areas. This also maintains the original concept of the films, which is to show how Australians live. Features of country towns included in the films are determined broadly by advice from the Department's posts overseas about what prospective settlers want to know and by what emigration authorities in migrant source countries suggest should be shown. State and local government authorities, the Department of Labour and National Service, Good Neighbour representatives and local residents are normally consulted on appropriate points when surveys are made of the towns as a preliminary to filming. </para>

                        <para>When on 4th May 1966, the Commonwealth Statistician released the statistics of overseas arrivals and departures for the quarter and year ended December 1965, 1 authorised my Department to make the following statement: " Although the Former Settlers Departing figure has increased in recent years, the net settler gain has been increasing at a much faster rate. </para>
                        <para>While settler departures increased from 8,500 in 1962, to 14,800 in 1965, the net settler gain (after allowing for departures) increased from 82,000 in 1962, to 132,700 in 1965. </para>
                        <para>There is a tendency in migration, arising from greater prosperity, for migrants no longer to regard their migration as irrevocable. Increasing prosperity in Europe is an important factor in this. </para>
                        <para>Good wages earned in Australia have meant that many migrants can afford to return to Europe if they wish. Greater availability of low-cost travel is also  a  contributing factor. </para>
