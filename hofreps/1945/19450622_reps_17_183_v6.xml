                    <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. Last Thursday, I made a statement which, in one respect, was misreported in the press, in that two words that I had used were not published. I accused one Thornton of being a Scotsman. I did so on the best of advice, but I have since been informed that Scotland is not responsible for him in any respect. At a meeting of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney last night, Thornton said, " Martens was wrongly informed. My father was an Englishman, and 'my mother an Irish woman ". <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Liston, the repre sentative of the Australian Workers Union on the council, retorted, " That is another injustice to Ireland ". I regret having coupled' Thornton with Scottish people in this country. For many years, I have had thousands of good friends of Scottish descent, and not all of them are my political supporters. I tender my deepest sympathy to both England and Ireland. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Acting Minister for Defence, who represents the Minister for Supply in this chamber, seen a statement in the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Weal Australian,</inline> of the 20th June, that th&lt;shortage of wharf space at Fremantle is primarily responsible for the fact thai ships are not being turned around rapidly at that port, a fact which prevents the shipment of urgently needed civilian supplies from the eastern States? Is the Minister aware that the reason given f  ot  the shortage of wharf space is that urgent ship repair work is being done at some of the wharfs used for the unloading of general cargo in peace time? If this if true, docs it not indicate that there should be established at Fremantle a fully equipped repair dock, particularly as it is the last port of call  for  ships before they face the long journey across th* Indian Ocean, and the first port of call in Australia for ships coming to this country over the same ocean? Does th, Minister know the history of naval establishments in Western Australia, with particular reference to the naval base at Rockingham, on which a very large sum of money was expended during the last war, but which was abandoned before completion? Will the Minister see that the Henderson naval base is completed a.'  rapidly as possible, or does the Government intend to repeat the mistakes of the past, and abandon the work after so much money has been expended? </para>

                        <para>- I recall the representations of the honorable member in connexion with ships going to "Western Australia in ballast when there was lying in eastern ports important cargo that was needed in Western Australia. The House will remember the answer given on that occasion; but, in spite of that answer, [ still felt it necessary to press the matter further, so that only in the most unusual circumstances should ships be allowed to travel in ballast from eastern ports to Western Australia. A great deal of wharf space at Fremantle has been taken by the naval authorities because of needs arising out of the war, and because more naval vessels are using that port now than ever before. If naval vessels are taking up wharf space formerly used for civil purposes, thus preventing the normal flow of trade, it is clear that something will have to be done to improve the position. [ commend the honorable member for the suggestions which ho has offered. I shall take the matter up with the Department of Supply and Shipping with a view to having a course of action decided upon. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the circumstances mentioned by the honorable member. I shall make inquiries in regard to the first part of the question and supply him with information on the subject. In regard to the second part of the question, I believe that a suggestion was made at an earlier stage, not hy the Government, that it would be unwise for repatriated prisoners of war to give lengthy newspaper interviews, but this suggestion related to prisoners of war who were recovered from Japanese hands. The honorable member probably knows something of that case. No such instructions have been issued by the Government in relation to prisoners of war who have returned from Europe. However, I shall inquire into the matter and supply any available information to the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I have not at  my  disposal the exact position of the coal stocks of gas and electricity undertakings. There are several causes of stocks becoming low, and one of the most important of these was the recent dispute involving deputies. I shall ask the Coal Commissioner to give me what information he can supply on the subject, and I hope to have that information before the House meets next Tuesday. I take this opportunity to express my admiration of the work done by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> in helping to secure a settlement of the dispute. Honorable members will appreciate that these matters are difficult to adjust, and the practical knowledge of the honorable member, who knows the coal-fields and the men who work there, was of great value to the Government, which is grateful for his assistance. </para>

                            <para>- The difficulties apply both to trainees and to long-service men. Their release will throw a considerable strain on the vocational training establishments in particular, and also, at a later stage, on the employment service. The honorable member will realize that these releases have yet to be co-ordinated with a general scheme for the release of at least 50,000 men by the end of this year. It is hoped that arrangements will be made for releases of key personnel for training purposes to take place almost immediately, so that, when larger numbers of men are discharged and will require vocational training and employment service, training facilities will be available for them. I cannot see how the raising of the age at which vocational training will be available, from 21 years on enlistment to a higher age, would help to solve the problem. It indeed would make the problem more difficult, because it would mean that more individuals would be applying for vocational training than now. I assure the honorable gentleman that everything possible is being done to secure at the earliest possible date the release of key personnel required for training purposes. </para>

                            <para>- Employees of the Commonwealth, of course, include ex-servicemen. The Government has an experimental station for building construction in the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, which collates all data available from overseas and such information is handed on to the State governments and other authorities interested in housing. I am certain that if we apply ourselves to the problem with energy and can obtain the full cooperation of the State governments, we shall be able to have constructed in the coming year a very large number of houses. Perhaps it will be difficult to reach the target of 24,000, but, I believe that we can reach something approaching that figure. The construction of houses by the Commonwealth is a matter of policy. So far the Commonwealth Government has realized that with the very limited supplies of men and materials available the State government instrumentalities and private enterprise can absorb the lot. To  put" a new authority into the field as a claimant for building materials would not make the task any easier. However, that matter is being kept in mind all the time and it may be that the Commonwealth will decide to enter the field as a constructing authority, so far as its powers under  the  Constitution enable it to do so. </para>

Permits for repairs made obligatory by local government authorities are issued almost automatically, although there may have been a slight delay in a few instances owing to the very large number that has to be considered.

Many workmen on the coal-fields are meeting with great difficulty in obtaining transport from their homes to their work. When a motor ear is available, it frequently transports half a dozen men to their place of employment. When men cannot obtain tyres, even for bicycles, they are in considerable difficulty. Is it possible to release more tyres and tubes? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot indicate any prospect of an easing of the restrictions. We are still in great difficulty in regard to tyres and tubes. The production of synthetic rubber has advanced considerably in Australia in the last six months, and we are now depending on it to a great degree to meet our urgent requirements. When I was administering the Department of Supply and Shipping every effort was made to meet the needs of urgent users, and I am not aware of any alteration in that respect. If the honorable member has in mind any particular locality where special difficulty is being experienced and he will give me the information, I shall cause inquiries to be made. </para>

                        <para>- I have read this challenge. I view with grave concern the licence that is associated with the publication of grossly exaggerated or totally untrue statements by some sections of the press. The practice is common in matters that concern the Government, which is not given fair treatment by some newspapers. This is a classic example. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> has stated that 60 per cent. of the personnel of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> were taken off that vessel prior to its departure for the United Kingdom. The statement that I made in this House in regard to the total number of personnel drafted from the vessel, was repeated at a meeting of the Advisory War Council in the presence  of Commodore 'Showers, second naval officer, and the drafting officer, and was verified by him. He was asked a question, which he answered satisfactorily. This newspaper, with a view to covering up its earlier declaration in regard to the matter, and to satisfy its inordinate desire for sensationalism, has stated this morning that certain naval men had challenged, the authentic and official statement that I made in this House. Honorable members will note that the newspaper has not mentioned the name of any person. I emphatically affirm that no reputable officer or rating would seek unauthorized publicity of this character. 'This morning, I checked the position with the Navy Office, and was informed that the press report is completely inaccurate. Preliminary conferences in regard, to the drafting were held at various times prior to the 5th May, on which date final arrangements were made. From then to the date of sailing - the 24th May - '23 officers and 128 ratings were drafted out of the ship. Therefore, the statement that 200 personnel were moved from the ship 48 hours before sailing is entirely incorrect. The further statement that personnel were leaving the ship up to twelve hours before sailing is in the same category. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> has a personnel of 1,000 men. Yet the newspaper has stated that up to 50 per cent, or more were drafted from it! I have given the official version, f deprecate most strongly statements which can only cause dissatisfaction and irritation to the members of one of our fighting services, are detrimental to Australia's war effort, and must have serious effects on the public mind. One is justified in asking whether such licence should not be more than merely deprecated. </para>

If you have, do you regard it as being calculated to bring the Parliament into contempt and as an example of licence rather than an exercise of the freedom of the press? It depicts an empty House, with an honorable member lying on the front Opposition bench, half asleep and arms outstretched. The Speaker's mace is not on the table. There is only one Minister on the front treasurybench, and ho appears to be asleep. Another Government member is shown with his hands to his head, and my colleague sud I are shown on the back bench ; I am depicted as having a head of hair.

                            <para>- The honorable member's question raises a very important matter, one to which <inline font-style="italic">1.</inline> have been giving serious consideration for some time. Representatives of the press are here by the courtesy of the House, and not by any right which they possess. If honorable members are satisfied at any time that a section of the press is abusing that privilege, the House can take the necessary action. I am at present considering submitting to the Government and the House proposals for something which is at present sadly lacking - that is, a properly defined rule covering the matter of privilege, so that the House would not only have the right to declare when a privilege had been breached, or contempt offered to Parliament, but also power to inflict punishment for such breaches of privilege or for such contempt. I have not seen the cartoon referred to. I am not much concerned with what is put into cartoons, but I am concerned with any attempt to belittle Parliament or to destroy its prestige. Recently, some writers in the press have gone very close to the line. I have already indicated that if they step over the line they will go out of this House and remain out while I am in the chair. </para>

                        <para>.-I support the bill. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> when discussing this and the previous banking bill, said that he did not know anything about banking. Well, for a man who knows nothing of banking he certainly gave a very fine exposition of the subject, but I resent his allegation that members of the Government and its supporters are irresponsible persons. Not long ago, the Leader of the Opposition addressed a meeting of the newly formed Liberal partyin Melbourne and, judging by the report of the meeting which appearedin the MelbourneHerald. I should say that women formed more than 50 per cent. of the audience. </para>

                    <para>-Not at all. Imerely point out that there appeared tobea predominanceofthe gentle sex at the meeting, and that the Leader of the Oppositiontook advantage of thisfact. We haveall heard the storythe lady who, when asked how she enjoyed the pictures,replied, " Theywerewonderful. Icried allthe time ". The right honorable gentleman told such a doleful tale at thismeeting in Melbourne that I am sureall the ladies had their handkerchiefs inuse beforeit wasover.As I have said, Iamvery tired oflistening to thecharge that supporters of the Government are irresponsible men. Idonotbelievethat the public would elect irresponsible persons. Nothing isgained by declaring that the Government uses Gestapo methods. There are, of course, always two sidesto every question, and there is always room for argument, but there is no need to descend toabuse. The Leader of the Opposition is awelleducated man, and he could use his powers of oratory to better purpose. Abuse is not argument. In their attack upon, the Government's banking proposal's, members of the Opposition have sought to playupon the fears of the people in just the same way as did the opponents of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, when he introduced the first Commonwealth Bank Bill. The Oppositionand others opposed to the Government's banking policy are Unanimous in describing this bill as" political ".I remember when the Fisher Government established the Commonwealth Bank. That bank was conceived, born and reared in politicalism. The Bruce-Page Government triedto place it beyond the power of this Parliamentby adding a board to the managerial structure. What else was that but political? The members of the board were no more fit to administerthe CommonwealthBank than I should be. Some of them were businessmen; so am I, but I wouldnot claim to understand financesufficiently to conduct a bank, as they did.I do, however, know some of the things that finance does. To say that becauseaman becomes amemberof the Commonwealth Bank Board he becomes a financialgenius overnight isridiculous. Honorable members opposite say that the bank will be politicallycontrolled. Of course it will. The CommonwealthGovernmentconsists of men who everythree years must face the electors. Why, the Commonwealth Parliament is themost democratic set-up in the world. It is elected to controlthedestiniesof the country, and in order todoso it must alsocontrolfinance. Abraham Lincoln said, "Government isfinanceand finance is government ". So,until the Commonwealth Bank wasestablished by the Fisher Government, this country wasruled, not by its elected representatives, but byprivate financiers. Last night the honorable member for Warringah (Mr.Spender).,expressing faith inprivate enterprise, said that it could do the job of post-war reconstructionif it were left free to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. First, the private banks, by extending credit, caused the inflationary period, and, then, when the country needed money most to rehabilitate itself, although we produced food in plenty, thousands and thousands of men and women were forced to tramp the streets fruitlessly searching for the jobs that would enable them to buy it. If that is an example of the capability of pri vate enterprise, it is high time that the Government wrested this country from such control. A friend of mine operating a particularly good business was financially sound. The general manager and the local branch manager of the private bank in South Australia went to see him. The general manager said to him, "You have a very nice place, but you should make certain alterations, and now is the time to do it. We will advance you the money to enable you to make this place what it ought to be". He accepted their offer. We all know what happened : the bubble burst, and, as is usual when something goes wrong, the local manager was changed. This business man did not do all that the general manager suggested, but he was operating on an overdraft. The new branch manager called on him and said, "I have a very unpleasant duty to perform. I want to discuss your overdraft. In fact, we want you to liquidate your overdraft because finance is very strained ". </para>

I know what your powers are. I Enow that my mortgage is at short call and that you can make me insolvent. You can do so if you like, but I will not comply with your request. The investment is secure. My assets will more than compensate for the overdraft. So <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> back to the general manager and tell him what I have told you ". Later, he went with the local manager to the city to interview the general manager, who put up the same proposition to him. He told the general manager, " You are the man that induced me to incur the expenditure. Take whatever measures you think are within your power and putme through the insolvency court. I shall tell the world what you have done ". The result was that he was one of the few whom the bank did not bluff. He is now living in retirement, but if he had not stood up to the bank he would have been in the same position now as are thousands of primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In the depression the banks made insolvent 3,000 primary producers in South Australia. Where would the primary producers be to-day if they depended on the banks? They would be in the same plight as the 3,000 men whom I have just mentioned. This measure will react to the advantage of the people generally, and will confirm public confidence in the Government. It was my business to interview men who had fallen into arrears with thebanks, and I know how badly the banks treated them. That is why I object to all the talk of rehabilitation under private enterprise. Private enterprise fell down badly on that job in the depression years, with the result that thousands of men were thrown out of employment, while farmers, although they produced more goods than ever before, could not obtain a return adequate to pay overhead expenses, and thousands of them had to leave the land. The same thing would happen after this war if this Government did not take the steps necessary to prevent a recurrence of that tragic depression. Propaganda is being circulated to scare the people. The Government's opponents are warning the thousands of small depositors in the savings banks that their savings may be lost as the result of this Government's policy. Honorable members opposite are trying to create a fear complex in the minds of workers, widows and orphans. The same old line of propaganda has been used throughout the years in an endeavour to discredit the Labour party. The people's savings will be safer under a Labour government than under any other government. This propaganda against the Government and the Parliament is wrong. The people have shown that they have faith in the Labour Government and in the Parliament. During the referendum campaign, I was asked frequently by primary producers and others whether it was necessary to pass the referendum in order to give the Government power over the Commonwealth Bank. I said, of course, that the referendum would have no effect on the Government's powers over the bank, and that at an opportune time the Government would introduce a bill to establish the Commonwealth Bank in its proper position. The referendum had nothing whatever to do with the (financial policy of the Government. The necessary powers have been available to the Commonwealth for years, but previous governments have failed to use the Commonwealth Bank for its proper purposes. In order to show that the Government's opponents are using the same propaganda as was used in 1911, when the Fisher Government established the Commonwealth Bank, I shall refer to newspaper articles published at that time. The following passage appeared in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> of the 21st November, 1911: - </para>

                        <para>Evidently the Fisher Government have come to the conclusion that the tempering process is unnecessary, or, if necessary, that it can be carried out by a government institution.

                        <para>For this relief, much thanks. It is satisfactory to learn that the trustees of the Savings Bank in this State are fully alive to the seriousness of the menace, and will deal with the matter in the interests of the depositors. The New South Wales Government also have the question under consideration. They are taking counsel's opinion as to whether the Commonwealth Government has power to establish Savings Banks, and if it should prove that the Constitution is sufficiently elastic to permit of this unexpected  development  of federal policy, they propose a joint protest from the States against the threatened interference with such vitally important State institutions. In Queensland it has been suggested that if the attempt is made to render the continuance of the State Savings Bank impossible by withdrawing the existing facilities for depositors at the post offices the State Government should make ever; school teacher and every railway stationmaster officers of the local institution. The feeling indicated by such statements is certain to grow the more the effect of the centralizing policy is realized. Australians are satisfied with the existing arrangements, and in a matter which affects their pockets they will tx&gt; especially disinclined to take the suggested leap in the dark. </para>

If it intends to reach out for these it can get them only by offering bigger advantages to the depositors than the present savings banks offer in the shape of higher interest rates. Speaking for Victoria, I may say that this Ministry will not permit the present Commonwealth Government to thus illegitimately gather up the savings of the Victorian people for expenditure in other parts of the Common wealth. We are firmly resolved on that. If necessary we intend to fight to conserve the huge interests which are in our care, just as we fought to prevent the Commonwealth from aggrandizing itself at the expense of the States in the recent referenda struggle. </para>

Such statements should be discounted now just as heavily as they were thirty-odd years ago. I have another extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> of the 1st December, 1911.

                    <para>The Chamber of Commerce resolved last night, " that the proposal of the Federal Government to establish a Commonwealth Bank is fraught with great danger, as the bank is not required in the interests of the community". An amendment "that the Commonwealth Bank is fraught with great danger to the financial status of the people of Australia and should be referred to a committee of banking and financial experts, and that a protest be made against the establishment of a Commonwealth Savings Bank ", was lost by one vote. </para>
                    <para class="block">Had the original Commonwealth Bank Bill been referred to a committee of banking experts the bank would probably never have been established. It certainly would not have been such an effective instrument in the interests of the people asit has been. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that after the banking smash of 1893, the banks met their obligations to depositors; but they did not give any consideration to the unfortunate people who had mortgaged their properties. A few days ago I met in South Australia, the son of a fanner, since deceased, who told me that his father had mortgaged his farm for £750, with one of the banks that crashed. The bank simply foreclosed on the mortgage, and the man lost everything. That is what happened to many other people who were in the clutches of those institutions in the early 'nineties. The banks that suspended payments in those days may have satisfied their depositors ultimately, but they foreclosed the mortgages of those who were unable to meet their payments. Like many other people, I had an unfortunate experience with the banks at that time. I had a property which I had mortgaged. Although only three months before the bank suspended payment, I had obtained an increase of my advance on the security of the property, I was told by the manager of the bank that I had to meet my indebtedness within seven days or they would foreclose. The value of the security had not changed in the three months, but I had to discount the mortgage in order to meet the bank. Some time afterwards when I was about to open another business, the local bankmanager came to me and said, " It would he convenient for you to bank with us ; what about it ? ". I said, " You had better approach your head office". I did not hear any more from him. Fortunately I am independent of the banks now, but that does not alter the fact that I, like many other people, suffered severely because of conservative banking practice in days gone by. I would like to read extensive extracts from a <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> article that was published on the 1st December, 1911, but because of limitation of time I shall confine myself to the following paragraph from it: - </para>

I am fortunate enough to have a little substance, but that does not alter my view that it should be a case of " all in when the country is at war. I believe_ in equality of sacrifice, not the one-sided sacrifice that is so manifest to-day.

                    <para>That proves that the Government is, and always will be, prepared to protect the savings of the workers of the Commonwealth. We cannot have any confidence in the ability of private enterprise to re-establish ex-servicemen; it will fall down on the job, as it has on other occasions. I have said before, and I repeat : " Finance is government, and government is finance". The Government should be in control of the finances of this country. There should be an internal economy. It is claimed that our economy is dependent upon the volume of our exports and the financial conditions in other parts of the world. We have had years of bountiful production of almost everything that the community requires, yet our people have almost starved. An economy which permits such a state of affairs, should 'be reformed. I contest the claim of those who, during the depression, said that Australia should <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> have an internal economy. There were men who, in those years, had their own internal economy, because they had plenty of money and wanted for nothing. Although Opposition members say that I am wrong, I repeat that if money can bc found to blow people to pieces and send them to the other world a* quickly as possible, there is something wrong if our financial resources cannot be used to ensure to our people a decent standard of living. This country cannot be populated and developed, along the old lines, which gave no credit to human values. Our people must he given economic security. When conditions were adverse, many people of the Old Country, as- well as in Australia, claimed that there must be a new order; but quite a number of them, now that the danger to our existence has passed, have forgotten their former professions of belief and are actuated solely bv the considerations of "'business as usual". </para>

                        <para>.- Government supporters have learned at least one lesson from the present war.  Curiously,  it is the lesson of hara kiri that has been taught by our Japanese enemy. This Parliament is committing hara-kiri. It could have no better instrument for self-destruction by disembowelment than the bill that we now have before us. Earlier to-day, there was a reference to the traducing of tha Parliament by persons outside these walls. It was claimed that the press and the public were libelling and slandering the members of this parliamentary institution. I am completely opposed to anything that would lower the status of the Parliament, or detract from its dignity or its historic strength. But if the Parliament is not to be traduced by the press or the public, it must itself recognize a.nd be prepared to accept its historic responsibilities. Many Government supporters entered this Parliament for the first time after the last elections, and thus have had a comparatively brief experience of its methods. I believe them to be sincere and earnest. I warn them that, by this legislation, the Executive is stealing from the Parliament much of the strength and authority that have been built up by centuries of painful struggle on the part of English-speaking people. That will be the central theme of my  remarks. This measure contains provisions which will take from the Parliament and hand to the Executive - a body over which honorable members may consider they have some control, but in practice will be able to control only very slightly after this legislation has been passed - supreme authority in relation to not only the financial structure of this country, but also the domestic life of its individual constituents. </para>

Can it be said that it rested, with the people at any of these times? Of course it cannot.

                    <para>Before analysing some of the provisions of the bill, which, to me, have a. special significance, I shall deal with amatter that was raised last night by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> I attach more importance to it than I customarily do to statements by that honorable gentleman, because it is typical of the appeal that is made by frothy demagogues with a view to misleading the people of this country as to what is financially practicable at any given time. He spoke of the condition of perpetual debt in which we now find ourselves. I suppose that that cry has been raised from the day of the first national debt in Great Britain. Actually - I should have been glad to have the official figures; I placed a question upon notice with a view to obtaining them - the interest bill of the Commonwealth, despite the enormous increase of the national debt during the war years, is not very much greater now than it was immediately prior to the war, because of progressive reductions of the interest rate. However, I shall not attack the Minister's argument on that ground. In countries that have a national debt, there is the backing of the assets produced by government expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Even war debts are accompanied by some residual, utilitarian assets. We shall have in this country after the war, as the result of Government expenditure, roads, hospitals, ports, harbour facilities and a variety of other assets, as well as greater industrial strength, far more trained artisans, and perhaps a better disciplinary spirit throughout the community because of the lessons taught by the war. I do not, of course, claim that more than a small fraction of war expenditure is of productive value: quite obviously, the bulk of it is incurred for purposes of destruction. I return to the specious plea that was dealt with very effectively by my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies,</inline> merely because it was broached in rather a different way by the Minister for Transport almost immediately afterwards. My leader analysed the claim that, in times of peace, the vast sums provided for purposes of destruction during a war period can be provided for purposes of production and development. In a sense, that may be true. I give to honorable members a domestic analogy, which may appeal to them as coming within their own experience. In the life of a family there may come a time when some crisis develops, necessitating a mustering of resources. Perhaps some member has to undergo a serious operation, or a heavy financial loss is sustained, or a death, or succession of deaths, has occurred. In such circumstances, the savings accumulated over many years may have to be expended to meet the crisis. Family assets, even the furnishings of the home, may have to be sold in order to carry the family through a desperate period. Nobody could reasonably say that the family, now thread-bare and without assets, could continue the same rate of expenditure indefinitely. In the same way, in a time of national crisis, the Government is compelled to bring into the pool the savings of the people, and all the national resources, and expend them extravagantly. However, let no one delude himself that the country, having got through the crisis, is in the same strong position as regards national assets as it was before. </para>

                            <para>- Last night, the Minister for Transport said that the national debt should be pegged, and that henceforth Government expenditure should take the form of the disbursement of interest-free money issued by the Government itself. Imagine what that would involve. After the war, there will be a big programme of government spending. The Government proposes to embark on a housing scheme, and we know that both the Commonwealth and the State Governments have prepared big programmes of public works. The Minister for Transport spoke of the standardization of railway gauges at a co3t of £76,000,000. Is it seriously suggested that these undertakings are to be financed, with interest-free money issued by the Commonwealth Bank at a time when there is a vast amount of purchasing power in the hands of the people - purchasing power at present frozen by government controls? If the policy advocated by the Minister for Transport be adopted, there must be, in order to prevent inflation, an extension of control* even more rigid than those in force dur-' ing the war; alternatively controls will be discarded, and we shall embark upon a wild inflationary course. I challenge honorable members opposite, who know3 something of this subject, to contest my proposition. It is not without significance that no honorable member on the Government side, who is accepted as being anything of an authority on financial matters - I instance the Treasurer and the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> - has endorsed the theories of the Minister for Transport. I have discussed them "now because they represent the sort of mob appeal which is designed to attract political support, while the people are being blinded to the real threat to their interests. </para>

                    <para>There are three features of the bill which typify the Government's growing tendency to filch, the authority of Parliament, and to regiment individuals in accordance with the philosophy  of socialism. The first is the provision for freezing all surplus deposits of the private banks with the Commonwealth Bank at the figure at which they stood in August, 1939. We can understand the use of this provision in time of war in order to prevent inflation, but what will be its effect upon the country if such a policy is persisted in indefinitely after the war? I am. not speaking on behalf of the trading banks, as such. I have no particular reason to state their point of view, except insofar as it expresses my own belief that in the system of private banking there exists an important guarantee of the liberty of the individual. I have said .before that I firmly believe in a strong central bank directing the volume of credit in Australia by the exercise of some control over the activities of the private trading banks, but, subject to this control, the private banks should be able to render a competitive service to the public, thus guaranteeing to individuals economic liberty. By a process of slow strangulation of the private banks, this bill will restrict the opportunities of young Australians of this, and future generations, to enjoy the advantages of economic liberty. There has been no intimation from the Government, nor are  Ave  likely to receive one, that the bank reserves now frozen will be allowed to thaw out in any appreciable number of years, it at all; so we must examine the consequences of the present proposal. The first is that the capacity of the private trading banks to lend will be limited to their capacity in this direction as in August, 1939. Actually, their capacity will be diminished, because the value of the currency since then has diminished by ait least 22 per cent. We may assume that, in the next few years, some of the clients of the trading banks will drop out from various causes, such as death or business failure. To that limited extent, the hanks will be able to deal with new business, but that is likely to be more than offset hy the fact that the present clients of tie banks, in order to develop their businesses, will need increased financial accommodation. We may say, therefore, that the capacity of the trading banks to lend to new borrowers after the war will be negligible. Thus, a young </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian, perhaps an ex-serviceman, who wants to go into business will be forced, whether he likes it or not, to seek financial accommodation from the Commonwealth Bank. He will not .be able to go from, one bank to another in search of better terms or conditions. </para>
                    <para>The second important feature of the bill is contained in clause 27, perhaps the most dangerous and significant clause of the whole bill. This is the clause which gives the Commonwealth Bank power to determine, not the volume of credit which shall be available to the community at any time, but the manner in which it shall be employed. The Commonwealth Bank may, under this clause, direct the trading banks as to the classes of purposes for which advances may or may not he made. Outside those countries ruled by dictators, I do not think that such far-reaching power has been exercised over the banking system of any country in the world. I do not know of any country, where it is claimed that a vestige of liberty remains, which has given power to the central bank to state in what direction credit shall be made available. It is true that there is a safeguard. It is provided in sub-clause 3, which reads -  (3.) Nothing in this section shall - </para>

                    <para class="block">The power of direction of the Commonwealth Bank is to be general in that sense, but that does not afford any real protection to the individual, because the same government which can determine in what channels credit shall flow will also be able to control, through other departments, what resources are to be available. This form of control has been exercised during the war for war purposes, but it is apparently to be continued after the war through the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. So, although there is apparently some protection for the individual in that the banks are not to be given instructions to deny an advance to any particular person, that person can well be denied the rights which would normally be available to him to develop industry, even  along channels laid down by the Commonwealth Bank, because of the refusal of other Commonwealth departments to make available to him the necessary materials that he would require for his projects. This process of what is known as qualitative control of credit is one of the most dangerous that this Parliament could undertake in banking policy. It has been shown throughout history that where you give government control in this way over matters involving financial benefits to groups of persons, you lay open the most fertile opportunities for corruption within governments and within the Government service itself. I repeat that I have yet to be shown that qualitative direction, of credit is operating in any country other than those under socialistic dictatorships. Yet here we are embarking on it. I pause at ibis point to quote to the House a short passage from Hayek's book,The <inline font-style="italic">Road to Serfdom.</inline> He had, as readers of his book well know, a very close knowledge of what has been done in this regimenting process in central Europe.

                    <para class="block">At the appropriate stage in committee, I shall test the Government's bona fides on this matter. It says that this clause gives statutory effect to the recommendation of the royal commission. In committee, I will move that the clause be worded in conformity with the recommendation of the royal commission. We shall then see how much good faith there is in the advice that this Government purports to give to this House, including its own supporters, who, apparently, have not bothered to read the bill  thoroughly; otherwise, they would know that the advice is false. I remind honorable members that they ought not to let out of their minds that the bank means the Treasurer, and the Treasurer means the caucus and all that flows from that fact. Thisclause gives the bank, and, through the bank, these other  influences,  power to determine the direction of these advances. I do not want to labour the point. I think I have made it sufficientlyclear. I merely refer again to the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> yesterday, as to how disastrous this could be in the hands of the bank. He spoke  of  the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States of America and the depression it precipitated in 1937 by interference with economic conditions, which were developing in that country. Assuredly, if some government department, this banking institution, sets itself up to decide where it, will be wise  for  Australian investments to proceed,  we shall  get the same chaos and dislocation of industry as was experienced in the United States of America. Who is  lively  to be the better judge of whether an investment is sound and likely to be profitable than men with their own hard cashto invest, risking, perhaps, a lifetime of effort, in carrying through a project? Surely, not some government officer sitting in his own room and not personally involved in what may happen to that project! I know whom I would back with my money, and I am certain that the country does  too.  Here again we have  an  in-tance of Parliament surrendering  to  the Executive and the bank what is really publicpolicy as  to  whether there should be development in certain directions or not. If the Government decides that it  is  necessary that we should have economic development along certain defined channels, what is to prevent it from bringing a bill before this Parliament in  order to  get the necessary appropriation and authority for. it? But it does not propose  to  do that. What it proposes  to  do is to use this back-door- method. </para>
                    <para>The third item to which I desire to refer is foreign exchange. No one would deny that there may be occasions in the life  of  the country  on  which control over foreign exchange transactions may become necessary. We had such a crisis in the depression. We have abnormal circumstances of war which also make necessary control of foreign exchange. But those occasions are not so frequent in the life of the nation that it is not practicable for Parliament to be consulted at any time it is proposed to impose severe restrictions upon the use of foreign exchange. This control of foreign exchange is not the innocent or harmless process that it may appear on the surface. I come back again to Hayek, who makes a pregnant comment on the highly political use that may be made by the Executive of its control over foreign exchange. At page 90 of hisbook he says - </para>

                        <para>The extent of the control overall life that economic control confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign exchanges. Nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange and most people will regard its introduction with complete indifference. Yet the experience of most continental countrieshas taught thoughtful people to regard this stop as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty. It is in fact, that complete delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the State, thefinal suppression of all means of escape - not merely for the rich, but for everybody. Once the individual is no longer free to travel, no longer free to buy foreign boohs or journals, once all means of foreign contact can he restricted to those of whom official opinion approves or for whom it is regarded as necessary, the effective control of opinion is much greater than that ever exercised by any of the absolutist governmentsof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, </para>

As the honorable member for Balaclava, with his long experience as Minister for Trade and Customs knows, this enables the Executive to cut right across the tariff policy of this country, prescribed by the Parliament. The government of the day could permit or prohibit the importation of goods at will. What place has a clause of that kind in such a measure as this? [f Parliament is prepared to forfeit control over tariff policy and its own determination whether certain goods should or  should  not be imported, let us have a proper measure brought before us and let us have this properly ventilated. Do not try to sneak it in as a minor sub-clause in a banking bill. A tremendous possibility is opened up by this ' sub-clause, which provides an opportunity for the Executive of the day, without reference to the Parliament, to determine the trading, policy of the country. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> pointed out last night that a government with a strong tendency to foster, say. secondary industries at the expense of primary industries, could act behind  the back of Parliament in such a way aa to destroy the capacity of the primary producers to trade with other countries.

                        HOLT.- Yes, that is the only explanation. "God is on the side of the big battalions ", a general once  said,  and apparently the view of the Government ie that right is with, the mighty majority. I mention these matters because they demonstrate how the Parliament is being deprived of its authority to speak for the people. The historic process whereby power has been taken from the Executive and. exercised, through the Parliament, for the people, has  been  reversed. In this bill we have an instance of private enterprise .being destroyed almost at a blow, and its destruction will involve the destruction of the liberty of the individual. Where private enterprise has flourished, freedom of mind and body has .been guaranteed. Where private enterprise has been murdered by collectivist laws :md government strangulation, freedom of mind and body has died. This bill strikes a deadly blow at private enterprise and at Parliament. It casts the dark cloud of regimentation across the clear blue sky of Australian freedom.

                        <para>- The honorable member cries, parrot fashion, " full regimentation".No other government in the history of Australia regimented the people more than did the government of which the honorable member belonged during the years of the bank-created depression.He talks about freedom, which is the antithesis of regimentation. The only freedom that the workers of Australia knew during the years when he was a Minister was the freedom to starve. </para>

That was made clearby the speeches they delivered on the Commonwealth Bank Bill and are delivering on this measure. Hereis another report of a speech by a prominent Australian officer.

            <para class="block">CriticalCommentbyOfficer. </para>
            <para class="block">According to Lieutenant-Colonel M. Ashkanasy, who was in charge of the AdjutantGeneral's branch in Malaya and New Guinea, a disconcertingly large proportion of soldiers, at the time they came into the Army early in the war, showed signs of malnutrition and under-nourishment.  Colonel Ashkanasy  said that after the fall of Singapore, when the remaining men regarded themselves as condemnedmen, likely to die in a few days, a talk among them revealed that with few exceptions these men were entirely unprepared for a situation of that kind, and had no full appreciation of the ideals for which they were sacrificing themselves. Few of the men had any faith or philosophy of any kind. He felt strongly that it was a great weakness, and unjust to the men who had to submit to that ordeal. It was not the fault of the chaplains, who at that time had to carry out a variety of work. He was satisfied that, generally speaking, the Australian soldiers had risen considerably from that condition, and when they came back they would bring with them a deeper idealism and deeper spiritual note. </para>
            </quote><para>When the banking legislation now before the Parliament becomes operative there will be no malnutrition and no undernourishment in Australia - at least so long as a Labour government remains in office to administer the legislation. We can at least give that pledge to the people of Australia. Honorable gentlemen opposite, with their record of stygian blackness, can make no promises and give no assurances to the people about the future. If they should happen, by some mischance, to he returned to power the outlook will be poor indeed as the speeches of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> have clearly indicated. These honorable gentlemen say that they disagree with the provisions of clause 27 which provides that the Commonwealth Bank may determine the policy in relation to advances to be followed by the trading banks. I can see nothing wrong and a great deal that is commendable in that provision. Apparently the Opposition favours adherence to the bad old policy of the depression years when the banks contracted credit in a disgraceful way. At that time the clients of the banks were informed that they must reduce their overdrafts because a banking inspector, or the Board of Directors of the bank, had decided that that policy should be applied. In the final analysis, this Parliament should dictate policy on that subject. The policy of the private banks would certainly not contribute in any way to the provision of full employment for- everybody, but would undoubtedly lead to unemployment, as it has always done. Honorable gentlemen opposite seem to be antagonistic to this measure because it might have the effect of preventing private banks or financial institutions from building large blocks of flats, or assisting people to engage in luxury trades of one kind or another designed solely to increase private profit. This Government considers that home building should have a high priority, and it may find it necessary to say to the directors of banks that, as credit is not inexhaustible, a substantial proportion of the credit available should be devoted to projects that will yield the greatest good for the greatest number of people. That is a sound axiom. This bill will ensure that the private banks will not be able to apply a policy which will be definitely against the best interests of the people. "What I have said about the depression is in accord with a statement published in a report of the International Labour Conference of 1937, as follows : - </para><quote>

When the Japanese were very close to our shores, and on what was, for us, the wrong side of the Owen Stanley Range, only 40 miles from Port Moresby, honorable gentlemen opposite were very much in favour of a new order. Any order that meant the salvation of their lives and the retention of their property was acceptable to them. But as the Japanese danger receded these honorable gentlemen lost their enthusiasm for a new order, and are now doing their  utmost  to ensure a continuation of the bad old order under which capitalism would be able to function in the bad old way. They desire that there shall be a constant reservoir of unemployed people from which employers will be able to draw workers whenever they desire to do so, and to which they will be able to throw the men hack when they have finished with them. </para><para>We shall have about 25 years in  this  country to decide whether we intend to make proper use of our second opportunity to survive. If we do not do so, we certainly shall not survive. We cai! survive only if we can provide full employment for our people under a constantly expanding economy. We should be able to attract people to this country from other parts of the world, but if  we  have an unemployment problem here  we  shall not be  able  to do that. It is surely clear to everybody that if we are to increase our population to anything like the 20,000,000 that some people talk about we must change our economic system. The had old days must not return to this country.  Surely,  it will not be said of us, as was said of the Bourbons of France, that we learn nothing and forget nothing. The people of Australia desire a change from the bad old order of .the days gone by. </para><para>The spectacle of the members of the Australian Country party opposing  this  legislation is amazing, for country people remember all too vividly how the private banking institutions treated them in the days of the depression. The previous Labour Government in 1931 endeavoured to pass through this Parliament a Fiduciary Notes Bill which would have assured to the farmers 5s. 6d. a bushel for wheat which, at that time, they were obliged to sell for ls. lOd. a bushel; but they were prevented, from doing so by the parliamentary members of the Australian Country party who favoured not the farmers but the Pitt-street and Collins-street farmers who farm the farmers. 1 have been making an investigation with the object of ascertaining whether the people at large are in favour of the financial measures which the Government has introduced, and' I have learned tha*, many people who do not ordinarily vote for the Labour party, intend to vote for it in the future, because of its financial reform policy. The people realize that in the years when the Country party dominated the politics of this country very little genuine help was given to the primary producers or the workers. </para><para>I desire to make some remarks concerning the observations of the honorable member for Fawkner, who expressed the opinion that the trading banks could be trusted to decide the banking policy of this country. The fact is that from the inauguration of banking in Australia in 1817, when the Bank of New South "Wales was established, down to the present day, banks have periodically failed. Almost every decade has witnessed booms and slumps of a minor or major character, and these invariably act ultimately with great severity on bank depositors and shareholders alike. During the discussion of the Commonwealth Bank Bill, I referred to the collapse in Victoria of twelve banks, with the result that £S0,000,000 belonging to their depositors was confiscated and converted into interminable securities or preference shares. I have since made further investigations, which disclose that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs, Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Downer, Premier of South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Patterson, Premier of Victoria, met in. Melbourne on Saturday, the 27th May, 1893. to discuss the effects of the bank smashes on the clients of those institutions as well as on the people generally in their colonies.

                <para>A statement has been made this week, that the Federal Bank of Australia, which is in liquidation also intends to reconstruct. We cannot however regard the statement as serious. Since this bank has closed its doors particulars of the overdraft book have reached us and our increased  knowledge  - like Goethe, we are always asking for more light - discloses the deplorable fact that the Federal Bank was most shamefully depleted of itf cash by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Munro, his sons, soninlaw, and other relatives and " tentacles " whilst the other directors have also used the bank for their own purpose, as will be seen from the particulars below. Nine amounts in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Munro is mixed up. amount to £161,237. What the value of these assets are, may be judged from the fact that the bank before it closed its doors, accepted 6d. in the £1 for something likea quarter of a million sterling and gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Munro and other parties a legal release. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> Munro, a son of the Honorable James Munro, who owed £28,526. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Munro, another son, owes in his own name £26,161. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> Munro, a third son, owes £8,000.

That was the commencement of the Baillieu wealth. </para><para>I could speak at length upon what happened at that period in regard to both the banks that did not re-open, and the banks that closed their doors and afterwards were reconstructed. Some of them did not complete, for many years, the payment of money owing to their depositor?. The English, Scottish and Australian Bankhas never repaid one penny of the £2,000,000 that itowes. Despite the repeated efforts continued up to 1923, by the representatives of the deposit holders, to persuade the directors to pay 20s. in the£,all efforts in that direction have been unavailing. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mountjoy)</inline> has handed to me a letter he has received from one of his electors in Western Australia whose parents lost their all in the collapse of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank. I, too, have received correspondence from all over Australia, supporting statements that other honorable members and I have made in this House in condemnation of the financial manipulations in the last decade of the last century by practically all the directors of all the banks in Australia. One authority on banking gave evidence before the royal commission appointed by the Government of Victoria to examine a proposal for the establishment of a State bank, following the collapse of the other banks. He was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilmour</inline> Brown. In my opinion, what he then said of the banking institu tions of his day is skill true. This is what he said- </para><quote>
                <para>The banking system as it now stands is a disgrace to civilizedcommunities. Itplaces in the hands of a small committee, the Bankers' Association, a power greater than that of the Government - without its responsibility to the country. </para>

                <para>They are a financial absolutism. They  levy direct taxes,  on  the  enterprise, industry  and  production of the community.

            </quote><para>This bill is designed to alter that state of affairs. Because they fear a change, the banking institutions of Australia, through their political representatives in this Par. liament, are making a futile effort to prevent, the enactment of the legislation. All the levies they have made on themselves, and all their expenditure on newspaper advertisements, in radio propaganda, and in other directions, will be of no avail, because the legislation will be passed; and when it has reached the statute-book,  it  will neverbe repealed. The people of Australia will not vote for the Liberal party, with the restoration of the Bank Board and the repeal of this legislation as the principal issues at the next Common wealth elections. When the people can obtain cheap money, as they will be able to do under the Commonwealth Bank bill, when they can obtain advances readily and are not required to reduce advances on good security, they certainly will not vote themselves back into economic serfdom - a condition that has existed for  so  long. I draw the attention of honorable members to aresolution passed by the Public Service Association of New South Wales, endorsing the Government's banking legislation. It appears in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of the 4th April last. The Public Service Association can be regarded as representative of a fair cross section of the Australian community. It  represents  many persons who live on small wages, as well as many who may reasonably be regarded as belonging to the middle class. The conference, with practically no opposition, passed a resolution which contained these words - </para><quote>

They were reduced to penury at the time, and some are living on old age pensions to-day, because they were robbed by banking institutions. There were  17,000  houses empty in Melbourne at the end of the last century. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman's spiritual predecessors of four or five decades ago were responsible, just as he and his party were responsible for houses being empty throughout Australia during the depression. The existence of such settlements as Happy Valley on Botany Bay and Dudley Flats in Melbourne and the fact that some people have bad to live on mud-flats on the banks &lt;&gt;f the Molonglo River here in Canberra are directly traceable to his Government's failures. I no not need to go through the whole gamut. Houses were empty because people could not pay the rent that was asked for them. </para>

                        <para>- It was the result of the international manipulation of finance. If the honorable gentleman will take the trouble to read what I said in my previous speech, he will realize that even some of the people who support him politically have stated the truth concerning the origin of the depression. Governments were almost held to ransom during those awful years. To return to conditions in Victoria years after the bank crashes, I can recall going with my family, when I was a little boy, to live in  a  two-story house in a terrace of nine houses, three of which were empty at the time. A.n ex-police sergeant was permitted to occupy one house rent free, in order that he might act as caretaker of all of them. That was as recently as  1905.  Seventy-five thousand people were driven out. of Victoria between  1895  and  1900  because they could not get work. The fortunate discovery of gold in Western Australia provided them with an opportunity to secure full, remunerative employment. Many people in Victoria at that time lived on the remittances that came from Western Australia. There was no old-age or invalid pension in those days. Many members in this House and the Senate can relate the story of that period. Two members of the present Ministry went to Western Australia to find work ; one is the Minister for La'bour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> and the other is the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron).</inline> I have heard from the Postmaster-General that thousands of men, forming a queue half a mile long, used to stand outside the post offices ai Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie on a Saturday afternoon awaiting their turn to buy postal notes and money orders to send back to their people in the eastern States. That sort of thing will not be repeated  30  long as the Australian people maintain their sanity. So long as they keep in office a Labour government that will guard them from the depredations of the banking institutions they are safe, but if they listen to the siren voices of the agents of the banks they will experience after this war a depression more terrible and more extensive in its effects than was that of the first nine years of the third decade of this century. The effects of the last depression were felt right up to the outbreak of this war. We have it on the authority of the Leader of the Opposition that, at the outbreak of the war, there were  250.000  persons out of work in Australia. When war came, unemployment vanished. Strange as it may seem, there is never full employment in time of peace, but in time of war there is always a shortage of man-power. We are determined that <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> shall not return to conditions under which there is a surplus of man-power. The resources of this country still remain co be developed. Australia is still practically in the pioneering stage. It can be made a great country, but if it is to be great every policy, whether relating co banking, taxation, or tariffs, must be soundly framed. This legislation in regard to banking is on the right lines. </para>

                    <para>.- One might describe these two banking measures as twin bills of ill intent, because they are intended to destroy the present banking system. No government supporter will deny that. The purpose of this legislation is to set up a monopoly of the worst kind - a government monopoly, under which the Government shall control finance and commerce in this British democracy. In this effort to sell us socialism, it is useless to harp on bank crashes of 50 years ago, or on the economic depression of a decade ago. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has a phobia against the press, and a penchant for throwing mud at individuals, which has earned for him the sobriquet of " Minister for Defamation ". In the course of his speech, he cast certain aspersions upon me, which I could afford to trent lightly but that his words are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and so I must answer them lest some one might believe them, coming as they did from a reputedly responsible man. He spoke of returned soldiers who, during the depression, worked on the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne, at dole rates, while I drove by in my limousine unperturbed. I was a Minister in the Lyons Government for six years and that Government has never received full credit for what it did to get people back into employment. The right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> knew what the difficulties were. He took measures to rectify the trade balance, and we in Opposition gave him our support. Later, when we assumed office, we revised the tariff schedule and took measures regarding exchange </para>

                        <para>- In case the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has suffered a lapse of memory, I remind him that the unemployment figure was 25 per f-ent. when the Lyons Government camp into office, whereas in 1938 it was down to 10 per cent., which is very close to the normal percentage for any country. The causes of the depression were not local. It was a world-wide depression, and from it wo have learned a great deal. What wo learned, then and since will enable n« to cope more quickly and more successfully with any similar situation in the future. There is no need for revolutionary measures. As for the gibe of the Minister for Information that I rode luxuriously in a motor car, I point out to honorable members that never during my long term as a Minister did I have a ministerial car, and as for my alleged attitude to returned soldiers, let me say that I have been associated with the services for 40 years and have served in two wars. I suggest to Ministers of the present Government that in these days of scarcity of petrol and rubber, they should not drive in ministerial cars from Melbourne to Canberra, and vice versa, when they could travel by train. I would not have touched on this matter but for the Minister's gibe. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to listen to the cheers of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> because I prefer his straightforward advocacy of socialism to the subtle methods of those who seek to attain the same end by devious means. The Minister for Transport is a straightout advocate of the proposal to make banking and commerce a government monopoly. The purpose of this bill is to regulate private banking, and one of its clauses provides for the freezing of the banks' assets. That is only another way of effecting a capital levy. When the Minister for Information speaks to his supporters on the Yarra bank he says, " Let us sock the rich ; let us make a capital levy ". That is a well-known socialist shibboleth. The Government is proposing to reach the same goal in a more subtle way, namely, by hampering the activities of the private banks. It proposes to freeze their funds, and so to prevent them from expanding, no matter how much Australia may develop. If perfection could be attained by government control of banking we all would support it, but the history of government enterprise is not such as to encourage us to take a hopeful view of the Government's proposals. We can imagine the treatment which will be accorded by a government-controlled bank to men who, after the war, will have to approach it for financial accommodation. I have instanced in this House the colossal waste on buildings and plant by this Government during the war. A person going to the government bank for an overdraft will be referred to this person and that person, and there will be countless forms to fill in. Finally, he will get a quite impersonal reply. The private banks are commercial institutions. There is a personal relationship, especially in country areas, between the banks and the customers, and finance will be provided if the customer is credit-worthy. It is a fallacy to say that banks can create unlimited credit. They can only advance under the cheque and overdraft system up to the risk that they are prepared to take. Some of them are prepared to take more than others. But they will not go beyond the securities left by their customers, nor give them greater cheque accommodation than is warranted. What would be the relationship between the community and a State bank? Some of the greatest development in the British Empire, of which we are proud to be members, has been through the understanding and knowledge of commerce that operate in the activities of the private banks. Lord Nuffield, who was a bicycle repairer in his native town of Oxford, attributed the beginnings of his great success to the time he approached his banker for an overdraft, and got it, because he had designed a new type of motor car. He has prospered since then and is not only a great employer, </para>

                        <para>- It is, because so many of the honorable gentleman's colleagues talk so lightheartedly about this foolish policy of the Government. I hope I shall make them capable of thinking in a gloomy way. One clause provides for government control of all of the exchange of the Commonwealth. During the depression, our government was faced with great difficulties, but it did its utmost to provide employment and make trade flow, and by 1938 Australia was the second largest buyer in the Empire from Great Britain and the biggest dominion seller to Great Britain. That was proof that Australia's trade had revived considerably. As the right honorable member for Cowper said, the exchange position had to be carefully weighed, and we made provision for a rebate on tariff protection to compensate in some measure for our adverse exchange. By allowing the currency to depreciate slightly, we permitted the transfer of money from the primary producers to others within the Commonwealth, and the tariff concession assisted the purchasing of commodities and implements at reasonable prices within Australia. Under the tariff laws the Government has all the powers that it needs to control trade after the war.

                        <para>- Yes, and the people will realize then the depths of the Government's infamy. When the board is abolished, the master ofour destinies in the commercial world will be the Treasurer, who hassaid that, in his opinion, the best service to the community can be given only , by a banking system from which the profit motive is absent. From now on, he will be in control of the commercial destiny of all of the people in. the Commonwealth, because finance is the corner-stone of commerce. He will have to take the blame largely for the Government's administration of this legislation. He must do what the caucus tells him to do, and if, in the caucus, the very vocal Minister for Information (Mr.Cal well) and the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> say, " Look here, boys, we are going to inflate the currency four or five hundred per cent.", he will have to do what they say. Anybody with the most elementary knowledge of finance knows that, if the note issue is increased without an equivalent increase of production and services, the value of the notes in circulation is depreciated. </para>

The honorable member and his colleagues on the Government side of the chamber profess to be opposed to monopolies, and yet, in supporting this hill, they are supporting the worst form of monopoly, namely, a Government monopoly.

                        <para>- I have never evicted anybody in my life, much less a returned soldier. On the contrary, I have helped many ex-servicemen. I was a member of the government which inquired into war service homes in 1935, and, although the War Service Homes Commission launched a number of prosecutions with successful results, that government prevented evictions, except in a few cases. I have looked up the details recently, and I know that in the year 1932-33, nobody was evicted, in the following year one man was evicted, and in the year after that four men were evicted. Thus, in three years, only five men out of hundreds were evicted;, and in each instance the government found another house for the man. Furthermore, that  government  reduced the rate of interest charged to the purchasers of war service homes and went on with a policy of building. It built 21,000 homes, whereas the present miserable apology for a government hatbuilt only 31 in five years, although th, Treasurer has said that there is plenty of finance and there are thousands of allotments of land available. That is vastly different from the performance of the government which carried on under difficulties during the depression, when the people were lightly taxed. Our people are being taxed more heavily than the people in any other country. Yet, as 1 Lave pointed out, the Government hat given assistance to only 756 out of 2,194 applicants for re-establishment grants. Why were 642 applications refused? These men had served the nation, and they thought that they were returning to a norma] world in which they might obtain some of the good thing* enjoyed, by those who have not fought for their country and who have never had a headache, missed a meal, or lost a night's sleep during the war. They reasonably expected that the Government would make available to them this beggarly allowance of £250 to help to reestablish them in business. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government would .put its hand to the plough and deal with the real problems that confront it, it would not bring down an unwanted bill for the nationalization of finance. The subject to which I was referring involved a matter of finance with which the Government should deal instead of this nebulous scheme that nobody wants. It is paradoxical that, while we are engaged in what we hope is the last phase of the greatest upheaval in history, and while the best of our people are hotly engaging the enemy, the Government is bringing down measures of a totalitarian kind behind their backs. We should be the defenders of democracy, but somehow, in these years of rules, regulations and regimentation, democratic principles have been forgotten. The Government might well have abandoned this measure. The revolutionary changes which it proposes are not equalled in any other British country. Mention has been made of New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- This legislation will enable the Government to harass and obstruct the private banks. The postwar activities of these institutions will be curtailed severely. A substantial proportion of their assetswill be frozen, and the Commonwealth Bank will turn the full blast of competition upon them. That competition will be unfair, because the Commonwealth Bank is not called upon to meet many commitments imposed upon private banks, such as taxation and other contributions to the Treasury. If the Government can take this action to control the banking field, it can also embark upon new ventures in other fields. Power to do these things was sought by the Commonwealth Government at the referendum, but its proposals were defeated. Now, covertly, and dishonestly, the Government is circumventing the referendum by bringing down legislation which is socialistic, totalitarian and opposed to the spirit of the people. Australian citizens will not forget this. The next elections cannot come soon enough for them, because then there will be a new government on the treasury bench, and this infamous measure will be repealed. </para>

                    <para>.-I wish to raise a question which I regard as of- very great importance. It relates to trade between Australia and India. I realize that problems such as this are not without many difficulties, and that during the past few months, this matter has been receiving some consideration. Interest in it was heightened by the presence in this country some weeks ago of an Indian trade delegation, which interviewed representatives of the Government, and toured all States of the Commonwealth. No doubt, its members applied their business knowledge and experience to this subject. My interest in the matter was increased recently when a liberty ship arrived at a Tasmanian port to load cement. I am reliably informed that the vessel arrived at that port in ballast. In view of the world-wide shortage of shipping, that seems rather strange. Is there any reason why ships coming to this country to carry our exportable goods to other parts of the world should not bring in cargoes from India, such as jute bags, tea, cotton goods, or carpets?Carpets are in very short supply in this country to-day, and prices are high. Many people are endeavouring to set up house and they require carpets, leather furnishings, and so on. These goods, I am informed., could be obtained from India.Indian carpets are composite articles, but people who have lived in India for many years tell  me thattheirquality is excellent, andthatthey would be very suitableforthis country. If we are tobuildupreciprocaltradewith India,hereisoneitemwhichwecould importinsubstantialquantities. </para>

                <para>The desirability of utilizing the ser vices of such a committee, will, no doubt be appreciated because there is a point beyond which a public department, no matter how sympathetic, cannot and should not go. Moreover, the committee includes blinded soldiers of the Great War, who are men of standing and skill. I would point out that the  chairman  in New South Wales is Captain H. Gilbert Nobbs, who lost his sight on the Western Front when serving with the British Expeditionary Force. In businesslife he is the  chairman  and managing director of Holbrooks (Australasia) Proprietary Limited, and he gives his best, in an honorary capacity, as a business man and a blinded officer, in assisting the younger men of this war. I am grateful for the work which he and his colleagues so generously and effectively perform. </para>
                <para>On the 19 th June, the honorable member or Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> addressed a question to me without notice on the subject of the War Service Hornet Commission making advances for the purpose of erecting homes on leasehold lands in Queensland. I have had inquiries made and now desire to inform the honorable member that the provisions of the War Service Homes Act 1918-1941 do not permit the commission to grant loans in respect of leasehold property, other than where the fee-simple of the land is held by the Commonwealth itself, as in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. Generally, in the case of leasehold tenure, other than that of the Commonwealth, should default on. the part of the borrower occur at any time, the improvements effected revert to the lessor and the rights of the Commonwealth, as the authority advancing the funds to provide the improvements, would be subordinated to those of the lessor. Obvious difficulties would arise from this dual control over the improvements, and for the reasons mentioned, the Commonwealth has found itself unable to authorize the War Service Homes Commission to make loans in respect of any leasehold, other than one the fee-simple of which is held by the Commonwealth itself. </para>

                    <para>. - I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed.]</inline> I called for a quorum, not so that honorable members might have the pleasure of listening to my oratory, but because I intend to raise a matter that is of very great and immediate importance to the people of Victoria, and I do not want it to be almost entirely ignored. In consequence of a strike in the only sugar refinery in Victoria, at Yarraville, sugar refining has been at a standstill since the 14th May. This is not the first hold-up of sugar refining in Victoria within recent months: there have been four serious industrial stoppages at the Yarraville refinery since October, 1944. There was a stoppage lasting one week in December, 1944, another lasting six days from the 11th January, and a third lasting twelve days from the 31st January of this year. The latest stoppage commenced on the 14th May, and has continued ever since. A direct result of all these stoppages has been to deprive not merely the housewives of a basic food, but also the factories engaged on urgent food processing of a basic commodity that they need in their production, which is required for both internal consumption, and export to our own services and to the British Navy. It is not my purpose to canvass at this stage the merits of the dispute. Independent industrial tribunals for the investigation of matters in dispute have been established in Australia. Within the last couple of days, the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said in this House, We are here to govern, and we are going to govern ". From the viewpoint of the people of Victoria, the Administration has abandoned its responsibility to govern. This senseless and unnecessary industrial stoppage is depriving them of a basic food. Sugar is not a luxury, but an essential in every household. It is also essential to factories engaged in the processing of foods. Yet we have to tolerate for months the complete cessation of sugar refining operations in Victoria. Clearly, the men consider that they have a sound case. Equally clearly, the company considers that it has right on its side. My only concern is that the Government is prepared to allow an industrial dispute involving a mere handful of men to hold up indefinitely and unnecessarily the supply of a commodity that is needed by the Victorian housewife and is essential to food processing establishments. . How long does the Government expect this state of affairs to continue?I have no doubt that an appropriate industrial tribunal is available to hear the dispute. Already it has been investigated by a State wages board, as well as by the Registrar and the full bench of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court; consequently, there is no shortage of judicial investigators. If a decision can be given on the matters that are now keeping the parties apart, this Parliament should insist that it be given. Until that is done, the present chaotic state will continue. Some factories are dismissing employees, who are resentful of the action of fellow unionists. The time and labour wasted as the result of the hold-up of refining operations at Yarraville cannot be recovered during this year. There will be a diminution of the total volume of food that can be made available from this country to our allies and our own servicemen abroad. The strike is a direct challenge to the Government. It has the responsibility of ensuring that food supplies shall be maintained on behalf of not merely the people of Victoria, who have had to suffer considerable inconvenience for far too long, but also the people of the Commonwealth as a whole and our troops who are serving abroad. I ask the Government to indicate immediately when wo may expect the resumption ofsugar supplies in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>The Government's decision to set up a commission to inquire into the coal-mining industry has not resulted in fewer stoppages on the coal-fields. However, it is quite likely that more stoppages would have occurred during recent months if the commission had not been set up. Production figures for the period the 1st January, 1945, to the 19th May, 1945, showed, a slight increase ' over the figures for the same period last year. The reserves of coal held on the 19th May, 1945, was 7,432 tons less than that held at the end of 1944. The Government is taking, and will continue to take, every action possible te increase the production of coal. The Coal Commissioner and his staff have been unsparing in their efforts in this regard, and have been instrumental in averting many stoppages, and where stoppages have occurred, have been successful in arranging an early resumption of work. </para>

It is obvious from the report  of the Government Statist, which I  understand  was drawn up from a census taken by the police, that Victorian hay stocks were inequitably distributed. It is regrettable in view of this that the Victorian Government has consistently rejected the request of the Con mi on wealth and of Victorian Country party members that it acquire and distribute existing stocks of hay on an equitable basis. </para>

                            <para>The production and the distribution of fodder is the responsibility of the Victorian Department of Agriculture and it is not the intention of the Commonwealth to usurp State functions. The remedy for correcting the existing state of affairs in Victoria rests with rural electors. If they are convinced that there has been bungling of fodder distribution in Victoria, and there is no doubt that there has been, then I have no doubt that they will take appropriate action. The Commonwealth is still endeavouring to obtain increased supplies from North America and New Zealand to ease the acute shortage of fodder in our States. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth Government has received official information regarding the United Kingdom Government's price and marketing policy for agricultural' products which will be pursued during the period of the four-year plan for agriculture, i.e., for the period ending in the summer of 1948. </para>

                            <para>The main points are: - (i) The Government will determine prices for agricultural products after discussions with the National Farmers' Unions. The economic data to be used for price discussions between departments and the National Farmers' Unions will be based on financial accounts relating to different types of farming and sizes of farms and statistical material relating to costs of production, collected by means acceptable to the Government and the industry. These data will bc made available to the workers' unions which will be given an opportunity of expressing their views ; ( ii ) in February of each year there will be a review by the Agricultural Departments in consultation with the National Farmers' Unions of the general financial position of agriculture in the United Kingdom, based on the above economic and financial data and any other relevant statistical material which is available; (iii) during the period of the four-year plan ending in the summer of 1948, it is considered that some change in the pattern of United Kingdom agriculture may be required to meet changing national requirements in the transition from war to peace. Broadly, these changes will mean a gradual expansion of live-stock and live-stock products and a reduction from the high war-time levels of certain crops for direct human, consumption; (iv) it is desired to encourage a substantial increase in milk production and a revival in the rearing of cattle and sheep for meat production. For this purpose, an assured market and guaranteed minimum prices are being provided for milk, fat cat tlo, sheep and lambs, and calves produced during the four years up to the summer of 1948. Actual prices will be considered al each February review and subsequently fixed by the Government; (v) during the war, a large reduction has occurred in pig, poultry and egg production due to the shortage of feeding stuffs. The United Kingdom Government intends to encourage an expansion of these commodities to the fullest possible extent permitted by the supplies of  feedstuffs  which can be made available. An assured market will be provided for all fat pigs and eggs which are offered for sale during the four-year period. Prices will be considered at each annual February review and subsequently fixed by the Government; (vi) an assured market will be maintained for cereals, main crop potatoes and sugar beet up to and including the crops harvested in 1947. The prices of these crops will .be considered at each nunn al February review and subsequently fixed by the Government; (vii) in the event of an important change in the situation such as may arise from a sudden and substantial change in costs, it may be necessary to conduct a special review; (viii) there will be no automatic adjustment of prices. All relevant data will be considered and (except that no downward adjustment will be made in the guartp«l minimum prices for milk, cattle and  sheep) the .prices of all the above products will be subject to adjustment downwards or upwards; (ix) account will also be taken, in fixing these prices, of any change that may be required during the four-year period in the character of the agricultural output. It must' bo contemplated that, concurrently with the relaxation of pressure - when this becomes possible - 'for the maximum production of certain crops, eg., cereals and potatoes, prices of these crops will be reduced; (x) if, in the transition period, it is necessary to make any modification in the present methods anil marketing machinery by which these assurances are implemented, discussions with representatives of the farmers and the trades will take place; (xi) separate consideration will he given to the cose of fruit, vegetables, early potatoes, wool, flax and hops. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth Government has noted the plans proposed by the United Kingdom Government. Such a plan must necessarily have regard to aspects peculiar to the agriculture of the country concerned. Any action taken by the Commonwealth Government would deal with conditions of agriculture peculiar to Australia. The right honorable member is no doubt aware of the following statement made in the Government's white paper on full employment in Australia: - " The rural industries present a series of problems which the Rural Reconstruction Commission is at present examining. When the (commission's work i« complete, the Government will publish a detailed statement of its policy in relation to primary producers in a full employment economy, and set out the measures by which it is proposed to improve and stabilize their standards of living". </para>
