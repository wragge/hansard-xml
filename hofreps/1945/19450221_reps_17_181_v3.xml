        <para>The late gentleman was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Batman at the general elections in 1931, and was defeated at the general elections in 1934. I was not a member of the House during the period that he occupied a seat, consequently I had not personally made his acquaintance; but I know of his work, and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. </para>
        <para>It was, however, more particularly in the sphere of local government that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dennis</inline> gave outstanding service. He was for 36 years a member of the Northcote Council, and twice during that period occupied the position of mayor. He represented the council on the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for many years, and acted as vicechairman of the board. He was also closely associated with church and sporting club organizations, and his loss will be severely felt throughout the district in which he resided. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a valuable record of public service. I move - </para>

          <para>. - I second the motion. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has pointed out, the great bulk of a long period of public service rendered by the late gentleman was rendered in municipal politics; though he was in this House for  a period of three years. In addition to his work in municipal affairs, he was a man with very close and  a  variety of interests in church work, and in sporting bodies. Ina dozen ways he showed himself to be a good citizen. He is, perhaps, one of many proofs which we have had in Australia, that the foundation of a healthy public life is healthy, disinterested, honest local government. He played his part in that respect, and left behind him, particularly in his own city, a record which any man might envy. </para>

It has been the practice to obtain an early estimate of the sugar crop prospects for the season, and to give the British Government an intimation of the amount of sugar that can probably be made available. </para>

        <para class="block">With the exception of the last wheat contract (6th October, 1944), and the last Hour contract (19th January, 1944), the quantity contracted for has been supplied in all cases. The two last contracts are not yet completed, but it is anticipated that the full quantities will be supplied. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Eggs.</inline>-T he contract for the season 1939-40 was 900,000 long hundreds (300,000 cases, each 30 dozen eggs), and the quantity shipped was 340,641 cases. For 1940-41 the contract was for 412,000 cases, and 587,831 cases were shipped. </para>
        <para>Early in 1941 the British Government advised that refrigerated space would not be available for eggs in shell, and the Commonwealth Government then undertook to arrange for the processing of available eggs into dried powder. However, contracts for 200,000 cases in shell and 700 tons of pulp were accepted for the 1041-42 season, and the shipments made totalled 100,004 cases in shell together with the equivalent of 34,000 cases as egg pulp, 700 tons egg pulp, and 1,415 tons egg powder. </para>
        <para>During 1042-43, owing to the heavy increase in service demands in the Pacific area, only 115 tons egg powder were shipped. </para>
        <para>For 1943-44 no quantity was contracted for beyond any egg power available after providing for greatly increased service needs, and none was shipped. </para>
        <para>The British Government recently undertook to purchase the whole of the exportable surplus of eggs as powder, or, if circumstances permit, a? eggs in shell, for the seasons 1944-45 and 1345-46, and a quantity not exceeding 1,000,000 cases each 30 dozen eggs or their equivalent in egg powder for the season 1946-47. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Dairy Products.</inline>- 1939-40: The contract which covered the period November, 1939 to June, 1940, provided for 75,000 tons of butter and 13,000 tons of cheese, against which «0,8S2 tons of butter and 11,063 tons of cheese were shipped. 1040-41 : Despite the  difficulties  of supplying refrigerated shipping space, the British Government requested that 100,000 tons of butter and 20,000 tons of cheese be shipped. However, man-power difficulties were already being experienced and only 77,843 tons of butter and 10,118 tons of cheese were exported under the contra et. 11141-42: This year there was a change in the policy of the British Government in that the principal demand was for cheese, which mcn nt that manufacturers of butter were asked to install cheese plants. The contract covered up to 57,000 tons of butter and 40,000 tons of cheese, and the quantities shipped were 46,847 tons of butter and 6,569 tons of cheese. 1942- 43: During the year the demand again changed back to butter as being first priority, but heavy demands were made on Australian production . by the Australian and Allied services based on Australia. The quantities asked for by the United Kingdom were 70,000 t.ms of butter and 10,000 tons of cheese, whilst the shipments were 48,911 tons of butter and 6.067 tons of cheese. 1943- 44: In this year, whilst the British Government did first mention 55,000 tons of butter, the final allocation was arrived at after agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia on the basis of the maximum quantity available, viz., 40,000 tons. The actual shipments totalled 41,564 tons. </para>
        <para>Wherever possible, the necessary diversions of whole milk to condenseries to meet the condensed and dried milk demands of the services wore made from cheese factories as the United Kingdom Government had indicated that after the butter quota had been met it would take any surplus up to 10,000 tons of cheese. A quantity of 3,750 tons of cheese was shipped. 1044-45". The position for this year is that the British Government requires 50,000 tons cf butter and any cheese that is available. </para>
        <para>However, it is estimated that the heavy demands of the services on the reduced production owing to the long drought will only permit the export of a maximum of 40,000 tons of butter. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Meat.</inline>- 1939-40: The contract provided for 240,000 tons of carcass meat, against which shipments totalled 272,000 tons. 1940- 41: The quantity originally mentioned for this year was 81,000 tons including 54,000 tons for the services. This big reduction from the previous year was suggested because of shipping difficulties. Subsequently, quantities were increased to 154,000 tons and then to 198,000 tons. Actual shipments were recorded at 200,500 tons. 1941- 42: The British Government informed the Commonwealth Government that the maximum refrigerated tonnage which could be made available for shipment of meat from Australia would be 110,000 tons for the contract year. At the same time a request was made for Australia to endeavour to ship meat in other than fresh frozen form, namely canned and dehydrated. Shipments of fresh frozen meat made from Australia were 112,703 tons. 1942- 43: Refrigerated shipping space was the predominant factor in this year, during which increasingly heavy demands were being made on this country for supplies for our own armed forces and for American and Allied forces based on Australia. </para>
        <para>The British Government requested from Australia maximum quantities of meat available after Australian civilian and all service requirements had been mct. </para>
        <para>Shipments of fresh frozen meat totalled 105,751 tons, against the nominal contract figure of 110,000 tons, while the carcass equivalent of canned meats was 28,000 tons, and dehydrated moat 4,321 tons, the over-all total being 138,072 tons carcass equivalent. These figures do not include British Admiralty requirements which were met in full. 194.3-44: A slightly different procedure was adopted in regard to 1944, when the Commonwealth Government, after consultation and agreement with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, allocated 1944 meat production on the basis of demands. </para>
