                        <para>- My attention has been drawn to a press paragraph on the subject. It is true that particulars of a number of areas which the Government of New South Wales thinks are suitable for settlement by ex-servicemen have been submitted to my department; they came into my hands at the end of last week. [ am not quite sure whether it would be appropriate at this stage to make available the general particulars of the areas. We have to determine their suitability and how much i'. would cost to make them suitable for soldier settlement. The agreements between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments - which have yet to be ratified by this Parliament - provide that the areas for soldier settlement shall be brought to such a stage of production that the settlers will have a good opportunity to make a living. A good deal of detailed investigation will have to be made and negotiations of a somewhat delicate nature will perhaps have to be undertaken. </para>

                        <para>- Does the statement made recently by the Acting Prime Minister that all members of the Army and Air Force with operational service overseas, who have had over five years of war service, will be given the opportunity to take their discharge, mean1 that all those who come within that category will, upon making application obtain their discharge? Does this decision apply to all members regardless of their rank, or the areas in which they are serving? Will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to ensure that such discharges shall lie effected within a short period from the date of application, such period to be specified, in order to obviate undue delay in the release of these men? </para>

                            <para>- In reply to a question on this matter last week I said, as I had indicated earlier to the House in n general statement, that discharges to be made on the basis referred to would be made on a graduated scale, and that the method of effecting such releases was 'being examined .by the responsible authorities. I have not yet received a report on that aspect of the matter, but so soon as it comes to hand it will be carefully examined. I do not suggest that great difficulties arise in the matter, but the releases must be effected on an orderly plan. When that report has been prepared, I shall advise the House regarding it. </para>

                        <para>- I should imagine that other taxpayers, as well as those mentioned by the right honorable gentleman, might regard the payment of the provisional tax in the year in which the assessment was issued as a hardship ; but I shall examine the matter with the Commissioner of Taxation to see whether anything that would be reasonably equitable can be done with regard to it. I assume. however, that the commissioner himself has ample power to deal with such cases. </para>

                        <para>- I have had this very grave statement ,by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> investigated, and I find it to be quite as unfounded, as was the implication in the question which he asked last week. Two officers of my department visited police head-quarters in Sydney, and their investigations proved the truth in every particular of the statement which I made last week. At the time, the police were able to produce only four guns which, to their knowledge, had ever had any connexion with the Sydney underworld. Later, officers of my department wencalled upon to view two other guns at tinthe Liverpool-street police station. They bore all the Army markings, and were of the type issued by the' Army. The honorable member for Richmond said that it was reported that the police had in their' possession 24 guns. </para>

                            <para>- The police have i" their possession guns which, never had any connexion with the underworld, in Sydney or anywhere else. They were left with the police for safekeeping, some of them being souvenirs of this war, and others of the last war, and their owner? were perfectly entitled to possess them. Included among these are five German guns, one of which was used in the last war. They were souvenirs. There are three trophies from the present war against the Japanese, one American carbine, one Browning machine gun rifle, an Owen gun issued to the Police Department for test purposes, and another Owen gun which was presented to a high official of the department. The rest are American Thompson sub-machine guns of a kind which can be purchased by any civilian in the "United States of America. They were left with the police for safekeeping by people who had a  perfecright  to own them. They are in no way connected with the underworld. I add that the police authorities are greatly disturbed by such extravagant statements, particularly when they emanate from public men. They do not help individual citizens or the country as a whole. </para>

Certain points have been the subject of consultation and I understand, from memory, that agreement has been reached on some but that a few other points are still the subject of discussion. I am not aware of the intention of the British Government regarding the issue of a White Paper, but I sec no reason why, when discussions have been completed, the final arrangements should not be communicated to this House. </para>

He has discussed with me on several occasions the work that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could do. It does appear that what has been done in England in relation to dispersal of fogs in order that aircraft may land at times when otherwise they would be unable to, is associated with the frost problem.

If so, does not the Acting Prime Minister regard this as a very severe stricture upon the methods employed by Professor Copland in the conduct of that inquiry, especially in view of the fact that grave  dissatisfaction  exists amongst many manufacturers and businessmen concerning the methods of the Prices Commission in fixing prices and the limitation of profits which, it is alleged, are illegal? In view of Professor Giblin's report and criticism, will the Acting Prime Minister order an independent inquiry into the whole of the methods of the Prices  Commission? </para>

I also indicated last week that I did not, propose to table Professor Giblin's report, but that I would consider tabling his conclusions. Last Sunday I released his conclusions in a statement to the press. I cannot remem!ber the particular passages to which the honorable member lias referred; I do not know that one could say that the conclusions are inconclusive, but it appears that both sides to the dispute have derived satisfaction from them, and that would appear to indicate a perfect report. So much argument has taken place about this matter that I do not propose to enter the lists. With respect to the latter part of the honorable member's question, I see no reason to arrange a special investigation of the methods of the Prices Commission. The Prices Commissioner was appointed by a previous government and although officers of the commission may have made mistakes, human natura being imperfect, I say frankly that the  Commissioner  and his staff, having regard to all the difficulties confronting them, have done a splendid job for this country. </para>

                        <para>- A dispute in the sugar industry in Victoria has occasioned great inconvenience to domestic users, and, I understand, is causing factories to cease or reduce the production of urgentlyrequired foodstuffs. Has the Acting Prime Minister taken any action to treat this dispute as an emergency, requiring the transport of refined sugar from other States to Victoria? If not, will the honorable gentleman consider such action? Have inquiries revealed that the attitude adopted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, has been endorsedby the appropriate industrial tribunal? If it has, what action is the Government taking for the purpose of ensuring that the men shall work in accordance with the prescribed law? </para>

                    <para> - The possible effects of this dispute were first brought to my notice by the  Chairman  of the Rationing Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> who pointed out that shopkeepers would have difficulty in supplying the quantity of sugar represented by the coupons as they became due. I discussed the matter with the Minister for Trade and Customs, and asked him to obtain a return showing the quantities of raw and refined sugar stored in the various capital cities. Except for a very small quantity in one instance, the excess over the normal requirements of each State was inconsiderable. Consequently, very little could be done in regard to shipping refined sugar from other States to Victoria. The stocks of raw sugar in certain localities are fairly substantial. The industrial aspect has been followed very closely by the Minister for Labour and National Service and myself, but I shall not weary honorable members by recounting the history of the dispute. As to what action the Government proposes to take, the Minister for Labour and National Service arrived in Canberra from Sydney to-day, and I shall discuss the matter with him. this afternoon. </para>

As the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has indicated its willingness to pay the extra amount to the contractor, will the Minister take the matter up with the Prices Commissioner with a view to allowing the increase to be passed on by the contractor and so avoid industrial' trouble? </para>

                    <para>NX67681, Sapper L. J. Pedvin, was employed by the Department of the Interior as a works supervisor. He was continuously in the employ of the department for nine years. With his wife and child he occupied a government house in Canberra, and paid a rent of 32s. 6d. a week. He was in occupation of the dwelling for seven years, during which time the rent was regularly and promptly paid. He was a good tenant, and during1 his absence, his wife also has been a good tenant and has paid her rent regularly, with the exception of a certain amount which is in dispute. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> was served with an eviction notice the amount in dispute was only £23. At the time of Pedvin's enlistment, he was in receipt of approximately £10 a week from the department. He volunteered for war service during the black days of the Dunkirk evacuation. Incidentally,  a9  his department was a protected undertaking, he was not subject to call-up in the usual way. His enlistment was patriotic in the true sense of the word. He entered the Army in January, 1941, on a sapper's pay of 7s. a day, including deferred pay. This, including allotments to his wife and child, brought the total to £4 7s. 6d. a week, which represented a direct monetary sacrifice on enlistment of £5 12s. _ 6d. a week. Pedvin sailed for Malaya- </para>

                            <para>- Pedvin sailed with the ill-fated 8th Division and was taken prisoner when Singapore fell on the 15th February, 1942. He is now, so far as we know, a prisoner in the hands of the Japanese. Prior to the fall of Singapore, he was promoted to the rank of corporal. This fact has great significance in this case, and I shall refer to it later. It is fitting to mention at this stage that the Menzies Government approved of the granting of a rent rebate to tenants of government-owned properties in Canberra who were serving in the fighting forces and whose financial circumstances were such as to warrant a concession. Pedvin applied for the concession and was granted it at the maximum rate of 10s. a week, his rental being reduced from 32s. 6d. to 22s. 6d. The concession was made applicable from the time when he enlisted in the Army. In June, 1942, after the concession had .been operating for eighteen months and after Pedvin had been reported missing, his wife, in order to augment her income, obtained employment in a government office in Canberra. She advised the Department of the Interior of this fact, and the concession was immediately stopped. There is not the slightest complaint about that; <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> concurred in the decision. However, she was advised to reapply for the concession if she ceased work or if her circumstances changed. She continued in employment for about eighteen months, but, owing to ill-health, she decided to relinquish her employment at the end of December, 1943. During the entire period in which she had been in employment she paid her full rent of 32s. 6d. a  week  regularly and without demur or complaint. I emphasize that there is no objection on that account. In January, 1944, being without employment and entirely dependent upon her income from the Army, she  re-applied  for the concessional allowance of 10s. a week. In response to her application, she received  only a bald notification from the Department of the Interior that the concession was refused; no reasons were given. She applied again, with the same result. She then forced the issue by reverting to the payment of rent at the concessional rate of 22s. '6d. a week, which she paid regularly. In the meantime, she strongly, and in view of all the circumstances courageously, resisted the department. Having precipitated a crisis, she received a letter from the secretary to the Minister for the Interior stating that the reason for the refusal to grant the concession was that she was receiving increased allowance because her husband had been promoted from sapper to corporal. That was the only reason ever submitted by the department, and I emphasize the fact in view of the inquiries and Criminal Investigation Branch tactics that, have been loosed upon her. As I shall show, the reason was utterly fallacious. The only increase of income that the woman had received, apart from the period during which she earned money, was- the statutory increase made to all servicemen and their dependants. I .shall now deal with  the  facts relating to the promotion of Pedvin from sapper to corporal. When, in this House on the 28th February, I mentioned the treatment which <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> had received, the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> made allegations concerning income that she was said to be receiving from property in Sydney, despite the fact that on two occasions she had made a sworn declaration in rebuttal, which she had supported by the production of her bank pass book. I understand that she has since produced the books to the parliamentary committee. They show that her income is derived solely from her Army allowance. This has not yet been controverted. If and when the report of the committee is placed before the House, I shall comment further on this aspect of the matter. The statement of the department that her income had increased in consequence of the promotion of her husband, is untrue; because, although Pedvin was promoted, he became a prisoner-of-war almost immediately, and no authority to increase his- allotment has ever appeared in Army records. Consequently, under </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Army regulations, his wife has continued to receive an allowance based on the rate of pay of a sapper. That is the position at the present time. Despite the fact that the rent not in dispute had been paid right up to date, that Pedvin was an employee of the department which owns the dwelling occupied by his wife and child, that he was a prisoner-of-war in the hands of the Japanese, and that the very small sum of £23 was in dispute, an eviction notice, signed by the Minister for the Interior and directed to the soldier himself, although at the time he was a prisoner-of-war in the hands of the Japanese, was served on his wife, instructing her to quit possession of the cottage by the 15th May last. I have a copy of that notice. With rare callousness, it was dated the 14th February, the eve of the third anniversary of the day on which Pedvin became a prisoner-of-war. It was at this point that I raised the matter in this House. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> considered it of such importance that, on the 2nd March, he said that he would appoint a committee, consisting of members of all parties, and would ask a senior Minister to discharge the duties of  chairman  if he were unable to do so personally. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> was appointed  chairman  of the committee. It has had three months in which to determine this simple matter, hut has not yet made a report. The delay is said to he due to the absence in San Francisco of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> a member of the committee. The committee had ample time to finalize the matter long before the honorable member's departure from Australia. Despite the denials of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the dunning of this lady still goes on. 'She has not received one line from the department, stating whether the eviction notice has been withdrawn or will be executed at a later date. Whenever she makes a payment of rent, the receipt issued to her has on it a reminder of her alleged arrears. I shall show to the satisfaction of any fair minded person that those receipts constitute consistent dunning. First, they record that she is in arrears with her rent to the amount in dispute. Secondly, they record the increasing amount of those arrears week by week. I have four of the receipts that have been issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin;</inline> they cover a period of six weeks from the 27th April. Two of the amounts <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> paid personally, and on the other two occasions she left money with a neighbour for payment to the collector. I emphasize the recognition by the department that the form of receipt issued personally to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> inflicted humiliation which should be kept from the knowledge of neighbours. The procedure to which I am about to refer may be regarded as the only consideration which the department has shown to this woman. The form in which the receipts were issued proves that the department recognized the doubtful character of its actions; in other words, that the receipts undoubtedly were dunning documents. The first receipt is dated the 28th April, 1945. The payment was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin,</inline> and the amount recorded is £2 5s., which is stated to be rent to the 18th April. But, so as to remind her that the amount in dispute is neither forgotten nor forgiven, the words " Balance, £28 ", appear at the bottom of the receipt. On the 10th May and the 24th May, the payments were made by a neighbour. In deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin's</inline> feelings, the receipts make no reference to a balance being outstanding. </para>

I again emphasize that this lady is right up to the minute with the payment of what she considers is her proper rent. The receipt issued on that occasion reveals greater refinement of feeling than had been shown previously, because it contains only the inscription " £31", not prefaced by the word " balance ".

                        remissness in the six weeks under review. According to the department, her arrears increased from £28 on the 27th April to £31 on the 7th June. Any intelligent person can construe the form of the receipts only as an implied demand for the payment of the amount said to be in arrears. When the committee was appointed early in March, the disputed arrears amounted to only £25. The Vice-President of the Executive Council may interpret the expression " dunning letters " entirely to his own satisfaction, but that these receipts which I have produced are dunning intimations is beyond dispute. What is more, they are so regarded by the recipient of them. Since the whole of the arrears are the subject of a parliamentary investigation, all reference to them by the department should have been suspended, pending the presentation of the committee's report. In this view I am supported by the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself, because, in the course of his reply to my question on Thursday last, he said, " Until the matter is finally adjusted, it should remain as it was when the committee started its deliberations." I think that I have proved conclusively that the matter has not remained as it was since that time. As a matter of fact, the arrears in that period have increased from £25 to £31. Yet the department says that there has been no dunning of

                    <para>This case has gone far beyond the responsibility of the Minister for the Interior, and. the dispute will not be resolved by making a. scapegoat of the Minister. The responsibility now rests squarely on the Government as a whole. Since the attention of the Parliament has been directed to the case and the Prime Minister has appointed a. committee to investigate it, the matter has been taken out of the hands of that Minister, and the delay on the part of the committee in presenting its report cannot , be excused. No semblance of consideration appears to have been given to the fact that the tenant's ultimate fate caused harrowing anxiety to a soldier's wife. She has been in a constant state of nervous tension ever since the receipt, in February last, of the eviction notice,  which still hangs over her head. If the Government delays action much longer the returned soldiers at Canberra will settle this matter themselves. They have long been prepared to do that. </para>

They are prepared even to buy the house at the Government's valuation, so that the tenant may be no longer molested. A point has now been reached, however, where that principle must be sacrificed, if necessary, in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin's</inline> health. She cannot stand this strain much longer. I therefore urge that the committee should complete its report, and that in the meantime the department, which owns the house, should be instructed that this lady must not be further pestered. </para>

                            <para>- I have read from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof. I repeat the words " dunning letters ", which left no doubt in the minds of honorable members that the department was sending letters to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> in connexion with this matter, and, in fact, harassing her in the process. That is the impression created by the honorable member's remarks. I thought at the time that possibly that was happening, and I said that no such letters should be sent to her. That is how I sincerely felt about the matter. Next day I inquired from the department whether this practice was being followed, and I received a reply to the effect that no letters had been sent by it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin.</inline> I remarked at the time that any employee of the department who gave false information to me on the matter had better put on his coat and hat, because in matters of that kind everything must be clear and above board and truthful statements must be made. It is very clear that letters have not been sent. The honorable member for Richmond ought to be more careful in his statements, because it is common knowledge in the parliamentary lobbies that he is "easy meat", and that " Larry " Anthony can be induced to ask any question in the House, whether it relates to facts or not. That, I think, is a bad reputation for the honorable member to have earned. </para>

                    <para>It is true that whilst receipts tendered to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin</inline> from time to time bore a reminder of the unpaid balance, receipts left with a lady living next door to her bore no reference to balance due. The rent collector did not wish to make any reference on the receipts to the balance unless he was handing them directly to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pedvin.</inline> When she returned to Canberra after having been absent for some time, and a receipt was handed to her, a note was made on the butt, which I now have before me, that the balance due was £31. I have made inquiries and am informed that ordinary business principles are observed in matters of this kind, and that until a proper authority determines whether the outstanding payments are to be made or not, they must be stated in the receipts from time to time. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member cannot get away from the fact that a departmental instruction was issued in 1940, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil</inline> was Minister, to the effect that this practice must be followed, and it has been followed ever since. The Treasury is interested in the matter, because public money is involved. Under Treasury Regulation No. 39, an officer who receives any money  must give a receipt or acknowledgment on a printed form taken from a boole of receipt forms supplied to him for the purpose. The regulations do not prescribe any form of receipt, but it is generally understood that all written receipts should include the date and number of the receipt, the name of the person from whom the amount is received, ;md the amount in words and figures. The regulations also provide that, when part payment of a sum due is made, it is imperative that the officer issuing the receipt shall indicate on it that the n mount has been "received on account". The insertion on the receipt of the amount of the balance due, while not  essential  for the purposes of the receipt, is not an unusual procedure, and does afford protection in the collection of public moneys. That is the instruction which was issued by the Treasury to officers of the Department of the Interior, and those instructions are followed in all such cases. If there are arrears, they are set forth as such. </para>

As a matter of fact, no dunning letters were sent to her. On the days on which she was present the rent collector discussed the matter with her when the receipt was handed over, and she made no mention of anything of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- These rent collectors in the Department of the Interior are themselves returned soldiers. This returned soldier business is only skin deep with the honorable member for Richmond. He started playing politics in the House over .this matter, and has come out of it very :badly indeed. I do not know what the  honorable  member's colleagues think of him, but it is interesting to note that the .two Opposition  members  of the committee which was appointed to inquire into this case have not sought to capitalize the delays which have taken place. They have acted very decently, and have 'been content to wait. They may have thought that the inquiry should have been pursued with greater speed, but I am sure that, if they had been disposed to take any action on that account, they would have como to me, the  chairman  of the committee, and discussed it with me. That is the decent way to do these things, as one member  to another, but the  honorable  member for Richmond seems to have got beyond the point of acting decently. I do not want to prejudice this woman's case. </para>

                            <para>- I believe <inline font-style="italic">C-Q</inline> honorable member for Richmond has prejudiced her case to such a degree that, if her health has been affected, his handling of the matter has certainly not helped. He has been  using  for political purposes the situation in which this unfortunate woman finds herself. I am anxious to see that she is treated justly and decently, and I ask the other members of the committee to say whether that has not been my attitude all through. There is another aspect of this inquiry which I shall not mention, because I do not think that it would be right to do so at this stage. It involves factors which should not be discussed, even in this Parliament, but it makes it necessary that inquiries be pursued in Sydney, and we propose to do that. It may be unfortunate that one member of the committee, the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> is absent at San Francisco. It may be that we should have reached a decision earlier. If so, I shall take the blame. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay,</inline> another member of the committee, has not been able to attend meetings. Members of Parliament have many duties to attend to, and it is sometimes difficult to get them to meetings. As soon as it is possible to complete our inquiries the result will be made known to the House. The honorable member for Richmond said last Thursday that dunning letters had been sent to this lady. It has been proved that nothing of the kind took place. Now, if he desires to do the decent thing, he will get up and apologize. </para>

                        <para>- For obvious reasons, it has not been the custom to disclose the actual stocks of petrol in Australia. I shall discuss this matter with the Minister for Supply and Shipping, and ascertain his views. The cessation of hostilities in Europe and the reduced risk to tankers in areas close to Australia may permit more favorable consideration to be given to requests for increased supplies of petrol to motorists. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to provide £27,000,000 out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. Bills seeking appropriations of this nature are submitted to the Parliament periodically to enable amounts to be paid to a trust account from which the actual payments of pensions are made at rates already approved by the Parliament. The balance of appropriation now remaining is sufficient to meet pension payments to the end of June, and the Parliament is asked to appropriate £27,000,000, which is approximately sufficient for next year's expenditure. The amount will, however, not be withdrawn from revenue immediately, as only sufficient funds are paid to the trust account as are required to meet the periodical payment to pensioners. Thisbill has no relation whatever to the rates or conditions under which invalid and old-age pensions are paid; it merely seeks the provision of funds to enable payments to be made on the basis already approved by the Parliament. </para>

                <para>The purpose of this bill is the appropriation of an additional £20,000,000 of revenue for war purposes. When the budget was presented to Parliament in September last, I estimated that the total revenue would be £359,000,000. A like sum, which included £177,000,000 for war purposes and the balance for other expenditure, was appropriated from revenue. Some revenue items will exceed the budget estimate. Income tax may yield an increased amount of £15,000,000 Sales tax is expected to exceed the estimate by £2,000,000. Customs and excise and post office revenue show a tendency to buoyancy 01'Cr the Estimates and, as other items of revenue show the same trend, the budget estimate may be appreciably exceeded. It is anticipated that non-war expenditure will be approximately the same as the budget estimate. It is diffiCUt at present to forecast accurately the total revenue for the full financial year, but the indications are that the improvement will be from £15,000,000 to £20,000,000. It is necessary that an additional appropriation, whatever the amount may be, should be made to enable the use of that increased revenue to meet war expenditure. Appropriation of £20,000,000 is therefore sought. </para>
                <para>In the budget, I informed the Parliament that war expenditure in 1944-45 would be £505,000,000. Owing to unavoidable delay in the rendition of accounts for heavy overseas liabilities, there has been a substantial falling off of the rate of expenditure, and it is now possible that the expenditure for the year will not exceed £470,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- If those accounts do not come forward we shall naturally have a heavy leeway to make up next financial year. If the improvement of the revenue amounts to £20,000,000, the effect of the proposed appropriation will be to relieve the loan fund and charge to revenue £20,000,000 without increasing our total expenditure. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> probably knows that this surplus revenue must be appropriated. </para>

                <para>The provision made in the bill covers only the estimated requirements to carry on the essential services on the basis of the provision in the Appropriation Act passed by Parliament for the current year 1944-45. The amounts set down for ordinary services represent, with minor exceptions, approximately one quarter of the 1944-45 appropriations. </para>
                <para>Excluding special appropriations, it is estimated that in the first three months of 1945-46 the total war expenditure will amount to £105,102,000. This amount is substantially less than one-quarter of last year's appropriation, due principally to the reduction in expenditure in England and America, to the lag in expenditure in the first quarter of the financial year, and to some extent to a falling off in war expenditure in Australia. The sum of £40,000,000 provided for war services in this bill represents the estimated amount which will be available from revenue receipts for the first three months of the year to meet war expenditure after making due allowance for other obligations. The balance of war expenditure will be met from loan appropriations. </para>
                <para>As in previous years, provision is made in the bill for "Advance to the Treasurer", the amount being £5,000,000. This amount is required mainly to carry on uncompleted civil works which will be in progress at the 30th June, and also to cover unforeseen and miscellaneous expenditure. No provision has been made for any new expenditure except in respect of Defence and war services, and there is no departure from existing policy. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The reason for my amendment must be obvious to the committee. Under the measure, various departments of the bank are to be set up, including the central bank, an extension of the central bank into trading bank activity, the Note Issue Department, the Industrial Finance Department, the Rural Credits Department, and the Housing Department. Under the measure the whole of the control and management of those departments is to be in the hands of the Governor, who will be subject, of course, to political direction by the Treasurer and the Government of the day. Consequently, having regard to the fact that the Bank Board which has stood the test of time is to go out of existence, and the Government will not accept in its place an advisory body consisting of persons who are or have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry, the alternative is to provide a Note Issue Department with separate management, but with the necessary co-operation and co-ordination in matters of policy with other departments of the bank. Indeed, this provision should be made in respect of all departments of the bank. Even in a departmental store, managers are provided in each department and they confer and act under the direct control of the general manager, who, in turn, is under the control and direction of a board of directors. If that method is good enough for the successful and competent management of commerce and industry, it should be an essential requirement for the management, control and co-ordination of the basis of the whole of our financial structure, namely, the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                    <para>. -  The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> will not achieve the form of management that the right honoralble gentleman would like best but represents a kind of middle course. The existing law provides that the note issue shall he controlled by the Commonwealth Bank Board. The bill provides that the note issue shall be controlled by the governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and, therefore, be under the control of the Treasurer. With his amendment, the right honorable gentleman is seeking to recover something from the wreck by providing that, at least, the note issue shall have separate management from the other activities of the bank, the idea being that the note issue is of such far-reaching importance that it should be divorced as far as possible from immediate political control. It is quite true that in the long run, the note issue of a country - particularly a country under parliamentary government - is subject to political control, because the Parliament may always pass special legislation in relation to it. But there is very great force in the view, which was argued during the second-reading debate on this bill, that to put the note issue under the direct control of the Treasury is to invite, in some circumstances and under some treasurers, a disastrous handling of the note issue. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In his second-reading speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said that the note issue was only a reflection of credit policy, and, therefore, he rather deprecated any suggestion that the note issue, of itself, was a very significant matter. He looked at the note issue as the result of certain causes, and not as a cause in itself. In the event of inflation, he would look to central bank policy as the major cause, and would look upon an inflated note issue merely as a result of what had been done by the central bank. Similarly, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> in addressing himself to this matter <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 803) said - </para>

                    <para>The a mount of the note issue is a matter of minor importance when considering the stability of the currency. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I desire to say a few words about those points. It would, I think, be a great mistake if anybody gained the idea that the increase of the note issue from about £40,000,000 to about £200,000,000 is a matter of no great significance. It is quite true that in many respects, the note issue does reflect central bank policy and, in particular, that aspect of central bank policy which concerns itself with the lending of money to the Government. If the central hank decides to advance very large sums of money to the Government, on treasury-bills, for example, the amount of money that will go into circulation will immediately be increased, and according to the velocity of its circulation, the demand for currency will be increased in the community. Quite normally, in times like these, when large sums of money are being made available to the Government by the central bank, we expect to find an increase of the note issue. But that ignores, or gives insufficient weight to, two considerations. The first of them is that, just because we cannot expand central bank credit greatly without expanding the note issue, it follows that if we cannot maintain some limit upon the note issue, we have to put a limit on the effective use that we can make of central bank credit. Let us suppose that in Australia we had had, at material times, some upward ceiling for the note issue, adopting one portion of the proposal discussed at one stage by Lord Keynes, to which I referred in my second-reading speech. Let us suppose also that the ceiling on the note issue had been £100,000,000. That being the limit to the amount of currency which could go into circulation, it would have some damping effect upon the use of central bank credit and the availability of central bank lending to the Central Government. That factor, though not of enormous consequence, should not be overlooked. </para>
                <para>The second factor is certainly not to be overlooked. Currency inflation can, of itself, be used, irrespective of general central bank policy. For example, the central bank might be pursuing a policy which would result in a stable currency, and the Treasurer of the day, given command over the note issue, as he is under this legislation through the person of the Governor, might very easily say, " Very well, I shall finance a new social service by printing notes. I shall use the note issue as the direct originating means for bringing about this new expenditure ". That increase of the note issue would be utterly unrelated to the supply of commodities, the demand for commodities, and any ordinary economic indices which determine sound central bank policy. It would have a purely political cause, and might produce, in one hit, an inflation of the note issue by £20,000,000 or £30,000,000. In those circumstances, the currency inflation would be the direct result of a direct control over the note issue itself. I emphasize that point, although it, is, no doubt, a truism to those who have given thought to these problems, because it would be a blunder to accept this rather comfortable notion that the amount of the note issue is the mere reflection of credit policy, when, as a matter of fact, it may, under the terms of this bill, have nothing to do with credit policy at all, but have everything to do with a direct inflation of the currency for some political purpose. </para>
                <para class="block">Because I believe that, my own view - I have expressed it before, and I do not desire to repeat it - is that the control of the note issue by the board is theproper kind of control. After all, we began by having Treasury control of the note issue; then we had control by a Not&amp;s Board; and we then had control by the Bank Board itself. Wherever we have control by a board, with the board's corporate responsibility and variety of experience, we have a much greater safeguard over our currency than we have if the matter is left to the fluctuating politics of the moment. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Australian Countryparty, I have reason to believe, agrees with that broad thesis. But that broad thesis has been rejected by the Government, because it has abolished the Bank Board. Now, the right honorable gentleman seeks to do the next best thing, namely, to provide that, at any rate, the note issue, which is so important and far-reaching in character, should, in its management, be divorced- from other aspects of the bank's activities. For those reasons, and to that extent, I support the amendment. </para>

In his presidential address - "German currency: Its collapse and recovery, 1920-1926 " - to the Royal Statistical Society on the 16th November, 19'26, Lord d'Abernon  said that the main cause of inflation in Germany was the ill-regulated issue of notes by the central bank. Lord  d'Abernon  was the United Kingdom ambassador in Germany from after the cessation of hostilities in the last war until approximately 1926. He was in Germany for the entire period of inflation and was able to study events with the eyes and wisdom tff a man who had a high reputation in his own country as a great economist. The German economists, professors and other learned gentlemen of those days said that the amount of internal currency in circulation had little influence on its external value. The latter was determined, so they contended, mainly by the passivity or activity of the trade balance. On the 7th August, 1923, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Havenstein,  then president of the Reichsbank, speaking before the  Reichsrat  said - </para>

                <para class="block">The effect of that, of course, was that internal price levels in Germany rose so fast that they were changed hourly. I can quite understand the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> and other Government members, insisting that these things cannot happen in this country, but to a government which encounters embarrassing financial problems the uncontrolled issue of notes can be a very tempting way to get out of its immediate difficulties. As with a man who seeks solace in drink or opium, once a start has been made on the slippery slide, recovery is most difficult.  For that reason it is vital that the note issue should have a limit, and should be controlled by an independent authority, as under the existing Commonwealth Bank legislation. But I cannot see any great advantage in placing control of the note issue in the hands of a separate department, when it is truly a central bank function, and I cannot understand why the Treasurer himself, in this legislation, has departed from our recommendation in dissenting from the report of the royal commission. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment, although I am not optimistic that even if carried, it will reduce greatly the dangers inherent in having the note issue completely in the hands of the Treasurer. What seems to me to be an absurdity is this: Running right through the legislation like a crimson thread, is the effect of clause 9, and no matter what safeguards we may seek to impose in this part of the legislation, or in any other part, that clause !) will nullify our efforts. Treasury control of the note issue can be a great danger, quite apart from the possibility of inflation. The psychological factor must be considered. I deny that the note issue is always a direct result or consequence of central bank policy being carried out from time to time, but even if that were true the effect of a large amount of notes upon the market can, from a psychological point of view, be to depreciate the value of the currency. This legislation does two things: First, it removes the sterling reserve for the note issue, and to that  degree it eliminates completely all safeguards on the amount of the note issue from time to time. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Secondly, clause 9 enables any portion of the bank s policy in any of its departments, to he determined by the Treasurer. No one can deny that in this country at present, as in most countries at war, there are very dangerous elements which can lead to inflation. During the war we have been able to control inflation very largely by our controls, particularly over manpower, wages and prices, but when the war ends control of man-power will be relaxed, as has been indicated by the Government's White Paper on full employment and wages will prove incapable of being pegged indefinitely. As to control of prices, I think that honorable members will concede that a continuance of existing measures will not be possible, nor do J think it desirable that they should be continued permanently. That points to the danger which we shall face when the war ends. The quantity of notes issued at any time may be of no more consequence, or oven of less consequence, as an element of inflation, than the amount of bank deposits. During the war, savings bank deposits have increased by well over £200,000,000, trading bank deposits by a similar amount, the note issue by about £150,000,000, and treasury-bills have advanced from a total of £50,000,000 to over £200,000,000. These are dangerous factors, which can lead to inflation. One of the most dangerous factors to be considered is the psychological effect of the note issue being subject to the vagaries of government policy. In my opinion, inflation springs not only from economic factors but also from psychological factors, and the most important psychological factor is the amount of notes current in the community. We ought to apply some brake to the issuing of notes, and therefore I support the amendment. The Government would not be in any way prejudiced, if the amendment were accepted, because clause 9 gives the Government overriding control in the event of any disagreement with the bank. The amendment at least provides for separate management of the note issue, so that the special factors related to increasing the note issue would bo considered by a body of men specially appointed for the purpose. I urge the Government to accept the amendment, which will in no way affect the main purpose of the bill. </para>

                <para class="block">As the bill stands, there is no provision for any restriction on the issuing of notes. In this connexion, it is interesting to read the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, of which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> was a member. In paragraph 579, the commission summed up the position as follows: </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The present position is that the Commonwealth Bank is compelled by law to hold in the form of gold or English sterling a reserve of 25 per cent, of the notes issued. If an emergency arises, as in 1931, in which the Bank wishes to be free from this restriction, legislation is required. Wherever there is a legal restriction of this kind there is a tendency to hold a reserve in excess of the legal minimum. In the absence of such, restriction, the Bank would be able to use these reserves in any way it chose. Formerly, when the holder of a note was entitled to exchange it for gold, it was necessary that some gold " bucking " for the notes should be kept, and it was customary to limit the amount of the note issue by reference to the gold held. Now, however, that the note carries with it no such obligation, there is no need for such "backing" except as a method of limiting the volume of notes. But for this purpose the reserve limitation, as at present interpreted, is of little use. For if the Bank wishes to increase the volume of the note issue, it can. by raising the exchange rate, increase the value in Australian currency of the note issue reserve, whilst keeping within the legal limits. On the other hand, the reserve limitation may cause embarrassment to the Bank if circumstances arise in which it wishes to reduce the exchange rate. It is desirable that some limit should be placed on the note issue, but the issue should be capable of some expansion when necessary. </para>

                    <para>.- ^Clause 41 is the crucial clause of this -division of the bill. Judging by the experience of other nations, it appears to be essential that, if this legislation is to operate in peace.time as well as in times of national emergency, such as the present state of war, there must be some method of controlling the total issue of notes. An investigation of the laws of other countries shows that there are two main methods of applying such control. One is the establishment of a proportional reserve, against which notes can be issued to a specified number of times the value' of the gold or international exchange backing. The other is the imposition of a maximum limit ou the fiduciary issue, in addition to having a fully covered issue, as is the case with the Bank of England. I notice that there is a very interesting provision common to the laws of most countries, namely that when notes are issued in excess of the legal backing, a tax in respect of that excess is paid by the issuing .bank. A good example of this is the United. States Federal Reserve Act, under which the tax is 1 per cent, per annum if the proportion of gold reserve is between 40 per cent, and 32£ per cent., and  14  per cent, per annum for each. <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent, or part thereof] by which the reserve falls below 32^ per cent. Most of the acts of the different countries provide for increasing taxes in similar steps, and nearly all of them have the provision in the Federal Reserve Act that the tax or a proportion of it must be added to the rate of discount. The effect of this would be that, as inflation occurred, there would be some measure of control, by reason of the tendency of interest rates to increase throughout the whole of the banking system, because discount rates had risen. It is obvious that there must be proper control of the note issue if the Government's stated policy of having low-interest rates is to be given effect. I shall place on record the methods of issue in most countries; because it is worthwhile to remember that we must expect to get our migrants from those countries; and we shall not have a large number of migrants bringing to Australia big sums for investment unless they are assured that our banking system will contain real safeguards at the end of the war. In their existing legislation there is provision for a maximum note issue in England, Finland, Japan, Norway, Spain  and Sweden. There is a statutory proportional reserve in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, United, States of America, and Yugoslavia. I emphasize the inclusion of Russia in that list of countries, because, although the Government does not always seem anxious to " lie in the same bed " as that country, it has adopted many of the Russian policies. There is provision in some countries for a tax if the reserve falls. </para>

                        <para>- The bank discount rate automatically rises, and with that rise there is an increase of the interest rates generally throughout the country. That has been found to be one of the best means of resisting inflation. Those countries are: Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Norway, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States of America. In many of them there is provision for the raising of interest rates as the note issue increases. Let us consider the example of England, which we might well follow whilst doing away with the present system. English legislation provides a definite safeguard against permanent inflation. According to the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, the Bank of England may issue notes up to the amount representing the gold, coin and bullion in the Issue Department, plus notes amounting to £260,000,000 in excess of the gold holding - a fiduciary issue. At the request of the bank, the Treasury may authorize an issue of bank notes in excess of the £260,000,000 for a period not exceeding six months. Any such authority may bs renewed or varied, but no such authority shall remain in force for two years unless the Parliament otherwise determines. The Treasury minute authorizing an increase of the fiduciary note issue must be laid before both Houses of the Parliament forthwith. We have been striving to secure the acceptance of that principle of responsibility to Parliament in connexion with every vital matter of policy throughout the consideration of this measure. The Government would be well advised to consider very cardfuly the insertion, if not here then in the Senate, of a provision of that sort, which the experience of practically all civilized countries has shown to be necessary if there is to be confidence in the financial structure. The matter should be viewed realistically. Inflation is merely a form of concealed tax, especially on the poorest section of the community. It does not contribute to the general fund of the Government out of which the cost of public works and services is defrayed. The tax of inflation, although invisible, is none the less real, and it does not benefit anybody in the community, except the few who are able to make fortunes by taking advantage of it. Even for the protection of the Treasury, a provision in this legislation making reference to the Parliament necessary would be a wise course to adopt. </para>

                <para>In a time of war, practically all laws go by the board. But we do not always have a temperature of 104 or 105 degrees, such as accompanies a bad attack of pneumonia, when clear mental decisions are not. possible. We should not base legislation on war-time experience, but should follow the practice almost universally adopted. I assume that the Government, having brought to this Parliament the Bretton Woods Agreement, will take steps to implement it. The amount of international exchange that will be available to us from the pool formed under that agreement will depend upon the reserve that we have against our note issue. It would be inconsistent were we to agree that we should have a reserve as a member of this international monetary organization, but not for our domestic purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - A deliberative assembly - which, of course, this is not - would not in any circumstances give to the Treasurer the power to issue notes to an unlimited value, thus vitally affecting the national economy. We have been told repeatedly that the difference between Australia and a fascist country is that this country, being a democracy, has a Parliament that is vested with complete power. Yet this supreme institution in a democracy is being asked to delegate its power to a Government! The proposal is that we should, not only abolish all controls connected with finance, but also give to the Treasurer a blank cheque, by the use of which he might ultimately ruin the whole of our financial structure. Surely adequate control of the issue of notes is vital to the national economy ! An uncontrolled note issue could destroy the value of the currency. The purchasing power of the people, and the value of the wages of working men, the return from investments, and every pension payable, could be immeasurably affected by injudicious action. The inflation of the currency could result in ruin comparable with that which has been experienced by countries on the continent of Europe. This is far too big an issue for any Government to handle alone. As the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has argued, the bill should make such provision as will safeguard not only the people but also the Treasurer himself. The matter is one for determination by the highest authority, the Parliament of the country. After all, the Government represents only a section of the total population. The Parliament should be the supreme authority- to authorize what amount of notes shall be issued. For these reasons, I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I draw the attention of the people to what is being done in this Parliament by legislation of this character. It is idle, however, to hope that the Government will accept any amendment; the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has -made abundantly clear that he will not do so. The honorable gentleman, in his second-reading speech, claimed to have the support of Lord Keynes for his proposal not to tie the note Issue to a specified reserve. That is true. But he did not tell the whole story, because Lord Keynes made it clear that the most satisfactory method for maintaining control of the central bank is to require from time to time legislative approval of the note issue. What has disturbed me most has been the continued decline of the purchasing power of the £1. That has been the trend for the last 25 years particularly, and it will continue. Whilst the impact of war is further diminishing the value of the £1, the policy of governments can increase that tendency. Therefore, it is important at all times to assert the authority of Parliament over the action of the Executive. To-day the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> submitted certain proposed appropriations, the debate upon  which has been postponed, so we shall have an opportunity later of speaking on matters affecting public expenditure. Why, however, is it regarded as  les3  important to debate whether or not a large increase of the note issue is desirable? No opportunity is to be afforded under this bill to debate that vital issue in Parliament. During the war the value of the £1 has fallen, according to official figures, by over 20 per cent.; in my opinion the real reduction of purchasing power is considerably more. When the war controls are lifted, it will be revealed that the reduction has been much greater, and the effect will be serious on member* of the community who have been thrifty and have invested money in liquid assets, particularly those who for many years have paid premiums regularly to life assurance societies. Those who have invested in life assurance during the last five years will receive, in real money, much less than they had expected to get. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to all who have invested in liquid assets in any form. The diminution of the value of the £1 as a result of government policy, means the imposition of a fiat tax on all who hold liquid assets. As the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> remarked, the tax is indirect, and people do not become aware of its effect until they wish to use their money. In the price-fixing policy of the Government, we have seen the " profits squeeze " being used as a means of taxing industry. In this bill . we have another example of action by the Executive in a matter the' decision of which should be the sole prerogative of the Parliament. As the Parliament substantially has surrendered its power in respect of expenditure, it is now surrendering, it in respect of taxation. I cannot see why any government should not be content to have an upper limit of 20 per cent, above i lie present issue of notes, beyond which it should not be permitted to go without parliamentary approval. If Parliament has any real rights, why should not its permission be necessary before the note i:sue could be increased to a greater extent than 20 per cent.? </para>

                        <para>- The sterling reserves conditioned the amount of notes which could be issued. I agree that there should be no tied limit to any specific reserve, but debate of an increase of the note issue is as important as debate of an increase of taxation. Both have the same effect. Indeed, in their , economic consequences, they are very largely the same. </para>

                        <para>- But before we borrow, we have to obtain parliamentary approval. Whether taxation be imposed bv means of a profits squeeze, or by central bank control which affects the purchasing power of the £1, those are both matters which should be debated in this Parliament. I realize that I am as one crying in the wilderness, because the Government intends to go ahead with its policy, irrespective of any views advanced by the Opposition. I urge the Treasurer that there should be an upper limit of 20 or 25 per cent., beyond which the Government should be unable to increase the note issue without parliamentary authority. If that is not provided, one can only infer that the Government does not propose to use its powers exclusively in the interests of sound finance. Serious consideration should be given to my suggestion before the bill reaches the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> made a significant interjection when, referring to the agreement reached at Bretton Woods, he said that it was necessary to put something in before we could get anything out. So far as the note issue is concerned, after the passage of this bill it will not be necessary to put anything in before we can take out as much as we like in the form of paper currency. There will be no limit to what the Government can do in the issue of paper money once this bill becomes law. Last week I referred to the fact that gold had reached a record price. I notice that according to the press the price has risen over the week-end to another record and is now £10 15s. 9d. per oz. In other words, the price of  a  sovereign at the Commonwealth Bank to-day is £2 10s. I have heard, since this Parliament rose on Friday last, that one could obtain £5 for a sovereign on the black market. I have never been to the black market, but I am told that, provided that one can produce the money demanded, and can speak the right language, one can purchase almost anything on the black market at King's Cross, Sydney. </para>

                <para>The ultimate measure of the currency will be gold. That has always been the position, and it will continue to be so. The test will come in future when the Treasury will be asked to relax the present restrictions on the sale of gold. The balance between paper currency and gold prices will be determined by a free market. When that time comes we shall witness a continual increase of the prices of commodities as compared with the value of paper currency. If the Government forces this legislation through the Parliament, as no doubt it will, it will have to carry the responsibility which goes with legislation of this kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I had hoped, though not confidently, that the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> might have had something to say on this matter. After all, there are two things to be done about clauses in a bill of this nature; one is to hear some criticism of them, and the other is to hear some justification of them. In this case we have heard no justification whatever. If ever a set of proposals has been thrown at the Parliament with accompanying observation that no amendments will be received, that has happened with this bill. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister finds his reply either cogent or relevant I cannot share his view. I thought that it was a very adroit speech, but its outstanding feature was that it did not answer anybody or anything. There are three broad principles which can be ap- plied in relation to the matter of the imitation of the note issue. We may decide to go on with the system that we have had - that of having a reserve which has been made flexible enough because it is represented by either gold or sterling. The advantage of that system is that it recognizes one of the basic facts of a nation's finance, and that is that in the long run an international debt or obligation must be met in either goods or gold, or some currency which has international value. Accordingly the existence of a reserve of gold or of English sterling at all times is of importance to Australia, so long as it engages in international transactions. That is one way of doing it. The second way is that indicated in the amendment, namely, to fix an upper limit, not a narrow upper limit, but one that allows for some proper adjustment, with a provision that parliamentary authority must first be obtained to exceed the limit. The Government rejects that method. It does not say why. Not one reason has been given why it is thought to be a good thing that the Executive uncontrolled by either discussion, or decision, in Parliament should have the right to increase the note issue at will and without limit. The third course is, apparently, the course which commends itself to the Government; and that is to have no upper limit and no provision for reserve - in other words, to have a note issue which is uncontrolled except by the mere whim of the Executive. I put this to the Treasurer as a matter which deserves his serious consideration. Is there any reason to believe that the provision which exists to-day for a 25 per cent, reserve of gold, or of sterling, has handicapped us during the war? </para>

                        <para>- I do not want some hypothesis. All I am asking for - and I know that even with the best intentions in the world, the Treasurer will not give it to me - is some evidence that this requirement of reserve has imposed some hardship, some limitation, some awkward consequence upon Australia in financing its war effort. If it has, this Parliamenthas never been told about it. Not once from the day war broke out until now has the Government ever come to Parliament and said, " Alter this 25 per cent. We find it a handicap ". Of course, the truth is that at all material times, and particularly in recent years, our sterling position in London has been pretty good, and sometimes uncommonly good; and the result is that this limitation imposed by a reserve has rested quite lightly upon the Treasury. Why is it to be removed ? Is it because the Treasurer wants to reduce the note issue? Of course not; because if he does want to reduce the note issue there is no point in striking off any of the existing light shackles. Or is it because the Treasurer wants to increase the note issue? If he contemplates increasing the note issue at a time when war expenditure is falling, then we are approaching a period when, instead of full employment prevailing in Australia, a condition of full disaster will obtain. There may be plenty of work  to do, but the real standard of living will not rise, and the real value of. the wages people receive for their work will not be maintained. However, I repeat the one point which I rose to emphasize. Will the Treasurer show us why at this stage it is thought necessary to get rid of a reserve provision ? I have circulated an amendment, a new clause; and I do not desire to speak on it again. There are two ways of imposing control. I shall be quite content with either. I am quite happy with the way proposed by the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> ; or I shall be quite happy with a continuance of the present reserve provision which I have foreshadowed in a new clause. But I am completely unhappy that there shall be no restriction, no condition whatever, no parliamentary control, but utterly uncircumscribed executive control over the amount of currency which may at any moment be put into circulation. </para>

                        <para>- No. The position, as the right honorable gentleman has said, is that the reserve is 25 per cent. of the note issue. Speaking from memory, the note issue rose to £196,000,000. Merely because we were able to acquire London funds, and so long as we had plenty of London funds, we could increase the note issue. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have never regarded the note issue, and I do not regard it now, as being anything more than the financial result of some happening, such as an expansion of credit. Because of great commercial activity there has been a demand for an increase of the note issue, and that demand has simply been met by the bank. Therefore, it is not a matter of the Government coming into the picture at all. The bank has met the demand for notes. It is apparent to anybody who has studied the matter at all that the increase of the note issue has been the result of some cause. </para>

                        <para>- The fact is that the increase of the note issue at present has not been due to anything but a demand for notes following increased commercial activity. Therefore, it is only an effect, not a cause. Let us see what a sham the note issue reserve can be. It is generally conceded that we do not have to hold £25 in sterling against every £100 of Australian notes on issue. All we have to hold in sterling is the equivalent of 25 per cent. of the Australian note circulalation. Whenever the currency is depreciated, as it was by the raising of the exchange rate, more notes can be issued on the basis of the same sterling reserve. If the exchange rate is lowered, less note currency can be issued. </para>

                        <para>- Having regard to some of the wild, irresponsible statements which the right honorable gentleman himself made when an earlier Labour government proposed to send abroad a portion of the gold reserve, I can imagine the sort of statements that would be made in this Parliament in any debate on a subject of this kind. I said the other night, and I repeat, that the more silently and smoothly the financial machine is working the more satisfactory it is, and fewer fears are created in the mind of the community. But, unfortunately, the public takes notice of irresponsible statements, or statements made without full knowledge of the subjectand without regard to the fact that they might create fears in the public mind ; and that has been the case with respect to this measure. </para>

                <para> - Since this measure was introduced, all sorts of statements have been made about the great dangers arising under it. However, we have had a fair instance of the worthlessness of such talk. Since the Government announced its banking proposals, it has floated a loan in which all honorable members assisted. In such circumstances, could they frankly and conscientiously have gone to the country and advised the people to invest in that loan, if they thought that all these fears were going to be realized ? They could not have honestly done that; and that is the blunt fact. I repeat that in every discussion on finance in this chamber statements are made which create fears in the minds of the public. </para>

                        <para>- What I do say is this: Surely, honorable members would not advise the people to invest in war loans if they really believed that all the dangers of which they have spoken were going to arise. I realize that the financial machine can be used badly. There is no doubt about that. Indeed, it has been used badly in the past in order to deflate the currency. In reply to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> it is true that the Commonwealth Bank's sterling reserve in London was in danger of running very low. In 1939 it dropped to £33,000,000, and at that level would not have been sufficient finally to have provided the necessary reserve to the note issue. </para>

                        <para>- But not ample to enable us to meet other commitments. At one time it looked as though our sterling reserve would drop to a dangerous level. The honorable member for Warringah spoke about the necessity for having sufficient reserves in London. If we had not adequate reserves what should we be obliged to do? If the note issue reserve were the only money we had available in sterling, we should have to introduce a measure to wipe out the 25 per cent. provision? And if we reached the position where the note reserve was high we should have a great amount of London funds immobilized behind the note issue, which we could not use without enacting a special measure for that purpose; and by enacting such a measure we should only create fears in the minds of the people and attract the attention of. the world to the fact that we were in difficulty, whereas we could probably overcome our difficulty by handling the matter quietly. </para>

                    <para>.- I take strong exception to the statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)'</inline> before the dinner adjournment that because we on this side support Commonwealth war loans we thereby admit that there  i3  no danger in the Government's banking legislation. He might as well say that no soldier who is fighting should take any exception to what is done by the Government because his action in righting means that he supports whatever is done. When a country is at war every true patriot is prepared to do his best, even though he may not agree with the Administration. He will not stop from resisting an enemy because he believes that in some respects the Government has acted foolishly. We are justified in pointing to the dangers of this legislation, and in assuring the people that it will be changed at the (first opportunity. I take exception to the remarks of the Treasurer because my record during the war shows conclusively that I have been prepared to assist the Government, regardless of what I have thought of some of its legislation. For nearly a year I represented the Commonwealth Government in London, and since I returned to Australia I have continued to assist it. I suggested a stabilization scheme the greater part of which the Government ultimately accepted, and I have sat on the Advisory War Council at the 'invitation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> The speech of the Treasurer to-night is the first that I have heard that my acceptance of these opportunities to  Tender  public service means that I must condone whatever action the Government takes. I am astonished that the Minister should think that safeguards which other countries have embodied, -in their banking legislation in order to protect the note issue are a sham. He would appear to be the. only man occupying a responsible position who holds that view. This afternoon I gave a list of countries which had provided the safeguards that I advocated. No one can say that there was anything in my speech but constructive attempts to improve the bill. I showed how in other countries limits had been placed on the note issue by the Parliament, that various safeguards bad been provided and that there had been an increased discount rate on any excess note issue. The Treasurer said that 1 spoke in an irresponsible way sixteen years ago, but events have shown that what I said then was correct. This bill will affect the lives of every person in the community. Although supporters of the Government have little to say regarding the bill, they describe constructive suggestions from this side as so much sham. I remind the committee that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> was Treasurer he introduced  a  Central Reserve Bank Bill which provided for a reserve to be placed on the note issue. The record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that he insisted on having a reserve of gold or sterling, if only for psychological reasons. To-day the Acting Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer, says that a provision that the people should be told of any extraordinary increase of the note issue would undermine public confidence in the Commonwealth Bank. In Great Britain Parliament has provided that the volume of the note issue shall not be altered without the consent of Parliament. That is the view Qf a country which financed about twenty Allied governments during the war. In Great Britain any proposed increase of the fiduciary note issue must be laid before both Houses of Parliament forthwith. The remarks of the Acting Prime Minister can be interpreted only to mean that Australians are cowardly people who cannot face the truth. That is contrary to our experience. Honorable members know that when the people of Australia realize that there is a real obstacle to overcome, or danger to face, they face it bravely as true Britishers; and generally they overcome it. The difficulty confronting us cannot be met by attempts to sidestep it, or by the making of adroit speeches, or by deciding to handle it silently and secretly. As I pointed out earlier, harmful germs which destroy the human body work silently and secretly. All that we on this side ask is that our well-reasoned arguments shall be given due consideration. Government supporters seem to take no notice at all of the views expressed by honorable members on this side, but that is not the way to get the best legislation. It is well that we should recall the attitude of honorable members now on the Government benches during the years of the depression. I remember well that when the depression came, following a tremendous drop in the prices of wool, butter, wheat and other primary products, the then Labour government took more and more money out of the pockets of the workers by imposing the highest taxation that Australia had known up to that date. It brought about a measure of deflation by restricting the importation of goods from overseas which, had they been allowed to come in, would have increased the incomes of the people generally. Things got so had that every four minutes another worker was thrown out of a job. That was the direct result of the policy of the Government of the day. The then Opposition was able to check some of the Government's proposals, as, for instance, the imposition of an export duty on sheepskins. </para>

                        <para>- This clause says, in effect, that the Government itself, shall control the volume of the note issue. It will not be left to the experts, or even to the Parliament. It is for that reason that I ask honorable members to recall what took place during the regime of a previous Labour government. Because of the constant changes which take place in the political sphere, it may be that in the event of another depression public opinion will force a reduction of the note issue when experts advise that it should be maintained in order to provide employment. In this legislation the Government is wielding a two-edged sword. I urge it to place in the bill provisions which will ensure that the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives in the Parliament, shall prevail. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> explains with over-simplification all banking problems in his pamphlet on finance. I am not offering a solution; I am simply stating the facts of history and attempting to draw some deductions about what will happen here if economic laws are not observed. In the age after the discovery of America by Columbus, Europe began to be faced with a metallic inflation. Prices rose sharply and prosperity came to the people. Throughout history, when the amount of currency, either credit or the note issue, has increased greatly, prices have risen swiftly. If the process is continued indefinitely without limit to the number of notes printed, we reach the position wherein the monetary unit has no command over goods and prices soar to the skies. All that the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> is seeking in his amendment is some check on the unlimited inflation that could take place under this legislation. The Treasurer reiterated that the note issue was only an effect from other causes. That may be so to a limited degree, hut, as a matter of fact, the excess note issue was the direct cause of the inflationary conditions in Germany and other European countries after the last war when the monetary units of certain European countries were smashed. All the precautions, if one can so describe them, in this bill and the Banking Bill to prevent inflation will be useless without the precaution sought in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party. As Lord D'Abernon writes, if the fundamental error exists none of the correctives will have any effect. Though our voices may be ineffective, we are particularly concerned in asking that the Government protect the currency against the possibility of Australia's utter ruin. We are speaking, to a larger audience than the Government benches. We are speaking to the people of Australia in the hope of implanting in their minds the will to make it clear to the Government that they will not stand for the depreciation of the value of the currency that is possible from the unrestricted note issue envisaged by this clause. I was astonished to hear the Treasurer state to-night that the currency of Australia had been depreciated by the pegging of the exchange rate at £130 to £100 sterling, at first, and, later, at £125 to £100 sterling. He spoke as if it had been a bad thing. So did the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Breen).</inline> But the Treasurer spoke as if something terrible had happened. So I refer honorable members to paragraph 551 of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, to which, not eight years ago, in July, 1937, the Treasurer was a signatory </para>

                <para>The movement in the exchange rate in January, 1931, was one of the major contributions of monetary policy to recovery in Australia. </para>
                <para class="block">The honorable gentleman subscribed to that and the following sentences in the report : -  lt increased the returns to exporters in terms of Australian currency which tended to increase the volume of export productions, and it tended to restrict imports. Had the movement come earlier the fall in the national income would have been less, and the task of recovery easier. </para>
                <para class="block">The depreciation of the Australian £1 in terms of sterling stopped the rapid appreciation of the currency and fall of prices that were causing disastrous unemployment. I am, therefore, astonished that honorable gentlemen opposite should talk about a wrong having been done to this country by raising the exchange rate. A racehorse which showed such a reversal of form as the Treasurer has shown would be the subject of an inquiry by the stewards into his form. The member of the royal commission, who, in 1937, ran a dead-heat with its other members straightly, truly and determinedly in saying that there should be a limit on the note issue seems now to have been "got at" by some insidious influences in caucus, deliberate in their intention that at some time the Australian currency shall be smashed to pieces. I do not believe that the Minister assisting the Treasurer is responsible for his reversal of form. I hope that members of the Government are big enough, strong enough and brave enough to flout caucus and think only in terms of the financial security of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  A good deal has been said on this clause about the currency, but one of the most important aspects has been overlooked. In my opinion, a note issued by the 'Commonwealth Bank is in the same category as any other paper money issued by the Commonwealth Government - a debt due by the Commonwealth Government, through one of its instrumentalities, to the person or corporation for the time being in possession of it. </para>

That is the important point. If the Executive proposes to borrow money or raise money by taxes, it must ask the Parliament for the right to do so; but, once this bill is law, there will be no obligation on the Government to ask Parliament for the right to increase the note issue.

Every one knows what he is handling when he handles gold, but when he gets token money - silver, bronze or paper - the position is entirely the opposite. This clause enables the Commonwealth Bank to create as much paper currency as it likes. The history of the world, not ancient but modern history, the history of the period between the two world wars, shows that wherever this authority has been issued it has ended in disaster followed by complete reconstruction of the currency of the country concerned. Any honorable member who has studied the affairs of countries like Greece, Italy, France and Germany after the last war must realize the disaster that overtook them because there was no legislative control whatever of the limits of the note issue. Consequently, a state of affairs occurred which is best illustrated by what took place in Germany, where, after the note issue had been inflated to the stage at which it took about a barrow-load of notes to buy a loaf of bread, the political leaders and financiers of the country got together and devised the Reichsmark, which was backed by a 5 per cent. tax on land values and by the big industries on a ratio of 50 : 50. I raise this because I want the committee to realize that the basis of the stability of any currency is its backing. When we had a gold or sterling currency every one knew that there was a gold reserve of at least 5s. for every £1 note issued.. It is physically impossible for every note to be presented at the Commonwealth Bank or the Treasury at the one time. So we had a system under which the value of the paper money in circulation was much greater than the value of the gold reserve. But henceforth, if this bill is passed - and I have a strong suspicion that it will be - there will be absolutely no reserve behind the currency; it will be based on nothing at all. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Yes. The British note issue is on a different foundation from the Australian. The Treasurer should not think that I do not know the financial conditions in Great Britain. The fiduciary issue of Great Britain is definitely limited, but here the Government is asking us to give the the Commonwealth Bank untrammelled power to issue fiduciary money to an unlimited extent. I am surprised that the Treasurer, or one or two of his noble henchmen, have not come to light with a declaration that the foundation upon which the Australian note issue will rest is to be the credit of the Commonwealth. I anticipate that declaration by saying that the public credit of this country has been seriously impaired by the conduct of the war. We have doubled our public debt, increased the issue of treasury-bills by several-  hundred per cent, and increased the note issue by several hundred per cent. I - have pointed out before that every treasury-bill and every bank note is a debt owed by the Commonwealth Government to those that hold them. I have also pointed out that there has been no increase of the productive capacity of Australia commensurate with the increased obligations of Australia. In other words, we have pledged the public credit of Australia in the last six years in a way which has never been done before in the history of .Australia. We have pledged it in a way in which the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> would never have dreamed of doing in the first world war. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister should not ask kindergarten questions. When members of the Labour party were opposed to the sending of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, I was advocating the raising of ten divisions. We have pledged the public credit of Australia in a way never thought possible six years ago, and it stands to reason that the public credit of the nation is no more inexhaustable than is the credit of a corporation or a private person. There must come a day of reckoning. Honorable members opposite will not always be in control of the treasury bench. They are creating a liability which must be met ultimately out of taxation. At the same time, through some of the financial provisions recently submitted to Parliament, the Government is undermining the very basis upon which successful industries can be established. By increasing the note issue, the Government is destroying the value of wages. The purchasing power of money is linked intimately with the volume of notes in circulation, yet the Government wants to throw down all the barriers and have an open go in the issue of notes. There can be only one end to that. The day of reckoning may be staved off for a while, but wc must consider eventually how we are to meet the interest on the national debt, and what we are to do with the £400,000,000 worth of treasury-bills still unfunded. Peace will bring problems even more complex and difficult than those of war, and they will have to be solved. Therefore, it is necessary that some restraint should be applied so that the note issue may not be increased without the approval of Parliament. For that reason I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- In  normal times there would appear to be little need for a reserve behind the note issue. Trade and commerce go on, with the people paying little heed to the currency, and probably most of them do not even realize that there is any such thing as a reserve either in "gold or in sterling. It may be assumed, therefore, that it is only in time of crisis, such as war or an economic depression, that there would be any need for a reserve at all, and we invariably find that, at such a time, the legal provisions for stabilizing the currency are suspended. The English Bank Act of 1844 provided for a fiduciary note issue of a certain fixed amount, while all notes issued over and above that amount were to be backed, £1 for £1, by gold. Within the first quarter of a century after the passing of the act it was suspended three times. Now, it is not even necessary to suspend the act in order to increase the note issue in Great Britain. The Bank of England merely applies to the Treasurer for permission to increase the issue, the Treasurer approves, and a minute to that effect is placed before Parliament. No Treasurer has ever refused such an application. It is true that- the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems suggested that the Australian note issue should be limited to £60,000,000, but we all realize now how inadequate that would have been during this war when the value of notes in circulation has increased enormously. On the subject of the note issue R. G. Hawtrey, a high official in the British Treasury, and a lecturer in economics, wrote as follows in a book which has become a standard work of reference in Australia - </para>

                    <para>There is also a further principle of central banking of a somewhat different character which must be observed if central banks are to be in complete control of the situation, namely, that central batiks must not be unduly limited in their power to expand their deposits otherwise than against a corresponding increase in their holdings of gold or the equivalent of gold. Such undue limitation may result if the class of assets which the central bank is entitled to hold is too narrowly prescribed by law. Similarly, it should lie within the power of a central bank to restrict the volume of its deposits otherwise than by decreasing its holdings of gold. </para>

                <para class="block">Everything indicates that a reserve behind the note issue is powerless to achieve the end which it is supposed to promote. In order to expand the note issue without raising prices, the issuing authority must watch the situation very closely. It must note how production is affected, and keep constantly in mind the relation between the volume of the note issue and the production of: consumable goods. Even if the Australian note issue had been based £1 for £1 on gold it would still have been necessary, during the war, to increase its value very greatly, and prices would have risen because there was not in the country a sufficient volume of goods to match the increased issue. Thus, we come to the point that a reserve behind the note issue is merely a survival, a tradition, which experience has proved to be of no real value. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> said that currency inflation in Germany after the last war had been brought about by an increase of the note issue. It has been established, however, that bank deposits expanded first, and the note issue was increased in order to catch up with them. It has not been proved1 that the movement was begun by an expansion of the note issue. Actually, although the note issue expanded, the value of! the currency in terms of gold dropped by far more than the expansion of the note issue. We have been told that a note reserve has both a practical and. a psychological value. A great point was made of this when the Scullin Government was in office, but when the gold reserve was finally exported there was no psychological reaction whatsoever. It was found that the people were not in the least worried whether or not there was a gold reserve behind the currency. </para>
                <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> suggested that a reserve had a practical value, but I fail to see wherein it lies. A reserve of gold earns no interest. It is valueless to the country. It would be better employed in the purchase of foreign securities, because they would, at least, hear interest. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> said that even though it might not be necessary to hold a reserve in Australia against the notes in circular tion, it would be advisable to hold British or foreign securities. That is probably true, but at the same time it would be foolish to hold a rigid amount against th'e note issue. If we were able to provide foreign currency for the purchase of capital goods, it would seem paradoxical to have a large reserve of foreign securities, sterling or otherwise, tied up in such a way as to prevent us from using them for our immediate needs. A reserve of gold, as a backing for the note issue, has been proved by history to be valueless and a definite loss to the country. A reserve of securities, if tied rigidly to the note issue, would also be a disadvantage and would have to be suspended in the same way as the gold reserve has had to be suspended from time to time. The Government is dealing with the problem in a realistic manner. The fears which members of the Opposition have attempted to instil in the mind of the public are historically baseless and will not affect the value of Australian currency. </para>

                    <para>.- WhenI asked the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> to inform the committee who was responsible for withdrawing the "promise to pay" on Australian bank notes, he did not reply. I shall repair that omission. In 1932,  the  Lyons Government withdrew the gold reserve  to the  note issue of Australia,  and  introduced legislation which made it compulsory for this country to have  a  reserve  of  English sterling, instead  of  gold, to the value of 25 per cent. of  the  note issue. What is the difference between English sterling and Australian currency? Surely the value of Australian currency should be comparable  with that of  the currency of Great Britain ! It is  all a  matter of psychology. In 1931,  the  Scullin  Government  attempted  to  issue fiduciary notes totalling £18,000.000,  of  which £12,000,000  was to  relieve unemployment, and £6,000,000  to  relieve necessitous farmers. This chamber passed  the  bill, but  the  Senate rejected it. In the same month of the same year, Great Britain printed a fiduciary issue of £68,000,000, and the fiduciary notes were of a different colour from that of the ordinary bank note. </para>

                        <para>- No one took exception to the fiduciary notes, because people did not play politics in Great Britain as they do in this country. It was only because a Labour government was in office in Australia in 1931 that some people here played politics, and the proposal to print a fiduciary note issue was defeated. Of course, the honorable member for Barker has a " craze " regard ing gold. He believes that gold is supreme. Perhaps he has a financial interest in a gold mine. </para>

The abolition of the reserve will not open the way to inflation. Under modern conditions, the volume of the note issue is a reflection of the volume of bank credit. That fact is recognized in Australia and overseas. The <inline font-style="italic">London Stock Exchange Gazette,</inline> on the 17th March last, published the following comment: - </para>

                <para class="block">An important principle of interpretation is involved, namely, whether a prior National Security Regulation automatically prevents this Parliament from enacting by statute whatever legislation it wishes. It is my view that the National Securityregulation to which I have referred will become inoperative should clause 42 of this measure become law. The importance of the result can well be imagined. It will still be legal for black-marketeers and others to use notes of high denominations, and thus circumvent the very necessary reasons for the introduction of such a regulation. There are two points upon which Statutory Rules 1945 No.80 can be attacked. First, is it a valid exercise of the defence power under the Constitution? Secondly, as I have stated in the press, sub-regulation 2 places upon the Commonwealth Bank an obligation to give notes of small denomination in exchange for the larger notes, at any time, even after the 31st August. There is no compulsion upon the holder to give his name and address, and he need not necessarily exchange his notes of a high denomination at any particular time. Also the exchange of such notes between individuals will not be curtailed as the bank will not be able to ascertain whether or not they are being cashed by the original holders. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from notes. The subject is of such a technical nature that in my opinion the use of full notes should he permitted. It is not my intention to move for the disallowance of regulation 135, as under section 10a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1934, after the disallowance of a regulation, no regulation which is the same in substance can be made for six months. It would be far more preferable for the Government to repeal this regulation and submit a more carefully prepared one carrying out the Government's real intention. If it is the intention of the Government to force holders of bank notes . of high denominations to relinquish them, that object is not being achieved, and the matter is one which should he carefully considered. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to note that the Crown Law authorities propose to examine the matter which has been raised by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> It is quite true that section 18 of the National Security Act gives effect to National Security Regulations notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than the National Security Act; but it would bo a most unusual principle if an act of Parliament passed this year were to fetter the hands of the Parliament a year or perhaps two years hence. The normal rule of course is that where there is a provision in an act of Parliament inconsistent with a provision in an earlier measure, the earlier one is repealed to that extent. No doubt the Crown Law authorities will come to the conclusion that if the Government wants the effect of National Security (Supplementary) Regulation 135 to be maintained this clause should be altered. The alteration would he quite simple. I suggest to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> and through him to the legal authorities, that all that need be done is to add at the beginning of clause 42 the words, "Subject to any regulation made under the National Security Act ". Then, if it is desired to preserve any exclusion under the National Security Regulations, that can be done. </para>

I have had some experience in the making of regulations under the National Security Act,, and I know that a regulation can be issued by three Ministers, I am not prepared to hand over that power. </para>

                <para>Honorable members opposite have challenged my views in regard to the stability and acceptability of the currency. I contend that confidence in the stability of the currency could not be harmed more than by the issuing of regulations such as that relating to the surrender of notes of high denomination. When a note is issued by the Commonwealth Bank it should be acceptable by that bank, and should be legal tender within the Commonwealth as is stated on the face of it, without hindrance. The actual fact is that only a very small percentage of the note issue is represented by notes in denominations of £20 or more. The two things which the Government must watch are hoarding and black marketing. I do not know much about black-marketing, and I certainly know nothing about hoarding, because I have never had anything to hoard ; but black marketing will not be. stopped by reducing the denominations of bank notes. If people are foolish enough to accumulate Commonwealth currency and keep it behind the chimney or in a safe deposit, thereby losing interest on it, that is their fault. In no circumstances would I interfere with that practice. If people are foolish enough to deprive themselves of their right to interest income, that is their business. Therefore, for those two reasons I consider that the regulation to which the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has referred is undesirable. " </para>

                    <para>If it is desired that the present allocation of profits should not be disturbed, we are of opinion that the profits of the General Banking Department after it has absorbed the Note Issue Department should be divided between the National Debt 'Sinking Fund and the reserves of the Bank in some such proportion as two-thirds and one-third respectively. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">We envisaged the abolition of the Note Issue Department and its incorporation in the central bank, and the allocation of its profits in the manner stated. There is much to be said for a  large allocation  of the profits from the note issue being made to the National Debt Sinking Fund, because an increase of the amount available for investment in Commonwealth loans by the National Debt Sinking Fund Trust must improve the prospects of loans being raised in the future at lower rates of interest than have had to be paid in the past, and give to the central bank much greater control over the whole of the interest rates throughout the community, in addition to imbuing the people with a far stronger belief in the stability of such loans, by reason of the knowledge that a maximum amount is being diverted in each year to a sinking fund for their redemption. During the Napoleonic wars, the first  sinking fund legislation in the British Empire was brought down ;by the younger Pitt. Actually, the government of the day had to borrow for the exigencies of the Napoleonic wars much more than could he redeemed by means of the sinking fund, but the existence of that first sinking fund that had been introduced by any government in the world enabled loans to be raised at a much lower rate of interest than otherwise would have operated. That has been the position from the days of the younger Pitt up to the present time. The Government ought to consider the matter further, before the bill goes to the Senate. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> should make provision for the allocation of a fairly large proportion of the profits from the note issue to the National Debt Sinking Fund. </para>

                    <para>.- I dissent from the provision that no payment out of the profits from the note issue shall have the effect of increasing the capital of the Mortgage Bank Department to more, than  £4,000,000;  because, if the Mortgage Bank Department is to be in a position to make loans to farmers at the lowest rate of interest, its capital must to the greatest degree be interest free. Under other provisions in  thi9  measure, the Mortgage Bank Department will be enabled to obtain funds from the Savings Bank independently of the capital of  £4,000,000.  In my opinion, that method of obtaining funds is inferior to the indefinite continuance of profits from the note issue. I suggest the removal of that limitation; otherwise, the Mortgage Bank Department will cease to obtain free money when its capital has reached  £4,000,000,  and any subsequent advances by it will have to be made from funds carrying interest which it receives from the Savings Bank. That will necessitate the charging of a higher rate of interest to the farmer than would have to be charged if advances were made from funds derived from profits from the note issue. </para>

Whatever argument could be advanced in favour of it when made, has been greatly reinforced since, because the royal commission recommended among other things the continuance of a backing for the note issue up to a specified limit. Under this legislation, there is to be no such limit; consequently, the recommendation of the commission in that regard has been totally ignored. Surely some degree of confidence must be instilled in the minds of the investing public particularly. Having special regard to the fact that the note issue is not to be backed by a reserve, a greater proportion of the profits from it should be allocated to the National Debt Sinking Fund. The' advantages of strengthening that fund are obvious. They include the greater confidence which the investing public will have, the possibility of the 'Commonwealth Government raising loans at lower rates of interest and on more favorable terms, and the provision of greater facilities whereby the Government may acquire securities on the open market as and when desired in order to stabilize the loan position as well as the security position generally. </para>

                    <para>.- The limitation of  £4,000,000  on the capital that may he raised by the Mortgage Bank Department should be removed. When the royal commission recommended the establishment of that department, the suggestion was that it should be able to raise additional capital by the issue of debentures. It  wa3  proposed that  £250,000  a year should be provided interest free from the profits from the note issue. That has " gone by the board". At a later stage, the provision was made that the total capital of  £4,000,000  should be provided, first by a portion of the profits from the note issue, and then Ivy other moneys which could be  made available. That capital is not nearly sufficient to finance this undertaking. Rural mortgages; in Australia must amount to approximately between £400,000,000 and £500,000,000. The £150,000 per annum obtained from the profits from the note issue is only about one-fifteenth or one-sixteenth of the total profit made from the note issue, which exceeds £2,000,000. That contribution should be made permanent, in order that the interest-free money available in the Mortgage Bank Department may be as large as possible, and ultimately have the effect of reducing the rate 0B interest on long-term mortgages. When T instituted the Rural Credits Department in 1925, I attached a similar stipulation to the provision in relation to its capital, until £2,000,000 interest-free capital had been provided. The effect has been that that department has been able to charge a lower rate of interest than any other institution in Australia that lends money. It deals with commodities in process of being marketed; therefore, the loans that it makes are redeemed practically within a year and a smaller total may suffice for a revolving  captial  fund. On the other hand many of the loans made by the Mortgage Bank Department are outstanding for from 30 to 40 years: therefore, it must have very large capital funds at its disposal. I hope that the Minister assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> will place before that gentleman the necessity for making this contribution in perpetuity. </para>

                <para class="block">We have now reached the 47th clause in a bill which contains 1S9 clauses, and it is now possible to give a summary as to what has transpired in the consideration of the measure. Most of the major amendments have already been moved. The Commonwealth Bank Board, which has been the means of preventing the adoption of hasty and ill-conceived methods of finance has been abolished. The place of the board is to be taken by an official who is termed the Governor. It is true that he will have the assistance of1 an advisory council, but it if equally true that the Governor will please  himself whether he accepts its advice or not. The Governor, in turn, will be subservient to the Treasurer of the day, and if any conflict of opinion arises between the Governor and the Treasurer, the hatter's view will prevail. The committee  ha3  already decided not to require a minute to be drawn up on the matter, which means that nothing about it will appear in writing. The central bank, which for many years has acted in the interests of economic and financial stability, may well become a mere tool of the government of the day. Amendments by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> with regard to the note issue have been rejected, and, therefore, one of the last barriers which prevented the exercise of political pressure behind the scenes has been removed. Under this clause, the note issue could to some degree be concealed, because it merely provides that the number and amount of notes at issue shall be made public, but there is a wide difference between the amount of notes held by the public and the amount issued, [n his second-reading speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> drew attention to the fact that the note issue is merely a " reflection of credit policy ", and in his speech before the suspension of the sitting he used these words, " The note issue is an effect of something else that has been done ". It is true that the potential source of inflationary finance is central bank inflation, but that cannot take place unless it is reflected in the note issue, particularly the note issue in the hands of the public. </para>
                <para>From the days preceding the war until recently, the note issue, which was once £4S,000,000, has been increased to £196,000,000. That, of course, is an indication of the inflationary tactics which in many respects had to be adopted because of the exigencies of war. We were told in January last that the central bank inflation amounted to about £340,000,000 ; to-day it is possibly about £400,000,000. This credit expansion has been associated with the many controls which have been imposed on the public, and if those controls had not been screwed down we should have witnessed a much greater deprecia tion of the Australian £1 than has occurred. At present, the value of the £1 has depreciated by about 25 per cent. This has to be considered in conjunction with the present high taxation rates which are having a marked effect on the present production and output of the individual. The note issue is a reflection of credit policy and shows the effect of what has been done. Under this clause the indications are that the real extent of any inflationary policy could be concealed by the mere issue of a statement giving the amount- of notes on issue, but the number of notes in the vaults of the banks may have little bearing on the economic position. The notes in the hands of the public are those which count, because they imply purchasing power. From 15' per cent, to 20 per cent, of all payments are made by means of notes. As the note issue is split into notes in the hands of the public and notes in the hands of the banks, it gives an indication to the public of the financial policy being carried out by the Government. Under this bill it would be possible, by a verbal arrangement, for the economic policy of the country to be influenced by the Government, and that could lead to further inflation; but if the amount of notes in the hands of the public were made known we should have an accurate picture of what is happening. That picture should always be apparent to the Parliament and to the country. I hope that the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> will not merely ask the Treasurer to consider my amendment, but that he will realize the logic of my argument and accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- No. When the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> is in charge of a bill he is a marvel in his own opinion. Subclause 1 provides that as soon as practicable after the last Monday in each month, an officer appointed for the purpose by the Governor shall prepare and sign a statement showing, as at the close of business on that day, the number and amount of Australian notes on issue. The Minister tells the committee that is what the Commonwealth Bank has been doing for years, and that is why the Government is putting it in the bill. He agrees that for years the bank has been doing it, yet he wants to put it in the bill. The honorable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> proposes, as an amendment, to distinguish between those notes held by the banks and those held by the public, but the Minister then says, " For twenty years the Commonwealth Bank has been doing that and therefore we will not put it in the bill ". </para>

The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said that it was a good thing to keep banking transactions, particularly those of the central bank, as quiet as possible, the suggestion being that the public should not be allowed to know what was going on. The Treasurer of the day may believe that the public should not be given particulars about the way in which notes are held. He might justify the withholding of this information on the ground that, at a time of rising prices, it would have a disturbing effect on the public, and he might send the Secretary to the Treasury to the Governor of the bank with an instruction that the information should not be published. </para>

Up to the present, statistics have been published regularly showing the proportion of notes held by the public and by the banks, and these figures have been included in the Budget each year in the form of an annexure. This has always been regarded by the Commonwealth Bank Board as a financial barometer. Now that the safeguard of a reserve behind the note issue is to be removed, the Government does not propose to let the public know the position of the note issue. The Government should have nothing to hide, and there is no reason why it should not accept the amendment, but trying to got the Government to accept an amendment is like trying to push an elephant up hill. However,we shall go on trying to defend the interests of the public. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> falls to the ground because the whole structure of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-43 is being altered by this legislation, as is shown by the fact that many parts of that measure are being re-enacted. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> says that it has been the practice to publish statistics about the note issue, but there is no assurance that the practice will be followed in future.Control of the Commonwealth Bank will be in the hands of the Governor, and the Governor will be under the direction of the Treasurer. Now that there is to be no reserve behind the note issue, and no limit above which it shall not go, it is more than ever necessary that the public should be informed from time to time just what is going on. For many years past, these periodical analyses of the position of the note issue have been a feature of budget statements, and they show how and in what way the note issue has expanded since 1939. In that year, the public held notes to the value of £34,000,000, while the banks held notes to the value of £14,600,000. In 1944, the figures were £170,000,000 in the hands of the public, and £16,100,000 in the hands of the banks respectively. In practice, a large part of the holdings of the banks was in £1,000 notes. These did not circulate, and therefore did not represent part of the spending power of the community, nor did they affect the speed of currency circulation. By January, 1945, the value of notes held by the banks had increased from only £14,600,000 to £17,700,000, but the value of notes held by the public had increased from £34,000,000 , to £179,000,000. It is important that information of this kind should be available to the public, and its publication should not depend on the goodwill of the Treasurer of the day. </para>

                    <para>.- The refusal of the Government to accept this amendment makes one wonder what is the value of committee work in the Parliament. The purpose of the amendment is to provide for doing something which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> agrees ought to be done, yet for some reason not explained he refuses to accept the amendment. He says that these particulars about the note issue are already being published.Why then should he object to the amendment which merely places it beyond doubt that they shall continue to be published ? Now that there is no longer a fixed limit to the note issue, it becomes psychologically necessary that some assurance of stability should be given to the public, some means provided by which they may gauge the value of the currency. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. If he cannot do so, only one interpretation can be placed on his action. He has told us that since 1921 it has been the practice of the Commonwealth Bank to publish the figures in the way that I have indicated they should he published. In that year, the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of a governor - a system of one-man control, to which the Government proposes to revert. Since 1924 the bank has been under the control of a board, but under both forms of control the central banking functions have at all times been paramount. Under this bill, the control of the Commonwealth Bank is to be completely altered ; the Governor will be told to go out after the business of the trading banks. In another measure which is to come before us there are provisions which, with those in this bill, will sound the death-knell of the private banks. Obviously, the Government wishes to conceal its intentions, but I have no- doubt that its policy will be one of increased inflation. So long as the published figures distinguish between notes held by the public and notes held by the banks, there will be an indication of the financial policy that is being followed. If the Government intends to follow the custom which has been in operation for many years it should embody a provision to that effect in the bill. If it does not do so, we must form our own conclusion as to its reasons. </para>

                <para class="block">That sub-clause may mean that the published figures would indicate a note issue smaller than it really is, because nothing will be known of the volume of the  notes  which will not be included. There cannot be two correct sets of figures setting out the total amount of the note issue. To my mind this is to cover the actual notes in circulation, but it seems to me that the points that I have raised may be well read into this clause, and I do not think that it should be allowed to pass without an explanation of the meaning of these involved terms. </para>

                    <para>. - The bulk of the clauses dealing with the Rural Credits Department are identical with the sections of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-1943 dealing with rural credits, but alterations have been made in others. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> should explain why these alterations have been made because, whatever can be said about other departments of the Commonwealth Bank, the Rural Credits Department has been one of the most successful in Australia. I understand that up to the outbreak of the war no less than £125,000,000 had been advanced by the Rural Credits Department, and that since the outbreak of war a total of more than £^00,000,000 has been advanced by the bank against, primary production. Therefore, there must be some reason for those alterations, but none has yet been given. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> in his second-reading speech did not give any reason for these alterations. I point out that at present, under the Commonwealth Bank (Rural Credits) Act the department may make advances to " other banks ", whereas under this measure " other banks " are omitted from the bodies to whom the department may make advances. One complaint against the department has been that it has not used as fully as it might its opportunities to handle these particular advances by issuing short-term debentures, because these advances, which are made against primary produce in the course of being sold, aro the safest that can possibly be made. For instance, wheat is sold against delivery in London. A farmer wants to be paid immediately he delivers his wheat and under the existing arrangement he can obtain an advance and thereby obviate waiting until actual payment is made by the purchaser of his produce. That payment it collected by the bank. Under this measure, the department will not be able to effect such transactions through other banks as it is able to do at present. I can see no reason for this limitation, particularly when clause 66 provides that the department may make advances to " such bodies, whether corporate or unincorporate, formed under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or territory of the Commonwealth as are specified by proclamation ". As most trading banks are corporate bodies under State laws they could be brought within this provision by proclamation. Therefore, I fail to understand why they should be fir <inline font-style="italic">Earle</inline><inline font-style="italic">Page</inline> eliminated under the measure itself because such a provision deprives the primary producer of the advantage of being able to obtain finance at the very low rate of interest provided. No explanation has been given why the words " other banks " have been deleted. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>My second point is that the provision in the original rural credits legislation for the issue, if necessary, of debentures or trading bills has been eliminated. That provision enabled advances totalling from £16,000,000 to £20,000,000 to be made at a very cheap rate of interest. When I discussed this matter with some of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, I discovered that it was only recently that they had come to realize the extraordinary value of this provision in helping to provide an Australian market. </para>
                <para>For instance, our wheat crop in any one year may be valued at from £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 The crop is harvested in from two to three months. The farmer desires to be paid as soon as he has harvested his crop because he has been waiting a long time for his money while the crop is growing. However, the crop may not be disposed of throughout the markets of the world until twelve months later. .In these circumstances, some system of finance must be provided to enable the farmer to be paid as soon as he has harvested his crop. That is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, organizations such as the Sydney City Council or the Melbourne City Council collect the whole of their rates practically within one month, but spread the expenditure of that revenue over a period of twelve months. We should utilize an institution like the Commonwealth Bank to provide a link between the producer who requires ready finance, to pay for his crop, and. organizations such as I have mentioned, who have surplus funds to invest. Such a system . would promote orderly marketing of primary produce and, at the same time, enable such organizations to invest surplus funds. This facility is to be eliminated under the measure, and it is not being deleted because it has proved useless. I believe that it is being deleted simply because the original provision used the word "debenture". I  recall a debate in this Parliament about three or four years ago when, to the amazement of members of the Labour party they discovered that the original authors of the Commonwealth Bank Bill used the word " debenture " in the original act. To-day, however, members of the Labour party are frightened of that word and through sheer fear have eliminated it in. the way I have indicated. </para>
                <para>I was also hoping that the Rural Credits Development Fund, derived from the profits of the department, would be applied not merely by the Rural Credits Department, but that that body would be empowered to call into consultation the Department of Commerce and Agriculture in order that the fund, which amounts to from £30,000 to £40,000 a year, might be used to the greatest advantage to stimulate research in urgent matters of concern to primary industry, the need for which is pronounced at present. </para>

                <para>Mi-.  ABBOTT  (New England) [10.30]. - I assume that the rate of interest which will be charged by the Rural Credits Department will be approximately the same as it is to-day, namely, 3$ per cent. I do not know whether honorable members realize that the rate of interest is extremely high for first-class self-liquidating securities such as primary products that are moving towards their ultimate markets of consumption. The trading banks, which have been maligned in this chamber during this discussion as grasping organizations that always seize everything they can for their own selfish interests and let their customers down, charge for this kind of advance a rate of interest of 1 per cent, or less per annum for 90 days' accommodation on shipments of goods overseas. "Within 48  hour3  of wool being put into the ships' holds at Newcastle or Sydney, before the war, bills of lading were discounted by the trading banks, and an advance paid into the customers account at a rate of interest, on Bank of England discount rates, of 1 per cent, or less per annum for 90 days' accommodation.

The Commonwealth Bank might well consider, in connexion with the Rural Credits Department, establishing a bill market on the lines of the bill market operated by the Bank of England for the handling and financing of primary products in Australia on first-class paper. The Commonwealth Bank should be prepared to discount that first-class paper at the same rate as the Bank of England will discount it overseas. Private enterprise is not popular with the Government, but when it shows the way in which, to assist primary producers with extremely low rates of interest, the Government should not be so pig-headed as to refuse to follow its example. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been very interested in the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and in my second-reading speech I eulogized its work, in assisting primary producers and cooperative organizations. Since the establishment of the department, primary producers, through organized industries, have been able to obtain, to my knowledge, the lowest rate of interest operating in Australia. I was interested to hear the contention of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> in reference to accommodation from another source for 90 days, at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum, but that term would not be sufficient. Under the Rural Credits Department, as we shall see in another clause, advances are made for one year only. However, an interest rate of 3^ per cent, is still somewhat high. After all, the primary producers have to wait for payment for their crops during the period of growth, and until realization. Sometimes twelve months elapse before the final payments are made. Payments up to a maximum of 80 per cent, of the value of the produce are made as a first advance, and from, that amount is deducted the estimated expenses of the crop. Therefore, in effect, the growers at first receive about 50 per cent, of the net return 'from their crops, and. on the balance they have to pay interest from their own income. I suggest to the Government, in all seriousness, that the interest rate, when fixed by the Commonwealth Bank, should be only a nominal amount and not necessarily one that would make large profits. </para>

                <para class="block">I detect a vital difference between the clause in this bill and the comparable section of the act. Under the existing act, control by the Commonwealth Bank Board, an independent body, guarantees that political interference shall not be exercised in connexion with the Rural Credits Department. But when this clause becomes operative, the Governor of the bank will be under the direction of the Treasurer of the day, and the guarantee against the exercise of political interference will not operate. This provision re-opens the whole subject of political interference. On the surface the clause may be all that it purports to be, but the fact remains that, as long as the Rural Credits Department is likely to be subject to political interference, some safeguard should be inserted in the bill for the purpose of removing that danger. </para>
                <para>I also direct attention to the words " such amounts, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Governor determines ". I ask : " What amounts, and how much? " The amount that may be determined by a particular Treasurer for the necessary development of rural industries, may well interfere with the central banking fund, and destroy one of its functions. The central banking fund will be held for the purpose of meeting a possible crisis in the banking system, and if such amounts that may be determined are not specified, the central banking funds may be seriously interfered with. This clause has possibilities entirely different from those of the section of the existing act. Independent control of banking has been removed by vesting full powers in the Treasurer of the day, through the Governor of the bank, and a safeguard should be included in the bill against political interference. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is self-explanatory, but I should like some information in regard to the financial accommodation that is to be made available to organizations such as co-operative marketing boards which desire to enter the realm of manufacture. Probably these organizations will be provided for by the Industrial Finance Department, but I should like to know where ,the line of demarcation is to be drawn. Some marketing boards which to-day are engaged solely in marketing activities may wish to engage in secondary production. Butter factories, of course, may be regarded as being in that category now, and they are provided for under the rural credit portion of this legislation. Expansion of the activities of co-operative marketing boards may be most desirable, and provision should be made for financial accommodation. </para>

                    is one of great importance. I believe that the Government could overcome the difficulty envisaged by the honorable member by adding the words " and products " to each item in the second schedule. For instance the word " wool " would be followed by the words " and wool products ". According to the bill products such as scoured wool, carbonized wool or woollen yarns would not be covered at all.

It would not be possible to go through the whole list of metal-manufactured products, although in bill marketing overseas that, in effect, is what is done. Timber cut in the forests of Sweden is covered by bill marketing until it goes through the joinery mills in Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. -  I had hoped that when the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> spoke he would have said something about the point referred to by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> - a point which I had in mind to raise on clause 6'6. If honorable members will examine section 138 of the existing Commonwealth Bank Act they will see that advances may be made by the Rural Credits Department, upon the security of primary produce placed under the legal control of the bank, to the bank or other banks, co-operative associations. Aic.; and such corporations or lin incorporate bodies as are specified by proclamation. Under clause 66, which to some degree is modelled on the existing provision, all reference to " the bank " or " other banks " has been omitted. I can understand quite clearly the reason for omitting the reference to " the bank ", because under clause 66, it is the bank that is making the advances.; but I cannot understand the omission of the reference to " other banks ". Has the Government decided as a matter  of  policy that the organizations of the other banks are not to be available as instru-ments that can be used by the Rural Credits Department? They can be used under the existing law, but not under thislegislation. I did think for a moment that somebody had reached the conclusion that there was no occasion to refer to the other banks because they would come under sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> and be bodies corporate, but, of course, that will not do, because under that sub-paragraph certain of the banks would be included, and others would not. For example the National Bank of Australia Limited, has a Victorian incorporation. Therefore it could be proclaimed under sub-paragraph b; but the Bank of Australasia has an English incorporation, as has the Union Bank, and therefore neither of these could be proclaimed. I draw the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to the fact that the reconstruction of the existing section omits - evidently deliberately and with some point - "the banks " from the description of the bodies to whom advances may be made under the rural credits scheme. I raise the  matter  merely in an inquisitive way. There  may  be a good reason for this action, but if  so,  it is one that should be placed clearly before the committee by the Minister. </para>

Canary seed, is mentioned specifically, yet it is definitely a grain, provision for which is made further on. Also, I cannot find any reference to grass seeds, the collection of which is a very important industry in many parts of Australia. These cannot be called grain in any circumstances. Take, for instance, clover and. rye grass seed, to mention only two. Some clover seed is not even grain in the ordinary sense of the word. We have only to look at two or three varieties to see that. Then there is sunflower seed. I? that a grain or not? The collection of sunflower seed is becoming an increasingly important industry in certain parts of Australia. Liquorice, which is grown in some parts of South Australia, is not included, whereas chicory is. </para>

                <para>I do not know exactly what the Government means by the term " metals ". Does it include radium? That is not a metal, but it is precious. Does it include such things as rutile and zircon? Zircon is not a metal, but it is a mineral of some sort and certainly is precious. I have seen crystals of it as big as my first. Feldspar is being mined in certain places, and out of it false teeth are made. Does the term "metals" include feldspar? A gem in the rough state that is very much sought after to-day is beryl, out of which the important mineral beryllium, used in the manufacture of very light alloys for aircraft production, is made. Is beryllium included? The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has heard a good deal from me in the last twelve months about mica, and wrote to me to-day concerning it. I do not think that it can be classed as a metal. </para>

                    <para>.- On the 27th April the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> stated in the House that  my  department was attempting to turn  a  widower and his three children out  of  their home  at  Alice Springs. That  is  not correct. The children of the officer concerned are not at Alice Springs and are not living with their father. They returned  to  Adelaide approximately last November with the officer's mother. After the departure  of  the children, the officer took another officer  to  share the house, and they have continued  to  occupy  it.  The housing shortage  at  Alice Springs  is  very acute, and  it is  not considered desirable that a house should be occupied  by  men who have not their families living with them, particularly when there are other families waiting accommodation. As this officer has sent his children to Adelaide, where they are living with his mother, it is rightly considered by my department that he should live  at  the men's hostel  at  Alice Springs, and allow his house  to  be occupied by another man who has a wife and family. </para>

                    <para>I refer to your request of this morning that you should receive some written indication that it is not proposed to proceed with the notice given to you on the 18th April last, which required you to vacate by the 18th May the governmental cottage at present occupied by you. It would appear that you misunderstood the correct position. The notice already served on you stands and it is still the desire of the  Deputy  Director-General that the cottage be vacated. </para>
                    <para>However, as you or some one on your behalf has seen fit to place the facts before the Minister for Works, it is my duty to inform you that until receipt of instructions from the Minister, no further action will be taken by the Deputy Director-General in connexion with the tenancy of the cottage. </para>

                <para>It is nearly time the Curtin Government examined its eviction policy, otherwise it will assemble at a Cabinet meeting one of these days and will read on the door a notice to this effect, " Evictions at the shortest notice and carried out in the most haphazard way". This is a case in which the tenant has shown what he is prepared to do, but another man who is senior to him wants his house. If there is one place in the Territory which has buildings to burn it is Alice Springs. </para>

Protests were made against people having to vacate their houses in order to make way for senior officers. When through the loss of his wife, a man has been forced to send his children away, but is now prepared to bring them back, the least that should be done is to enable him to retain possession of his home. If this man does not get. the deal to which I think he is entitled I shall have occasion to refer to it, again. </para>

                    <para>.- Something should be done to recognize the services of the forgotten men of this war, the members of the Volunteer Defence Corps. During the dark and early days of the war, the. Volunteer Defence Corps was our first line of defence. It was composed mostly of men of middle ago and young men who were unfit for strenuous military service. The members of the corps prepared for action round the coastline of Australia, and did very good work without much publicity. They were mostly employed in essential industries, or in jobs of an important nature. Their training involved leaving their jobs on Friday evenings and spending their week-ends relieving garrisons on the coast, and returning to their normal duties on Monday mornings. The people were consoled by their presence during the early period of the Japanese thrust southwards, but as the war effort increased in volume, the importance of the Volunteer Defence Corps diminished. Yet the people owe their home guard the same measure of appreciation as the Government of Great Britain has decided to give to the home guard in the Old Country. A service ribbon should be awarded to the Volunteer Defence Corps for its efforts in the war. Here is an opportunity for this Parliament to reassert its Australianism, and do something for the men who were prepared to defend the mainland of Australia. J suggest that a Southern Cross star could be provided in recognition of services rendered on the mainland. A wards in the past have been conditioned by British awards, but surely it would be competent for the Commonwealth Government to provide an award for those who defended the mainland, and who were prepared to undertake the last ditch fighting if the war actually came to this country. Veterans of the last war, and others who were not called up, formed the Volunteer Defence Corps whose training was comparable with some of the toughest jungle training that is given to Australian troops to-day. Members of the corps were submitted to a gruelling test, because it was not known in those days whether they would not have to face the enemy on our own shores. To adapt the phrase of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> they might have had to face the enemy on the beaches and in the streets of Australia. Now we have forgotten these men. It would be a gracious thing for the Commonwealth to provide some specific decoration to commemorate their services. I commend the suggestion to the Minister for consideration in the right quarter.  </para>

                    <para>Although the Minister stated that such weapons in the hands of the police in Sydney had been examined, he had not yet satisfied himself that they were of Army issue. He mentioned only four weapons. In th.e press to-day, there is a report by a high police officer that there are 24 sub-machine guns in the hands of the police. I do not know the types of these weapons, but it is evident that they are from Army sources, munitions factories, or some other government source. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that these weapons must lie coming from the Army authorities, munitions factories, or from some other government source. They are not privately manufactured  weapons so far as we know. They have been manufactured for the Army. Every weapon so produced bears a serial number, and it should not be a difficult task to trace the channels through which the weapons now in the hands of the police have passed. </para>

                        <para>- I did not. I produced the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of what I did say, and this shows that, far from it being I who made false statements, it is the Minister who has been making lying statements in this chamber, statements in which he has distorted what was said by honorable members on this side of the House in order to serve his own ends. The Minister made a scurrilous attack on me based on a lie. It is possible to find out where the weapons were obtained. Some of them, I presume, were used for illegal purposes against citizens. If they are of Australian manufacture it can be discovered where they came from. There is a serial number on each machine gun, sub-machine gun, rifle and pistol by which it is possible to trace where the weapon came from, and even the very man to whom it was issued. By co-operation between the Department of the Army, the Department of Munitions and the police it should be possible to curb this growing danger. I strongly resent the distortion of my statement by the Minister, whose duty it should be to uphold the law and to assist the police to trace criminals, instead of trying to shield them. </para>

I then informed the honorable member that the Solicitor-General might forward the article to the court and, if the court decided to take action, the Attorney-General's Department would make available legal aid. </para>

                    <para>I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that, as the <inline font-style="italic">Century</inline> is published on Friday of each week, and the conference was held on the 12th and 13th May, there was no issue of the paper on the 10th May, and, if there was, no report of a conference which had not taken place could possibly have appeared therein. A report of the conference, however, appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Century</inline> of the 18th May and, on the assumption that this was the article referred to by the honorable member, the Solicitor-General forwarded it to the Industrial Registrar for consideration of the Arbitration Court. Advice has now been received from the Industrial Registrar that the judges of the court do not consider that it is a case in which the court should act <inline font-style="italic">ex mero motu</inline> or a case which calls for the summary power of the court to prosecute for contempt. In the view of the judges the article falls far short of the publications for which the proprietor and editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> were fined £500 and £.1.15, respectively, with costs. </para>
