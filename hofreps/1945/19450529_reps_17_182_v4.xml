                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I am sure the House will be interested in the result of the conversion loan which closed in London last Friday, the 25th May. In respect of ##£##94,000,000 of London loans for which options of redemption accrued this year, the Government sought conversions to an amount of ##£##60,000,000, and decided to repay and repatriate ##£##34,000,000. These loans carried interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum; ##£##29,000,000 represented Commonwealth debt, and ##£##65,000,000 debts of the various States. I have received from the Australian High Commissioner in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the advice that conversion applications totalling ##£##56,689,000 have been received. This represents 95 per cent, conversion and is an admirable result. The amount necessary to complete the conversion of the ##£##60,000,000 will be provided by the Commonwealth Bank, which will also make available funds to cover the ##£##34,000,000 to be repatriated. The new securities to be issued in London, and also securities to be issued to the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the amount repatriated, will carry interest at the rate of 3-J per cent, per annum. The aggregate saving of interest to the Australian governments concerned in the operation will be about ##£##2,000,000 per annum, whilst the interest on the repatriated ##£##34,000,000 will be payable in Australia instead of in London, thus avoiding overseas remittances to an amount of ##£##2,700,000 sterling per annum. Never previously had a single overseas loan operation of such magnitude been attempted by any Commonwealth Government, and its highly successful conclusion is a matter for great satisfaction. </para>

                        <para>- I have read the published report of Judge O##'##Mara##'##s findings and comments. I have had some difficulty in following  His  Honour##'##s comments. He began by saying that certain matters were not for the Trades and Labour Council but for the Arbitration Court. At a prior stage he had called Anderson and Bulmer before his court and examined them in relation to actions alleged to flout the authority of the court.  His  concluding statement was that he had no intention of recording any specific findings in connexion with the matter. I may not be viewing the circumstances in the correct light, but I find it difficult to follow  His  Honour##'##s line of reasoning in declining to record specific findings after he had called those persons before the court, had heard evidence from them, and had declared that the matters in dispute were matters for the court and not for Anderson or the Trades and Labour Council to determine. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. I do not claim to have legal knowledge to analyse or cons true a judicial pronouncement in such matters; but I do regard myself as competent to apply to it the reasoning of the average person. It has occurred to me at times that a better situation would prevail if some persons would confine themselves to judicial questions, and would refrain from interference in political questions or questions that are outside the sphere of their influence and direction. From the outset of this case, I have found it difficult to decide the purpose which the court sought to achieve in connexion with. Anderson and Bulmer. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) has suggested, perhaps it would be proper to ask the Solicitor-General to examine  His  Honour##'##s findings, and make whatever comment he considers warranted. To my knowledge, Anderson is not a member of the Communist party. </para>

He told the judge what his policy in regard to picking-up labour was, and the judge took no exception to the scheme outlined.

                        <para>- The agenda for the next conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers have not yet been prepared, as the Government has not yet considered the business to be brought forward. Personally, I consider that a law ought to be passed to provide against any skyrocketing of the prices of those good. which may be in short supply  after  the war. It is clear to everybody that unless, in the post-war period, some control be exercised, the public will have to. pay inflated prices for certain goods, and some of them will be essential goods. I should have thought that it was a matter for consideration by the States as to whether they should either refer the necessary power to the Commonwealth, or themselves undertake some form of ##&gt;##price control which would reduce the eviL There will be difficulty, of course, in six States having six separate controls of prices, and under such a system gross anomalies would arise. I think that the matter ought to be considered at the next conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, but the Government has not yet determined its policy on this matter. Any proposed alteration of the Constitution involving a referendum would bc a matter for this Parliament to determine. </para>

                        <para>- An announcement was made some months ago that the octane rating of petrol was to be reduced from 80 to about 70, which necessarily resulted in an inferior grade of petrol being supplied to the public. A subsequent announcement was made of a reduction of the price of petrol, but people probably thought that they derived little benefit from the change when the quality also was reduced. I shall have inquiry made regarding the matter, and a reply, will be furnished to the honorable member later. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister representing the Minister for Supply arid Shipping read the statement in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of the 25th May in which Councillor W. F. Sampson, of the Fremantle Municipal Council, stated that ships from the eastern States were arriving at Fremantle in ballast? Councillor Sampson said that the Fremantle Council had purchased 350 tons of road metal which had been carried as ballast in a ship. In view of the acute shortage of essential articles, such as refrigerators and tyres and tubes for bicycles, and the fact that merchandise to the value of thousands of pounds awaits shipping space, will the Minister have inquiries made into the allegations by Councillor Sampson, with a view to preventing a recurrence of the practice to which he directed attention? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member mentioned this matter to me yesterday, and I considered it to be of such importance that I made inquiries about it. I am informed that not more than two vessels have been sent from the eastern States to Fremantle in ballast for the purpose of loading grain and fodder for shipment back to the eastern States. In view of the fact that the Australian proportion of berthage in Fremantle is limited to two general cargo ships, one coal-discharging ship and one grainloading ship, it is impracticable without wasting tonnage to load more vessels with general cargo than the port can handle. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The general cargo vessels cannot be discharged in Fremantle quickly enough to permit of having a vessel continuously in the grain berth. Hence it was necessary on two occasions to send vessels in ballast from the eastern States to Fremantle to load grain. It is a fact that a vessel discharged road metal in Fremantle, and that the metal was sold to the Fremantle Municipal Council. However, this vessel came under Australian jurisdiction only when it arrived in Adelaide from overseas with the ballast aboard. This vessel loaded general cargo and sheep in Adelaide for Fremantle. </para>

                        <para>- I shall try to have a statement prepared setting forth the present position. Several matters associated with lend-lease and reciprocal lend-lease are still outstanding, and will not be settled, I take it, for a considerable time yet. Certain goods, such as machinetools, have been supplied to this country under an agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America as to the price which the United Kingdom would pay. Although a general record is kept regarding all transactions, and of value also, in a general way, no definite accounting has been done regarding the amount of lend-lease aid received by us, or of the reciprocal lend-lease given by us to the United States of America. Each contracting nation undertook to supply the needs of the others to the- full extent of its resources, and that undertaking has been adhered to. </para>

                        <para>- I did not see the letter to which the honorable member refers. It may be that there was a typographical error in its publication. I shall have the matter looked into. As for the letter which was written to the Minister for Labour and National Service, and published, presumably, without his consent, Judge Drake-Brockman may have had a reason for doing so, although it is not the usual practice. Perhaps it would be best for me to leave the matter to Judge Drake-Brockman and the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister received a request from the Queensland Council of Agriculture that three shifts be retained in Queensland flour mills? If so, will the Minister arrange that effect be given to that request, because of reports that the Commonwealth##'##s decision to reduce flour mill shifts from three to two will mean a severe curtailment of food for poultry, dairy cattle and pigs, and might even lead to the compulsory slaughtering of 1,500,000 poultry so that there may be feed enough for what stock remains? </para>

                            <para>- It is true that I have received a protest from the Queensland Council of Agriculture about the reduction from three to two of the number of shifts worked in flour mills in that State. Only a certain quantity of wheat is available until next harvest, and it is proposed to eke out this quantity on a rationed programme. There will not, however, be any reduction of the quantity of stock feed available to users. Only 30 per cent. of milled wheat is available for stock feed in the form of offal, and it is proposed to make up in whole wheat for the loss of offal resulting from the reduction of the number of shifts worked in the mills. </para>

Every right thinking person in the community should rise in protest against the Government##'##s inactivity in this matter. The Government takes little or no interest in providing homes, notwithstanding that the Speech of His Royal Highness the Governor-General at the opening of Parliament, contained references to the subject. In a recent broadcast statement the Deputy Director of Housing in Victoria said that, in order to make up the leeway, about half a million houses were required in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am not satisfied  with the present position. I want the ex-servicemen to have their own homes, but apparently the Government is indifferent to their needs. The Government has fallen down on the joh. I ask that instead of holding further conferences the Government shall take positive action to provide homes for members of the fighting services. If half the time that the bureaucrats now take in trying to find excuses for not building homes were devoted to obtaining materials and arranging for the construction of houses, many homes would already have been built. In Great Britain the housing problem has been tackled in a business-like way; homes have been brought from Norway, and materials have been obtained from all parts of the world. Houses are ready for men when they return from active service. In Canada the position is even better than it is in Great Britain. The application of the guillotine to the discussion does not permit me to give details of what other countries have done, but the inaction of the Commonwealth Government stands out in contrast to what has been done in other parts of the British Empire. No other government has fallen down on the job as the Commonwealth Government has done. This bill has been described as the charter of service men and women, but if the erection of one war service home in five and a half years is evidence of what they may expect, the prospects are not alluring. Any honorable member who does not urge the Government to provide homes for members of the fighting forces is guilty of a dereliction of duty. I urge that the present lethargic policy be discontinued, and that positive action be taken to provide homes for service men and women who need them. If a proper organization were functioning it would see that homes were built for the men before they obtain their discharges. </para>

                    <para>.- On a number of occasions I have referred to the need for a progressive housing programme. The information given by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> was elicited from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> in reply Jo questions which I directed to him. The Minister informed me that fifteen houses had been built by the War Service Homes Commission during the war, and that of that number, eleven were for soldiers of the last war and three for men who fought in the present war. There is no need to do more than quote those figures to show how deplorable is the present situation. I am aware that many difficulties exist, including a shortage of building materials, but in reply to a question which I asked recently I was informed that the Government was building stores at Broadmeadows and Tottenham at a cost of about ##£##325,000. In their construction hundreds of bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and other artisans were employed, whilst the materials used would have built thousands of homes. Li addition, the Government has commenced the building of a new arbitration court in Melbourne at a cost of about ##£##60,000, and has decided to provide additional temporary accommodation for the Repatriation Commission in Melbourne at a. cost of approximately ##£##80,000. Every one thousand pounds of those sums would build a home. In. this city, within a few hundred yards of Parliament House, a huge building, apparently temporary, too, is being erected for the Prices Branch. Prices control is necessary, but we believe it to be transient. I feel certain that that large expenditure is not warranted when people need homes so badly ns they do. More than 300,000 homes arc needed in Australia, and this is not a country which has been battered as Great Britain has been. If honorable members saw the cities and even the villages of Great Britain, they would realize what an immense housing problem it has. Millions of homes have to be built or repaired. I was told in an answer to a question that in addition to Government buildings in Australia only six houses had been destroyed and 100 damaged by enemy action. It seems that tb##«## Government has been unable to grapple with the problem. All honorable members have received pathetic letter* from returned servicemen who find no possibility of getting a roof over their heads. Families are compelled to live in single rooms in squalor. Single men cannot marry because they have no homes to take their brides to. A returned airman was tired of writing letters to land agents and brought out a roneoed circular which he sent to every land agent in Melbourne whose address he could find.

                <para class="block">The writer is only one of many. It is of no use the Minister telling us about difficulties of labour and materials. The War Service Homes Commission is efficient - I am not blaming it - but I have ascertained that it has a director, sis deputy-directors, six architects and more than 100 employees, quite apart from about 40 on war service. It is officered almost entirely by men who served in the last war. They will do the job if the policy is laid down. The Government is to blame for not having laid down a policy. This omnibus bill devotes only a few words to the subject of housing of returned men. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said that homes were almost as important as jobs. I say that a home is equally important.. What disappointment greets men who have served their country in war for five or six years when they return to find that the Government has don*1 nothing to provide homes for them. Private enterprise cannot build, because the Directorate of War Organization of Industry, which is also controlled by the </para>

It takes three months to get an answer ##"## Yes ##"## or ##"## No ##"##, and in 90 per cent. of the cases, the answer is ##"##No##"##. Even if a man owns a piece of land he cannot build. To buy land one has to apply to the Treasury for permission. The War Service Homes Commission is not building.

                <para class="block">I asked the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> to-day whether he was aware of the anomaly whereby a man who may have served four or five years but is still serving cannot make application for a war service home, whereas a man who may have served for only twelve months can, and thatwives of prisoners of war in Japanese hands and widows of men who have given their lives for their country, are not allowed to buy war service homes, probably because the latter are not regarded as good risks. He replied in the affirmative, and he gave no indication of any action to correct the anomaly. In New Zealand, where there is also a Labour administration but one which is awake to its responsibilities, a soldier##'##s widow can get a war service home. I ask the Minister to have the War Service Homes Act amended to provide that soldiers##'## widows may purchase war service homes. The act was effective for the purposes of the last war, but it does not meet the needs that have arisen in this war. The act should also be amended to enable the wives of prisoners of war to purchase war service homes. Widows should be able to buy homes regardless of how long it will take them to complete the purchase. Surely, the Government has a responsibility to the children of such widows; in the event of death, the Government could perhaps waive the outstanding balance of the debt. Surely, the Government is not so ungrateful that it will not allow men on active service to have a stake in the country in the form of their own homes. Surely, just because a widow has only a small pension, she should not be disqualified from buying a war service home. It will probably startle all honorable members who have had war service to know that widows are disqualified. Anomalies obtrude as the war progresses towards its end. Widows and the wives of men who have had long service or of prisoners of war should be able to obtain war service homes. I ask the Government to give that matter the most serious consideration. If it will lift the restrictions and allow private enterprise to build, homes will be produced. Recently, in Melbourne, a returned airman marched the streets with a sandwich-board saying that he could not get accommodation anywhere. Finally, a building contractor took pity on him, and, after having got a permit, built him a home on long terms. It was done quickly. The. Government should revise its restrictions. They are outmoded. The war in Europe is over, and many of the controls could be abolished. The restrictions on the building of homes are among the first that should be lifted. I do not want to reiterate what I have said before, but I have tried to got from the Minister a statement that the Government has a policy and will build so many thousand homes a month, according to its capabilities. We have the Department of Post-war Reconstruction producing grandiose proposals.The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> published a very amusing article last week about the scores of economists and planners in that department. It is a regular planners##'## picnic. It is not building homes, however. The Government of New Zealand has earmarked for servicemen 50 per cent. of the homes being built. A similar policy is supposed to he applied in Australia by the Commonwealth </para>
                <para class="block">Housing Commission. When I asked how many homes built by it bad gone to returned men, I was told that the information was not available. I assert, however, that very few have. Let the Minister for Repatriation, even if he is a junior Minister, stir up Cabinet and say, ##"##We want homes, not plans##"##. Let him persuade the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> and any with sympathy towards the returned men to create a riot in the Cabinet and caucus in order to get things done. We hope that many of our men will have been demobilized in twelve months##'## time, and they will become embittered if they find that the Government has been merely playing with them. Combustible human material of that description is dangerous. Unfortunately, the returned soldiers have been fooled for years, and they will know what to do with the men in public life who have deceived them. During the last five years the Government has failed to submit any kind of a satisfactory programme to meet the housing needs of the community. I hope that it will admit its past failures and attempt, now, to do something effective. </para>

                    <para>. - T was asked during question-time to-day, why temporary offices were being built for my department in Melbourne. I replied some weeks ago to a similar question by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> We gave our offices in Melbourne to the American Army which urgently needed accommodation when the first American troops came to Australia. The departmental staff then numbered about 250, but, as everybody knows, repatriation staffs are growing everywhere. At present the Melbourne staff numbers 500 officers, and it occupies temporary quarters taken over from Melford Motors about six months after the war in the Pacific began. It is estimated that by the time the war ends we shall have a staff of SOO in Melbourne. Does the honorable member for Balaclava suggest that the Government, should wait till the war ends before it endeavours to obtain accommodation? The Hirings Administration has been doing its best to obtain accommodation, but it has failed. Other appropriate authorities also have been seeking accommodation in Melbourne, but they, too, have failed. The department has worked under very great difficulties in its existing quarters, and many officers have made great sacrifices in order to carry on their work. In view of the great and growing need for additional accommodation, I consider that the provision of the temporary offices is amply justified. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member for Balaclava has urged that soldiers still in the forces, or their wives acting on their behalf, should be allowed to apply for war service homes. That proposal has been under consideration ever since the end of the last war, but responsible authorities, aware, of all the facts, have never recommended its adoption. It will be readily recognized, for example, that a soldier##'##s wife might apply for a home in a situation of which the soldier himself would not approve. Soldiers desire to be on the spot to make a proper selection when they lodge their applications. When we settle a soldier in a home we want him to be satisfied to remain there for the rest of his days, if he so desires. I have done, and am still doing, everything possible to provide homes for returned soldiers. </para>

I will not delude returned soldiers by telling them that the Government will build homes for them at once, when I know that it cannot do so, nor will I make promises to them that I know full well I shall not be able to honour. Recently the commission called for tenders for the erection of two homes in Sydney estimated to  cost about ##£##1,000 each. Only one tender was received and the price was ##£##2,100 each. Do honorable members opposite suggest that the Government should load an additional ##£##1,100 on to soldiers who desire homes, even if they have the money available? </para>

                        <para>- Under the War Service Homes Act the Government is required to call for public tenders for the homes it needs, and the fact that only one tender was received on this occasion is a complete answer to the honorable gentleman##'##s interjection. The Government is of the opinion that satisfactory homes at reasonable prices are desired by the men and women who are entitled to them, and a tender at more than double the estimated cost is by no means satisfactory. I do not intend to deceive the soldiers by telling them that we can do things which we know very well we cannot do at present. The war is still raging in the Pacific and the continued arrival of naval and military personnel in this country to carry on the war creates difficulties for Australia in relation to housing which do not exist in New Zealand. </para>

The fact of the matter is that the Government is not doing anything for ex-servicemen as returned soldiers; it does not intend to do so. The clause has been designed to override ex-servicemen in relation to their housing needs.

                <para class="block">That is typical of the case of almost every ex-serviceman who did not establish himself in a home prior to going to the war; and even those who had homes and let them, cannot regain possession until the Government has fulfilled its promise to alter the Landlord and. Tenant Regulations. There should be a definite move towards the building of war service homes. The Government can enter into an agreement with, and make moneyavailable to, the States. It would appear that the Minister is not strongenough to impose his will on behalf of ex-servicemen. Although the housing of these men has reached only the blue-print stage, money and materials can be found to repair the head-quarters of the Communist party and buildings that are used for trade union purposes, erect other temporary buildings, and .provide staff head-quarters. The policy of the Minister is completely defeatist. The specific purpose for which this provision was designed is disclosed by the words ##"## other persons or classes of persons ##"##. The housing needs of all other sections of the  community  will be met before the ex-servicemen will have any opportunity to obtain war service homes. </para>

                    <para>.- The outburst of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> did not surprise me in the slightest degree. I should like to hear a constructive suggestion for the alleviation of the housing position in Australia, including the needs of ex-servicemen and their dependants. The hill empowers the Government to take certain action in conjunction with the States. Quite a lot has ##'##been said about New Zealand. That dominion is in the happy position of having only one Government to administer its affairs, whereas, because of the defeat of the referendum proposals, the Commonwealth has to reach an agreement with the States before it can deal with certain matters. Unlike the honorable member for Wentworth, I have had quite a lot of experience in home construction, and the building trade generally. In South Australia, private enterprise is going ahead with the building of homes whereever possible. We are only a small nation in point of population, and we have been required to do a colossal job. Only recently, a3 I have pointed out on more than one occasion, ##£##30,000,000 had to be set aside to provide facilities for the British Fleet. But for that, much more material and man-power would have been available to the various States for home building. The Government does not intend to sidestep its obligations in this or any other matter. When the time is opportune, I should like money for the building or purchase of homes to be made available to ex-servicemen at a very low rate of interest, and the rate should be reviewed from time to time, because even a reasonable charge should be capable of reduction when the circumstances became more favorable. A grand idea would be for the Government to institute a scheme of insurance, under which any home in course of purchase would become the property of a widow on the death of her husband. To-day, the widow is called upon to pay interest on the amount borrowed. There is very little Oregon in South Australia at the present time, and supplies of it cannot be obtained for roofing purposes. In 1940, when we had been at war for practically a year, the imports of timber in the rough state totalled 348,098,000 super, feet. The Commonwealth Statistician advised me last Friday that our imports of timber in the rough state during the last nine months have totalled approximately 54,738,000 super, feet, or about oneseventh of the quantity imported in 1940. This drop in imports must be held largely accountable for the shortage of this necessary material for housing purposes. There is also a shortage of galvanized iron. The result is, that in South Australia practically every house now being built will have a tile roof, which needs twice as much timber as an iron roof. I have a plan of a five-roomed house which, with deep drainage and a tile roof, could be built in South Australia for ##£##850. Without deep drainage, and with a septic tank, the cost would be ##£##10 less. It consists of a lounge room 12 feet by 13 feet, dining-room 12 feet by 12 feet, one bedroom 12 feet by 10 feet 9 inches, another bedroom 12 feet by 8 feet, kitchen 15 feet by 11 feet, bathroom 7 feet by 5 feet, laundry 7 feet by 6 feet, and water closet 6 feet by 3 feet. South Australia needs another 100 brickmakers. Class B2 men are being released to the brickmaking industry, but because of the very heavy nature of the work stronger men are needed. I have learned from the South Australian Housing Trust that tile hangers are required. If they were available, house-building could proceed at a much faster rate. Housing was a problem long before the outbreak of war. In South Australia, not one house was built in the metropolitan area under the Advances for Homes Act, between 1934 and 1938. </para>

                <para class="block">Nine years have gone by, and if the Opposition had given attention to the problem of housing when it was in power the shortage would not have been so acute as it is to-day. Every man, woman and child in the community is not merely an economic unit but also a potential parent, and, as a nation is built on the basis of the home, the increase of the population will be determined, to a great degree, on the encouragement given to family life. In South Australia 100 additional men are required in the brickmaking industry. Owing to the shortage of iron the building industry is in need of tile hangers. If brick-makers were released from the services the building of houses would be speeded up. </para>

We have been fighting the greatest war in history, and hundreds of thousands of our men have been serving with the colours. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehy)</inline> mentioned the difficulty, due to the war, of getting supplies of timber, iron, ##&amp;##c, in South Australia. In 1928, the Bruce-Page Government brought down a housing bill which was duly passed through Parliament, but not one house has been built as a result of it - not even in the Australian Capital Territory, over which this Parliament has complete control. When I entered this Parliament in 1934, I took a great interest in Canberra, and was much concerned about the housing shortage. In this regard,I cannot give much credit to the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> or the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart),</inline> who were both members of a government which might have done something about housing, but did not. </para>

Probably every returned man who qualifiedunder the act obtained a home if he applied for it, but some of them lost their homes during the depression. The War Service Homes Act is a very good one, although the rate of interest is too high. In 1934, the shortage of houses in Canberra was estimated at 300. People were applying for houses, and could not get them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there were thousands of men out of work, and materials were plentiful. There is a shortage of probably 500 houses in Canberra at the present time. Had things been properly managed the unemployed could have been put to work and the houses built. As it was, the unemployed went hungry, and a great many people are now homeless. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very good retort to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> whois always prepared to make a parade of the servicemen issue in the hope of gaining some political advantage. The honorable member knows that to be true. The responsibility for the present housing shortage rests, ultimately, upon the present Opposition parties, because they did nothing except talk about housing when they might have been doing something practical. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Lyons, who was then Prime Minister, said during the election campaign in 1937 that he had a plan to expend ##£##20,000,000 on home building. How many homes were built under that plan? Not one.I am not concerned with housing for returned soldiers only; I am concerned with providing houses for the whole community. This is a re-establishment bill, the purpose of which is to fit the ex-servicemen into a balanced community, and to provide them, as well as others, with decent homes. As soon as labour and materials become available it will be possible to build homes. In the report of the Social Security Committee on housing, there are references to the grave shortage of houses, and to the existence of slums in every city in Australia. The problem should have been tackled by previous governments when labour and materials were available, but little or nothing was done. The act which provided for the rehabilitation of the men who fought in the war of 1914-1918 was taken full advantage of by all who were eligible to receive war-service homes. In 1927 the Housing Act was passed, but not one house was built. Again, when the Lyons Government was in office, the sum of ##£##20,000,000 was set aside to relieve the housing shortage, but not one house was built. Consequently, there is now an acute shortage of houses for both servicemen and civilians, but until war conditions make it possible to provide labour and materials, very little can be done to relieve that shortage. </para>

                        <para>- It is useless to submit a housing programme unless something is done to give effect to it. Both the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehy)</inline> and the honorable member for Bass put their finger on the weak spot when they referred to the need to have labour and materials available for the building of houses. What is the Government doing to make labour and materials available? For two years the housing problem has grown increasingly serious, until it is now acute. Notwithstanding that about half a million men now under arms are looking forward to the day when they will return to Australia and settle in their own homes, the Government refuses every application for the release of men to provide timber, tiles, bricks, and other materials required for the building of homes. If homes are to be built, the Government will have to allocate man-power to the industries which will provide the necessary materials. If there is to be full employment after the war, men must be employed in providing the timber, roofing materials and other requisites of a national housing scheme. Unless these materials are available when the men now in the services are demobilized, tens of thousands of men will have to wait not only for homes but also for jobs. So far as the results indicate, there has been no planning by the Government. If the war with Japan were to end within six, eight or twelve months, there would be utter chaos in the building industry. When the Government is charged with being recreant to its trust in the provision of homes for the people, it falls back on the excuse that the country is still at war. That is true, but it does not absolve the Government from the necessity to take action in advance of the cessation of hostilities. It is not a satisfactory alibi to say that half a million men are in the fighting services, because large numbers of them have been doing nothing for two years at Atherton and other places in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government has no direct powers in that respect either. It did undertake to make funds available to the State Governments for the conservation of fodder, but they turned -the proposal down. That is why the fodder was not provided. The Opposition##'##s successful campaign against the transfer of certain powers to the Commonwealth has made this rather cumbersome clause necessary. He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind. ##"## As ye sow, so shall ye reap.##"## Other Government supporters have pointed out the impossibility of providing la,bour and materials for a home-building programme and at the same time wage an all-in war. I agree, with the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> that had the homes that should have been built before the war, especially during the depression, been built, the housing shortage would not have been nearly so acute to-day. Some years ago, I asked how many homes had been built under the Commonwealth housing legislation, and I was told that none had been. None have been built since. No wonder we are short of houses. This Government is not blameworthy for the position. In 1934, when I entered this Parliament, this country was in the depths of the depression, with hundreds of thousands of men workless, although  there was an abundance of credit and materials everywhere. Roth man-power and money ought to have been diverted to the provision of homes instead of being allowed to remain idle, the men drawing a  miserable dole and inadequately boused. Before the war, there was a shortage of 300 houses in Canberra, where the Commonwealth Government has complete authority. The Opposition parties neglected, when they were in power, to provide even sufficient homes for Commonwealth public servants in the Australian Capital. Then was the timo to build houses, not during the war, when we need every available man to defend this country either in battle or in production. When this Government assumed office it found that the country was in an entirely defenceless state, by reason of the inaction of the previous Government. If there are not sufficient homes available immediately after the war for the men and women who will need them, that tragedy will be due in some degree to the inactivity of the previous Government. Provision is made in the War Service Homes Act for the building of homes for soldiers, and the clause now before the committee is designed to give the Government authority to negotiate for additional homes for additional classes of people in the postwar period. </para>

                <para class="block">The discussion, however, has taken a considerably wider scope, and many matters relating to housing problems generally have been reviewed. Honorable members opposite have asserted that more houses should be available to the people. We can readily agree with that statement. They have said also that private enterprise could build houses. That might be so if the necessary building materials were available. But honorable gentlemen opposite appear to forget that we are still involved in a devastating conflict in the Pacific theatre, and much timber is still needed for war purposes. The timber industry of Australia has played a mighty part in the war effort. Millions of feet of decking has been made available, and an extraordinary quantity of other timber has also been provided for war purposes. General MacArthur has acknowledged the wonderful war effort of Australia, in which the timber workers have played a worthy part. Timber for building ships, storehouses, hutments and a hundred and one other things has been provided on an enormous scale. The railway authorities also have made heavy demands on our resources. Hostels and other establishments have been built for service personnel, and now that many more British servicemen have come here, additional demands are again being made upon our timber supplies. People who see large stacks of timber in various timber yards in the Commonwealth are apt to imagine that that timber should be released for civilian use, but practically the whole of it is awaiting shipment to some distant place for use in the war effort. A decision is necessary as to whether such supplies shall continue to be reserved wholly for war purposes in order that the war may be finished in the shortest possible time, or whether a portion of it could be released for civilian use, without damage to the war effort. I notice from##"## press reports that a re-allocation of materials and manpower has been made in the United States of America since the termination of the war in Europe. Whether such a re-allocation is desirable in Australia can be determined only by the members of the War Cabinet who have at their command the information on which alone a sound judgment can be formed. It may be that a good case can be stated for some re-allocation of man-power and supplies. </para>
                <para>With their customary ##"## nose for news ##"## the members of the Opposition have seized upon housing as a profitable subject for discussion. They know that almost every person in the community is concerned about the shortage of housing. Many people, we all know, are living in tents, or garages, or storehouses, or other unsuitable places, because they cannot  obtain bornes. We all will readily admit that everything possible should be done to ensure that homes will be available for discharged service personnel. The Government bias promised that consideration ##"##will be given to a re-allocation of man-power and materials, and I hope that this promise will be fulfilled without delay. No effort should he spared in pushing forward ##"##with an adequate housing programme. It may be that some timber supplies that are , being held for war purposes oan be released for housing, but I repeat that that decision can be made only by the War Cabinet which has a knowledge of all the facts of the war situation. Some honorable gentlemen opposite have referred to New Zealand##'##s war effort. It is true that that dominion has made a splendid war effort, but I remind the committee that General MacArthur has said that no nation in the world has made a more stupendous  Avar  effort than has Australia. No doubt New Zealand has contributed greatly to war successes, but I question whether the sister dominion has done half as much as Australia. </para>

I consider that we are producing sufficient timber, but that the allocation of it is causing a good deal of our trouble. So long as vast quantities of timber are demanded for war purposes, the shortage for civilian uses must continue. However, I appeal to the Government to review the timber situation. I understand that a serious shortage of joinery exists at present and that joinery has to be imported. Here again the war situation has to be considered, for insufficient shipping is available to transport all the joinery we need. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. I was anxious from the beginning that this hill should go through without resort, to the party tactics to which honorable members opposite have descended. I am confident that this is a. measure which will provide a fair deal for ex-servicemen of. this war. It amazes me that honorable members opposite should, in addressing themselves to clause 102 which relates to housing, have attempted to make party capital out of it. Not one honorable member opposite has placed before the committee a constructive idea on the subject. One might be pardoned for believing, while listening to them, that it was only necessary to wave a wand and thousands of houses would rise up over night. As a matter of fact, we must give the ex-servicemen economic security as well as provide them with houses. Honorable members will recall that many occupants of war service homes lost them during the period between the two wars. I am confident that the people recognize the difficulties which have confronted this Government during  the war. They realize that the Government is doing everything possible to ease the burden of the war upon them, and that it will embark upon an active housing programme as early as it can. It will be necessary to release some men from the services before the housing programme can be commenced. Moreover, while defence works are in progress, it is difficult to get materials for home building, but both labour and materials will be made available as soon as possible. We must remember that Australia is still at war. Honorable members opposite have said that in Great Britain the authorities have already embarked upon a housing programme. Such a programme is necessary in Great Britain where half the homes have been destroyed by enemy action. Moreover, with the end of hostilities in Europe, materials and labour have again become available in. Great Britain,but Australia is still actively engaged in the Pacific war, and until Japan is beaten we must devote our manpower and our resources to the prosecution of the war. Let us remember, also, that housing is not the sole responsibility of the Commonwealth Parliament. We can act only in co-operation with the States, and this limitation will continue until the Commonwealth Parliament is clothed with greater powers. Honorable members opposite have condemned the Government for the housing shortage, but the fact that there are slums in all Australian cities is largely the fault of honorable members opposite who are members of parties that were in power for most of the time that this Parliament has been in existence. </para>

                    <para>.- The purpose of this bill is to provide for the re-establishment in civil life of members of the forces, and to facilitate their employment. The bill is, therefore, foundational in character. Each of the clauaes- - and there are 135 of them altogether - contains a central point of greater or lesser importance. Clause 102, which we are now discussing, provides that the Commonwealth may enter into agreements with the States regarding the allocation of dwellings. That is a wise provision, and it is the central fact of the clause. I submit, with great respect, that a general discussion regarding war service homes would be irrelevant, as the main, point of the clause is that agreements may be made between the Commonwealth and the States for the allocation of##"## d welling houses amongst discharged members of the forces, or classes of discharged members of the forces, and other persons or classes of persons. </para>

                    <para>.-I have no desire to stone-wall the bill, but I regard this clause as of great importance. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> stated a few minutes ago that if private enterprise were given an opportunity to build houses for the people it could do so. It has had an opportunity to do that for the last 30 years, but it has not built enough of them. The lack of housing throughout Australia is featured prominently in the press, and frequent references are made to the poor quality of the houses in which many of the people have to live. The Opposition##'##s attack upon the Government in respect of its housing proposals synchronizes with an attempt by the press to belittle the Government , in its efforts to re-establish ex-servicemen! in civil life. The Government must provide a plan for the reestablishment of service men and women on their release from the fighting forces, but neither the labour nor the materials required for the building of necessary houses is available at present. Honorable members opposite may claim that thousands of men now in the services could be released for work on the home front. There are numerous armchair critics who consider that they know how the members of the forces should be employed, but we must leave the decision of that matter to those best able to make it. Whilst honorable members on both sides of the chamber recognize the disabilities imposed by war, I regret that members of the Opposition try to make party political capital out of this bill. </para>

                        <para>- My opinion is based on observations by honorable members opposite during the discussion of this measure. Owing to the defeat at the last referendum of proposals for the granting of increased powers to this Parliament, the Commonwealth cannot undertake the building of houses; but, I hope that when money is made available to the States for that purpose, the system which has operated in the past in respect of war service homes will not be perpetuated. Men who fought in t he last war have been trying for many years to discharge their liabilities in respect of their homes, and they still owe about half of the original purchase price. I hope that the money to be advanced to the States for housing will be made available at cost, so that the interest charges shall be reduced to a minimum. Since we have been able to find the money required for the manufacture of the weapons of war, we should be able to advance money at low rates of interest to those who have given invaluable service to their country in the present struggle. Ex-servicemen should not be called upon to pay more than the actual cost of the homes provided for them. It would be deplorable if they found themselves burdened with a heavy load of debtthrough the piling up of interest charges which they were unable to meet, as happened in connexion with the war service homes erected after the last war. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a provision which I have yet to see equalled. It is quite true that, under the National Security Act, power was taken to the Executive to make regulations inconsistent with other statutes. But that was for reasons of urgency, which were very well understood. Here, however, we have abill which has engaged the attention of this branch of the Legislature for some time. Almost every detail of it either has been discussed, or would have been discussed, but for the limitation of time. Therefore, to a degree at least, the bill is supposed to represent the considered judgment of this chamber. Yet the very last sub-clause of it gives to the Executive the power, at its own discretion, to alter every word of. it. As honorable members will clearly see, the Executive, whoever may compose it, in the period in question up to the end of the war, may do what it likes in regard to this statute. In other words, it may amend clause 4, dealing with definitions, by introducing within the scope of the legislation classes of people who are not now covered by it; it may, at its own sweet will, alter the conditions upon which preference shall be awarded ; it may, at its own discretion, alter all the benefits that are prescribed in the legislation. For the love of me, I cannot understand why such a power should be required.We have not been told at any stage the need for it. </para>

                        <para>- The right thing to do would be to omit sub-clause 2, because it represents the complete abandonment of parliamentary authority. I do not begin to understand how any honorable member on either side of this chamber could be prepared to say : ##"## This is the bill as it leaves our hands. It will become an Act of Parliament, representing the will of the Parliament. But you, the Executive, may now proceed to alter any or every portion of it, according to your own discretion ##"##. If that provision is to be written into the statute, then the Parliament might just as well close its doors; because, if this is to become a precedent, we shall occupy months in this place hammering out legislation, and, under this most extraordinary power, the Executive will then proceed to do exactly what it likes about it. It is all very well for the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark)</inline> to pretend to see something that is good in this provision. He knows perfectly well that, if he were a member of the Opposition, he would protest to high heaven against legislation of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I put it very strongly to the Minister, that the right thing to do is to omit sub-clause 2. I should move to do that, but that, on the failure of the amendment, there would be no capacity to amend the sub-clause. If the Minister would accept an amendment to that effect, the problem would cease to exist. But if he is determined to retain sub-clause 2, then I put it to the committee that it should be followed by a new sub-clause. My reason is that, on the language of sub-clause 2, it is highly probable - to say the least of it - that any repeal or amendment of, or addition to, any of the provisions of this act, during the war, will continue in operation after the war. The power conferred by sub-clause 2 will not cease to operate at the termination of the war, because no time limit is placed on its operation. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not propose, to omit sub-clause 2, or to accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I admit that, at first sight, sub-clause 2 appears to be rather a remarkable provision; but on further examination, it seems to me, the weight of argument is in favour of its inclusion. As the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark)</inline> has said, it would be possible to amend or repeal any portion of the act, or add to it by means of National Security regulations. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that, in my opinion, the weight of argument is in favour of the retention of this clause. This is a comprehensive measure. It is, moreover, a most complex bill; it deals with administrative affairs which have never previously been dealt with in legislation submitted to this Parliament. In .the light of experience we may find that some of its provisions will have to be altered speedily in order to meet the circumstances of the moment. We are entering upon a period when the economic conditions of this country will be in a very fluid state; they may vary from week to week. Will any honorable member say that we can now be so all-seeing, so wise, as to provide for every contingency that may arise when the demobilization of the troops takes place? Part II., Division 4, relates to ##"## Modification of Conditions of Entry to Employment##"##. In that division the Government has set out the modifications which it considers ought to be made in order that returned servicemen may be re-established quickly in certain occupations. Although the Government has tried to make the measure flexible enough to cover every contingency  that  might arise in connexion with the reestablishment of servicemen, it recognizes that circumstances which have not been foreseen but which may have to be met promptly may arise. Should the Parliament then be in recess, would it not be wise to  have  the power to alter, amend, or repeal any provisions in this bill dealing with such matters, in order that matters which need  urgent  attention may be decided speedily? </para>

We cannot accept the Minister##'##s explanation and at the same time stand up to our parliamentary responsibilities. Everything that the Minister has said regarding conditions changing before the end of the war can be met under the powers already possessed under the National Security Act. Sub-clause 1 of clause 135 covers anything that the Minister may have in mind to meet changing circumstances before the end of the war. Sub-clause 2 reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That means that any regulations made under sub-clause 2 will stand for all time as part of this act, so that there will be no need whatever for another amending bill to be introduced. Under sub-clause 2 the Minister will have power so to alter the act as to abrogate the decisions of the Parliament; and any amendments or additions which may be made will then remain in the act, and need not be ratified. If the Minister is sincere in what he has said about the intention of the Government, everything that he has in mind can be carried out under the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The only conclusion that I can come to is that the observations of the Minister have been made in an attempt to hoodwink honorable members. We have had other examples of the abrogation of the rights of the Parliament. We know that from time to time the Government has consulted outside bodies in order to obtain their permission to introduce legislation. Those bodies have been given powers greater than those of the Parliament. That was done in connexion with the legislation to extend the area in which the Australian Military Forces could serve, and also in connexion with the AustralianNew Zealand Agreement. In another respect, the present Government is trying to make Parliament merely a rubber stamp to carry out the wishes of Ministers who are overseas. Whatever preference to servicemen is contained in this legislation, it will be of no avail if we agree, to sub-clause 2. Throughout the passage of this bill the Minister has shown the same unreasonable discrimination towards ex-servicemen as he has shown, between the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> and the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> ; the former he has abused for saying things with which he did not agree, and to the latter he has given a cigar when he has supported th&lt;?

                        <para>- At the time,I thought there was provision for a penalty, but it appears that the only penalty provided for is in respect of a breach of the regulations. No law can be effective unless provision is made for its enforce: ment by a fine or imprisonment for a breach of the law. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> ought to reconsider that matter and insert, in this clause, a provision whereby the Governor-General may make regulations prescribing a fine, imprisonment or both, for a breach of the regulations or the act. Otherwise, I am sure that the preference and employment provisions will be futile. When the bill goes to The Senate a provision should be inserted, perhaps not in the words proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I also agree that sub-clause 2 is capable of the interpretation placed upon it by him. The Minister has given an assurance that regulations made under this sub-clause will be only temporary, but that promise would not be binding on another government, nor even on this Government. I do not visualize a change of government, but it is possible. It has happened. We could have an anti-Labour majority in this chamber and a Labour majority in the Senate. The Executive could then alter the preference provisions without reference to Parliament. The Minister should also give serious consideration to that. </para>

I believe first sight is the best. People claiming second-sight are called fakirs; in this sphere they could be cunning deceivers of those for whom they are legislating. I believe this clause was inserted to enable the Minister to carry out his promise to the Trade Unions convention in Melbourne that although a bill to give preference to soldiers would be passed it would be made ineffective. </para>

                <para class="block">That provision is gravely discreditable to the Parliament because the effect of it is that if a man who is seeking a reemployment allowance under this legislation happens to be receiving a military pension or a pension in relation to some disability, the amount of such pension is to be deducted from his re-employment allowance. Consequently, if the clause remains in its present form an important principle in relation to service pensions and allowances will be completely set aside. The Government may not be interested in this matter, but the people of Australia will be greatly interested to know that the Government has introduced and forced through Parliament a provision the effect of which is that, whereas allowances in respect of payments received from a trade union, or payments received from a friendly society, will not be deductible from a re-employment allowance, an allowance which an exsoldier may receive because he has suf fered some disability in the service of his country will be deductible. The limited time available does not permit me to say much on the subject, except that this is a shameful provision and that it is therefore desirable that honorable members should be tested by a division to show where they stand in relation to it. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly true, but that was not a justification for honorable gentlemen opposite repeating the same arguments over and over again. On oneoccasion at least an honorable member took his second period of fifteen minutes in committee in order to repeat the identical arguments that he had used in his first fifteen minutes. Ample time was available at an earlier stage for the consideration of this clause. However, time is short now, and in order to show the insincerity of the protestations of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter, I point out that the provisions of clause 75 of this bill are exactly the same as provisions which appear in the Australian Soldiers##'## Repatriation Act which was passed by Parliament after the last war, during the time a government supported by honorable gentlemen opposite was in power. The provision has remained in force throughout the period between the two wars. Honorable gentlemen opposite had many opportunities to alter it had they desired to do so. </para>

                        <para>.- I have the honour to belong to a profession which realizes the need for the change which the march of circumstance and the progress of invention throughout the world bring. I therefore approach the matter of banking reform in a constructive way, as I did in 1924 and 1930. The records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show how, on both of those occasions, I tried to make the proposals fit existing conditions, and prepare for the future. I regret that a decision of caucus precludes me from making my special knowledge available to the House and tha country, especially as in 1930, as the result of an interesting and constructive debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> the Labour Treasurer, accepted many of our amendments, and his bill was finally carried in this House without division on the second and third readings. </para>

                        <para>The principal obstacle in the way of such (central banking) development was the attitude towards the Commonwealth Bank of the private trading hanks. They declined to deposit any considerable portion of their reserves with it. because they realized that such reserves might be used to further its active competition with them. One cannot blame the managers and controllers of the private banking institutions for that attitude,  They  realized that in the Commonwealth Bank they had a competitor of tremendous power; and it was unreasonable to .expect them to strengthen that competitor by handing over to it large proportions of their reserves. A great many commentators on the Australian banking system have pointed out that the Commonwealth Bank cannot function properly as a central reserve bank while it is in active competition with the private banks. The present Government, recognizing this, has brought down the measure we are now discussing. </para>

                        <para>The trading banks shall deposit 10 per cent, of their demand liabilities and 5 per cent, of their time liabilities with the central reserve bank; in other words they will deposit 10 per cent, of the amount of their current accounts and 5 per cent, of the amount of their fixed deposits with it. Therefore, at the outset the central reserve bank would have a minimum reserve of approximately ##£##20,000,000, of which between ##£##16,000,000 and ##£##18,000,000 would represent deposits made by the trading banks and the balance would be made up of amounts to the credit of current accounts with the various governments doing business with the banks. The Commonwealth Bank would be included with the trading banks; the Savings Banks would not bo so included. The Commonwealth Bank will be under exactly the same obligation as the other trading banks to keep a proportion of its reserves with the central bank. </para>

                    <para>At this stage of world affairs, there is no place in the Commonwealth or any other parliament for the old ##"##Back to 1912 Brigade##"##, or in this discussion for the old Labour lie that my reforms in 1924, which increased the powers, functions and strength of the Commonwealth Bank, ruined it. There may be a place for this brigade in our lunatic asylums with those who converse with reincarnated Napoleons, Caesars and Queen Besses, or on the Yarra bank, or in the Sydney Domain. </para>
                    <para>The figures which illustrate the growth of the ##'##Commonwealth Bank prove that the charge that it was destroyed by the Bruce-Page Government, when it was given central banking powers and functions, is unfounded##'##. The belated conversion of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to my view of the necessity for a strong central bank is seen in the statement in his speech, ##"## The principal function of the Commonwealth Bank must be to fulfil its responsibilities and duties as a central bank ##"##. The first sentence of the explanatory memorandum of the Treasurer is - ##"## The main purposes of the bill are (a) To strengthen the central banking functions of the bank.##"##. Shades of the stalwart Labour opposition of 1924 will arise from their graves, since their whole contention was - as Labour propaganda has been ever since - that the Commonwealth Bank was destroyed by being given central banking functions. The fact is that it has not since ceased to grow. It is the most active ##"## destroyed ##"## creature that I have ever seen. In truth, it is a very lusty, growing child as these figures show - </para>
                    <para>The Rural Credits Department, which I established in 1925, had lent ##£##125,000,000 for the orderly marketing of primary products until the beginning of this war, and the department has since advanced an additional ##£##225,000,000 for this purpose. Another measure of vitality is the fact that, whereas in the last war *the Commonwealth Bank acted as agent for the Government to raise ##£##18S,000,000 in loans, in this war it has raised over ##£##1,500,000,000 by means of loans, treasury-bills, and advances. In fact, the board created by me has, during the present war, earned the highest praise from the Government for the manner in which it has discharged its obligations. It has met the wishes of the Government 100 per cent, and, in grateful thanks, is now having its head cut off. </para>
                    <para>I had better nail down, at once, the lie that the Commonwealth Bank, in some mysterious way, by manipulating the note issue, enabled the trans-Australian railway to be built and most other public works in Australia to be carried out, with money obtained free of interest. The stark fact is that, until I gave the Commonwealth Bank Board control of the note issue in 1924, the ##'##Commonwealth Bank had nothing whatever to do with the note issue, which was entirely .controlled by the Treasurer. The Treasury control of the note issue in Labour banking legislation was always a sore point with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O##'##Malley, who fought strenuously against it, and for its transfer to the Commonwealth Bank. This legislation, in effect, gives to the Treasurer practically complete and sole control of the note issue. </para>
                    <para>The history of the Commonwealth Bank,##'## the actual statements of the Treasurer in introducing this bill, and authoritative figures dispose completely of the Labour parrot cry that the abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and unfettered political control of the note issue and of banking by the Government, would prevent all monetary ills. </para>
                    <para>Immediately after the last war, when the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of a Governor, and the note issue was in the hands of the Treasurer, Australia passed through two very acute periods of monetary tension in quick suc cession. Although money was not particularly hard to obtain, in Australia in 1920, this country, with large commitments to meet in Britain, found that it had to pay an excessive amount to remit money, and, in many cases, it was impossible to effect remittances at all. Our credit was seriously impaired, and it was difficult to get the equipment necessary to rehabilitate the country and build up new industries. In 1922, while there was still a Governor in sole control of the Commonwealth Bank, the exchange position was entirely reversed. It became impossible to transfer to Australia moneys realized by the sale of Australian products abroad, or moneys raised abroad for Australian development. The money market became so tight in Australia that it was very hard to get money for desirable purposes. The rate of interest for governmental loans greatly increased, and, automatically, the rate of interest on private loans also increased. The reason for the changes which I made in 1924 with regard to the Commonwealth Bank and its control was to give to the bank power to overcome such difficulties in the future. . This it has done very ably, in all the circumstances which it had to meet. The recorded facts of history show that those reforms of 1924 enabled the immediate crisis to be handled, ensured expansion of the Commonwealth Bank itself, and strengthened the whole banking structure into a symmetrical, and well-balanced system of central banking, without interfering with existing functions of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                    <para>Those reforms substituted for one-man control the management by an independent board, its members retiring on a seven-years##'## rotation plan, were drawn from all representative interests in the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Bank was made the keystone of the financial arch of Australia and the pivot of Australian banking by making it a bank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange and reserve. To this end the note issue was, for the first time, placed under the control of the board of the bank. The board was given power to fix and publish its discount rate. The Commonwealth Bank was given resources to make this discount rate effective by the  legal provision that all banks should use the Commonwealth Bank as a clearing house and settle all balances between them by cheques drawn on the Commonwealth Bank. This necessitated every bank keeping cash funds with the Commonwealth Bank. These to-day total over ##£##200,000,000. The capital of the bank was, at that time, increased to ##£##20,000,000. All banks were required to furnish full statistics on a uniform basis to the Commonwealth authority. The bills now before the Parliament maintain all these reforms, except that of an independent board. This the Treasurer replaces by an advisory council completely subservient to the government of the day and at the same time makes other dangerous changes. </para>
                    <para>The parrot cry of the Labour party over the last twenty years has been that the trading banks have strangled the Commonwealth Bank. The manner in which this alleged strangulation has taken place by the trading banks putting their funds in increasing amounts on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank illustrates that it has been an internal rather than an external process. In 1923, private individuals had ##£##9,500,000, the trading banks ##£##5,882,000 and State and Federal Governments ##£##14,000,000 on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank. In 1944, the position of the Commonwealth Bank was that private depositors had ##£##136,000,000, the trading hanks ##£##223,000,000, and governments ##£##219,000,000 on deposit. Whereas, immediately prior to the passage of the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1924, the trading banks##'## deposits were the smallest of the three types of deposits, to-day they are the greatest. Throughout the war, the trading banks have given 100 per cent, co-operation to the Government. They have made a special voluntary arrangement to limit their profits and to freeze in the Commonwealth Bank special deposits due to increased war expenditure, as was set out in the Fadden budget of 1941. This voluntary arrangement was afterwards incorporated in a National Security Regulation .by the present Government, to make the voluntary act of the trading banks look as if it had been done under duress. For this good work and 100 per cent, co-operation, the trading banks also are to have their heads cut off by the Government##'##s legislation in grateful thanks. </para>
                    <para>In this debate I shall try to propose reforms that will ensure progress over the next twenty years. But before dealing with any change at all, I should like to make this point : In this distressed world, with so many things hopelessly out of joint, it is wise and prudent <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> hold firmly to those organizations which have functioned, or are functioning well, and to concentrate our energies on reforming those aspects of our political and economic machinery which are obviously not working satisfactorily. Our banking machinery has operated very well during the strain of war years. Therefore, revolutionary change is not indicated by the facts of the case. The Commonwealth Bank already belongs, and has always belonged, to the people. All of the arguments of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> on this point are therefore wide of the issues of this bill. Those issues are whether the people, through their parliamentary representatives, should determine the control and policy of the Commonwealth Bank by a proper legal charter, or whether .the Government of the day should be a##'##ble to over-ride its control and determine its policy at the changing whim of caucus. Before dealing in detail with the proposed changes, I wish to state as I shall later show, that the changes provided for in the banking measures now before the Parliament, go far beyond changes of mere banking structure. They threaten the lives and liberties of present and future generations and the future of our representative institutions. </para>
                    <para>The war has taught Australia that it needs more people for its defence and security. At the very least 20,000,000 people are required to hold this country. From where shall we get them? Our natural increase is not enough. Statisticians say that we shall be fortunate if Australia gets an extra million people in the next 30 years from its natural increase. Therefore, we must attract migrants in order to obtain the additional 12,000,000 we need. Migrants will be attracted only if amenities are offered to them equal  to those they now enjoy. The provision of such amenities involves expenditure of large sums of money. I pointed out in Parliament a few weeks ago the need for the expenditure in the next ten years of at least ##£##100,000,000 on a continuous programme of electricity and water supplies. This expenditure must be additional to ordinary expenditure by governments on housing, schools, hospitals, railways, and other similar services. Australia can get money sufficient for all these purposes only if we have a continuous, settled financial policy that would give confidence both to local and overseas investors. Confidence is, and must always be, the ultimate basis of all borrowing. Changes in our monetary system should, therefore, be gradual and evolutionary, not revolutionary. They should be based on reason and experience, not on catch or parrot cries, or twenty years##'## old prejudices. </para>
                    <para>The necessity for changes should be shown clearly and unmistakably before being made. The changes should conform, if possible, with standards generally recognized throughout the countries from which we hope to get people and capital investments. I am disappointed that, in his second-reading speech, the Treasurer did not tell the Parliament and the country the whole story of war finance in Australia. This story would have shown how the present financial system had stood up to that strain and the defects that became evident. By such a story, he might have been able to give some justification for changes in our banking system. When I reformed the Commonwealth Bank in 1924, I gave its history in both war and peace finance. I gave instances showing where the system had worked well and of where the system had broken down, and I gave reasons for the changes I made. These changes, according to the Treasurer##'##s quotation of my 1924 speech, established banking practice in Australia for the last 21 years. That policy enabled, by the confidence thus engendered, a huge monetary war effort to be made that challenges comparison, relatively, with that of any other country. Now, without any valid reason, the Treasurer abandons principles which have hitherto been universally recognized as essential to the maintenance of confidence, and seeks to establish a political financial dictatorship outside the control of Parliament. Here are four examples of this - </para>

On this council the governor, though chairman, has no vote; but, when a policy has been determined by its expert opinion, the Treasurer may direct a reversal of that policy without bringing either his direction or the reasons for this extraordinary action before Parliament in any way. Surely, when the Government insists so much on the value of expert control in these highly technical and important matters, the Treasurer should be compelled, before any change is made, to bring down for the consideration of the Parliament, both his direction and the reasons that impelled him to jettison his own appointees##'## advice.

The Government has taken into a garage its banking motor car needing slight repairs, such as the fixing of the wind-screen wiper, and brings out the car with its foot and hand brakes taken away, as well as all the low gears, and with the throttle of the accelerator bent so that the car can travel only at full speed ahead, in top gear, with the engine racing towards the abyss of destruction. </para>

In war-time, or in periods of acute emergency, temporary provisions of this nature may be necessary, but they should be brought in by special legislation. These provisions are now proposed to operate in peace-time. The changes made by this legislation are successive steps that can lead to inflation without any parliamentary control to check them. The establishment of this political fiscal dictatorship will place at the unrestrained whim of the government of the day, not merely the taxes levied on the people of Australia, but also the savings of every individual wherever deposited - either in government or private banks. </para>
                    <para>Through the Treasurer, caucus, dominated by the outside organizations of its militant trade unions, can direct the investment of these deposits; can determine the industries in which they are employed, and, then, by an embargo on imports and exports essential to the progress of these industries, can, if it so desires, through outside influence and behind the back of Parliament, destroy those industries. </para>
                    <para>By the removal of the existing limitation on the note issue, for which the bill provides, the Government declares, in effect, that the sky is to be the limit. The Treasurer is to be given complete authority in this regard. He can override the decision of Parliament. There is to be no limit to the note issue and no reserve against the notes issued. Thus there will be no obstacle to inflation. </para>
                    <para>Let us look at these steps in their order : The first is the abolition of an independent Commonwealth Bank Board. The constitution of this board ensured continuity of a banking policy arrived at after consideration of the widest points of view. This was secured by two features of the board. The first was that the board consisted of the Governor of the bank, the Secretary of the Treasury and six other members appointed for their special knowledge of agriculture, manufacture, industry and finance. The second feature was that those members were each appointed for seven years, but their terms of office did not coincide - each one retiring in a separate year. This arrangement gave an opportunity of appointing first-class men to the board, ensured representation of very widespread interest, secured continuity of policy, and ensured that any radical change of outlook of the board must - as the Constitution provides a general election every three years - be voted on ##'##by the people as a whole before being permanently adopted. </para>
                    <para>During the 21, years that the Commonwealth Bank Board has been in existence, the appointments to it have been so satisfactory, that governments of various political complexions have consistently re-appointed members of the board  originally appointed by preceding governments. Thus, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,</inline> originally appointed by the Scullin Government, was twice re-appointed by succeeding governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Claude</inline> Reading and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson were also re-appointed for further terms. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to eliminate this board, not on the ground of its inefficiency, or because it has not done a good job - the Government admits that it has done an efficient and patriotic job and has met the wishes of the Government on matters of major policy - but on the extraordinary ground of difficulty in finding suitable appointees in the future##'##. In place of the board, the control of the hank will be in the hands of a Governor and an advisory council consisting of the  Deputy  Governor, and .Secretary of the Treasury, two other public servants and two nominees of the bank. That is to say, it narrows its choice of persons available to fill the position of directing the bank to servants and members of the staff of the Commonwealth Bank instead of availing itself of the most suitable members of the community. Both the Governor and the  Deputy  Governor are to be appointed by the Treasurer. They will have no security of tenure. They should, at least, have as secure a .tenure of office as have judges. The advisory council is to be composed entirely of public servants or bank officers who will be entirely dependent on the Treasurer for their promotion and the success of their careers. On this extraordinary advisory council, the Governor will not have a vote. He, apparently, cannot be trusted. The Governor is to be a dog which the Treasurer wall keep to bark, while he does the barking himself. The subordination of the Governor to the Treasurer is more explicitly set out in clauses 9, 22 and 27 of the bill. Clause 0 sets out that ##"## The bank shall, from time to time, inform the Treasurer of its monetary and banking policy##"##. An endeavour will be made to reach agreement. If unable to reach an agreement, the Treasurer may inform the bank that the Government will accept responsibility for adoption by the bank of the Government##'##s policy, and the bank shall then give effect to that policy. To ensure that the Governor shall be in the pocket of the Treasurer, clause 27 provides that ##"## The Secretary of the Department of the Treasury and the Governor shall establish a close liaison and shall keep each other fully informed on all matters which jointly concern the Department of the Treasury and the bank##"##. The Secretary of the Treasury also will have a seat on the advisory council. </para>
                    <para>The importance of this close liaison and the effect of this political control are especially significant in connexion with the abdication of parliamentary control of the monetary and fiscal policy of Australia, including the prohibition of the importation or exportation of goods. Clause 29 of the Banking Bill sets out, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is to say, the Treasurer can, without reference to the Parliament at all, impose import and export embargoes at his sweet will. Surely, any emergency sufficiently great to necessitate the exercise of this extraordinary power  which  may destroy whole businesses, or even whole industries, not solely amongst Australian citizens but also in friendly trading countries, is sufficiently great to justify the immediate calling together of Parliament to ratify such action. </para>
                    <para>During the depression,  extraordinry  action in Parliament was taken by the Commonwealth Government in this connexion. Under the exercise of the tariffmaking power, a tariff schedule or an embargo operates immediately it is laid upon the table of Parliament, so that no time is lost in bringing it into effect. The time necessary to prepare and adjust in the Treasury or the bank such drastic proposals cannot be less if they are to be imposed sanely and wisely than the time necessary to summon Parliament. In f act, in times of such emergencies, Parliament should be sitting continuously. </para>
                    <para>Associated with this extraordinary power for the Treasurer to act behind the back of Parliament, is the policy which provides for his indirect control of the advances by the Commonwealth Bank and of each trading bank. This power not only determines the general policy of advances, but may also direct the class of purpose for which advances may, or may not, be made by banks. Despite the. Treasurer##'##s statement that he is trying elsewhere in the Banking Bill to protect depositors, this legislation gives to the Government of the day, control of the deposits of individuals whether they be placed in the Commonwealth Bank, government, banks, or private banks. Insofar as deposits in the Commonwealth Bank are concerned, they are to be controlled by the Governor who, in turn, will be controlled by the Treasurer. He is controlled by labour caucus which, in turn, is controlled by outside trade union organizations and executives. Under this power, the deposits of private banks also, are at the mercy of the Commonwealth Bank and the same string of controllers. After this legislation is passed the control will be in the hands of those whom I have mentioned, without reference to Parliament. It surely is an anomaly that the individual savings of the people should thus be placed at the mercy of extra-parliamentary control when the Constitution provides that the expenditure of revenue obtained from taxes and loans raised by the Government must, in the last analysis, be controlled by the vote of Parliament. Under this legislation, the savings of the people are to be placed in a much worse position, insofar as control by the owners is concerned, than the taxes which the same people have paid, the control of which has passed from them. The Banking Bill specifically removes from the control of the trading banks, in the special accounts section, the control and use of approximately ##£##200,000,000 of deposits which the customers of trading banks have lodged in the course of their ordinary business. </para>
                    <para>Before dealing with the Government##'##s justification for this second form of control of the trading banks, I wish to mention the next step towards the danger of inflation in the elimination of any limit to the amount of the note issue, or any reserve of gold or sterling, or other in-  ternational  exchange value for the note issue. Insofar as the issue of notes is concerned, the Government has said that the sky is the limit. The amount ot currency is to be entirely at the direction of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who will be under the special political control of the Treasurer for that particular purpose. Most central banks have some form of limitation of the issue of notes. Sometimes it is an upper limit above which the Government and the Governor cannot go without special enabling legislation. That was suggested by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. Most countries, however, provide for a fractional reserve of gold or sterling, or something that can be converted into international exchange, which determines the total volume of the currency that can be issued. </para>
                    <para>When the Commonwealth Bank was constituted, every ##£##1 note had to be backed by a gold sovereign. Then the backing became one gold sovereign for every four ##£##1 notes. Later it was changed to provide that the reserve could be either sterling or gold, or very liquid securities of international standing. In future there will be neither limit above nor reserve beneath our note issue. Therefore, there is no real obstacle to any measure of note inflation that may be desired by the government of the day without reference to Parliament. </para>
                    <para>Two proposals in this legislation are pertinent to this position. They are, first, the statutory establishment of these special ##'## accounts in their present form and amount, and secondly, the grouping together, under the control of the Governor, of a central reserve bank, the general trading banks, the Rural Credits and Mortgage Departments and the Savings Bank. Though the Industrial Finance Department is to be placed under a general manager, to be appointed by the Treasurer, the Commonwealth Bank will be given power to make advances to the Industrial Finance Department up to ##£##1,000,000, and the Savings Bank to be permitted, under clause 98 of this bill, to make unlimited advances to the Industrial Finance Department, according to the decree of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. As regards the grouping of all these banking establishments under the direct or indirect control of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I have only this to say: That, if it were difficult, as the Treasurer says, to find among men engaged in manufacture, agriculture, finance, and commerce, six men qualified to co-operate in the management and direction of the Commonwealth Bank, it must be a much more difficult task to find a super-man capable of carrying such a terrific load for he must handle fluid, semi-fluid, long term, and short-term securities, and control the central bank and all these other subsidiaries, or excrescences. </para>
                    <para>The reason given by the Treasurer for impounding the special deposits of the trading banks to the amount of 200,000,000 is that if they are not frozen and controlled by the central bank, their use will rapidly lead to inflation. Ko provisionals made in the legislation, however, to prevent the central bank from lending these huge frozen deposits of the trading banks to its fresh rivals in the field, the Industrial Finance Department, and the general trading section. The position is roughly this : The deposits are now used by the Government, and the Commonwealth Bank would hold treasury bills and Government bonds against them. When they are being repaid the logical way out for the Commonwealth Bank would be to sell Government securities in the open market to the amount to which withdrawals are made. That would extinguish bank deposits to approximately the same amount and would be a powerful brake on any inflationary tendency. The only other way would be to issue new currency, either notes or bank deposits to the amount of the withdrawals, or a portion of that amount, which would obviously be inflationary. The only reason for such action would be to leave the bond market free for new government loans. The whole matter, therefore, resolves itself into the question of whether the Government and private enterprise can both get their requirements in the post-war period and, if not, whether the Government should have priority over private enterprise. Priority over investable funds is an easy method of security priority over labour and raw material resources. The deposits do in fact provide a neat piece of machinery for freezing out private enterprise. That appears to be the Government##'##s reason foi instituting this form of control which will enable it to have a free market for the large expenditure apparently contemplated in the post-war period. As soon as the war is over and it becomes possible to obtain all the commodities now unprocurable because of rationing and war-time shortages and conditions, there must be some expansion of trade, expansion of deposits and expansion of advances. If, as this legislation indicates, the deposits and corresponding advances of the trading ##'##banks are to be fixed at the 1939 level, other governmental institutions must supply the urgent need for accommodation. In other words they will provide it from the money of the depositors of the trading banks which has been deposited with the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that a government trading bank alongside private trading banks provides a good check on private trading banks and, converse^-, that private trading banks provide a good check on a government trading bank. </para>
                    <para>Banking practice universally applies three criteria to determine a credit-worthy borrower. These three standards are  (1) The personal factor; (2) the potentialities of the enterprise; and (3) the security offered. The order of these three principles is important. Most bankers would agree with the order I have named. Some might feel inclined to give the first two equal importance, or perhaps, even put the potentialities of the enterprise before the personal factor, but all would put the security offered in the third place. The reason is very obvious. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> bank which cherishes its reputation cares to be associated with foreclosures. The security is taken in case of accident, since banks must protect their assets in the interests of their depositors, but no bank wants to take over a security - its work is not to run a business or property, but to lend money. Unfortunately, in any government trading bank, and this would apply both to the general trading bank and the Industrial Finance Department, the government servant is not so free as is the servant of  a ##'##private institution to discriminate between borrowers on the basis of personal factors. In a government institution a definite rule must be laid down insofar as the margin of security is concerned. It will be noticed that in practically all of the Government##'##s banking legislation, as in the Mortgage Department of the Commonwealth Bank or in connexion with housing, a definite margin is stated in the law. No servant of a government bank can afford to give one man an 80 per cent, advance because he thinks well of his personal character or business capacity, and another, with the same security, only 50 per cent. There would immediately be suggestions of political partisanship or favouritism. This aspect does not arise in the case of private banks. They must take their losses with a grin and bear them. Losses of a public institution ultimately become known to the public. This difference tends towards rigidity. I feel that a governmental institution, by reason of its tax-free capital and its immunity fromtaxation generally, is already placed in a sufficiently favorable position <inline font-style="italic">vis-a-vis</inline> trading banks to overcome this handicap. Competition by trading banks after allowing for this preferential position for the government institution, will be all to the good of the community and will keep all banks, whether governmental or private, alert to the needs of the nation. If I had time, I would show how much less generous this measure is with regard to the use of savings bank and rural credits department funds than the existing legislation, but I shall deal with that in committee. </para>
                    <para>Therefore, I urge the Government to turn from the reactionary path it is taking; to retain the liberality of existing measures; to preserve the machinery which has stood so well the test of war strains; to carry out in war-time only those reforms which experience shows are urgently necessary; to maintain the supremacy of Parliament over policy; to avoid placing too tight a legislative strait-jacket on our monetary system; and to allow sufficient elasticity for its evolution along the lines our national genius may lead. </para>

What the Government proposes to do is what all those who voted ##"##Labour##"## at the last general elections expect it to do, namely, commence to implement its financial policy. I find myself in the position where I must heartily support this measure and the Banking Bill, but that does not mean that I am not somewhat disappointed that the Government is not prepared to go much farther in the implementing of that policy than is provided for in these measures. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and his colleagues have claimed that they are not concerned about the shareholders in the private banks, and that what they were concerned about is the effect that this legislation will have on the people. The Leader of the Opposition having impressed that upon the House, then devoted his whole time to telling us how unfairly we were treating the private banks, and that we were forcing them out of operation by a process of strangulation. I do not desire to spend much time replying to the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> for it is sufficient to say that those who read his speech will know why one of his colleagues called him ##"## the tragic Treasurer ##"##. However, the right honorable gentleman did refer to the Atlantic Charter, and it is significant that his only reference to it was that it provided for freedom of trade amongst the countries of the world. He said that by the use of##&gt;## these powers the Government might strangle trade and make it impossible for the terms of the Atlantic Charter to be adhered to. The Atlantic Charter contains other provisions. It provides that the peoples of the world shall be given freedom from want and freedom from fear. Those two provisions can not be implemented in this country unless the democratically elected Government of Australia has the power to determine financial policy in order that it may make possible a policy of full employment. Early in the war, the Menzies Government, which had left this country defenceless, wanted the  workers to respond to the call to arms and to make great sacrifices. That Government promised that in return for those sacrifices we were to have a new order when the war ended. In a speech early in the war, the right honorable gentleman said that he did not expect that we should ever return to the conditions that had existed before the war. Members of the Opposition have now forgotten those promises and have rallied at the call of their real masters to protect the citadel of reaction. They are -citing all the terrible deeds that the Government could do if it misused the powers that it proposes to take under these measures. ##"##We could do terrible things under legislation already on the statute-book if we desired, hut we do not. What we desire to do is to use our powers beneficially for the people. We want to ensure that members of the forces when they are demobilized and workers in war industries when they are discharged shall have, not so much the preference that the Parliament has been debating during recent weeks, and which will be unnecessary, but the right to full employment. The right to live entails the right to work.  That is why we need this banking legislation. Honorable gentlemen opposite have argued that economic security cannot be obtained by financial reform alone. We admit that, but economic security in this country cannot be obtained without financial reform. The Government, therefore, must be placed in a position to implement its financial and economic policy. I agree with one point that the Leader of the Opposition made, though I do not consider that he really believed it. The right honorable gentleman said that these bills should be examined in order to ascertain the effect that they would have on the Australian public. It is wise, at this point, however, to examine the state of affairs in this country and throughout the world prior to the war, in order to see whether this great banking machine that honorable gentlemen say so much about, w.as really acting efficiently and achieving the results that the people desire. No one can but admit that the problem of world starvation prior to the outbreak of the war was a problem not of production but of distribution*. We do not desire to return to the days when some people in different parts of the world welcomed droughts, blights upon the land, and misery among the people, because these conditions ensured the disposal of past surplus production on the world##'##s market. </para>

So we find that the right honorable member for Cowper was a great advocate of the International Wheat Agreement under which the acreage sown to wheat in this country, and in other parts of the world, was- restricted at a time when millions of people were starving or in want.

                    <para>What is wrong with those general principles ? What the Government is proposing, in fact, is that, in order to develop this country by the full use of its natural resources, they shall be responsible for financial policy. According to the Leader of the Opposition that is all wrong, and that no change of control is necessary or advisable, but the right honorable gentleman supported his case by only one authority, and not a very good one at that. I shall give a few authorities to support the argument for a new financial system. The late President Wilson admitted, in 1911, that ##"##financiers are more powerful than the nominal rulers##"##. Many years ago Meyer Rothschild, father of the House of Rothschild, who founded the great chain of Jewish banking houses, the most powerful financial empire the world has ever known, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Already in England, whilst the Pacific war is still being waged, workers are demonstrating against unemployment. The conservatives in the House of Commons, like the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and other honorable gentlemen in this chamber, are saying to the workers, ##"##Well, you have had a very good spin over the last few years ##"## thus indicating that conservatives in this country, as well as abroad, can see ahead only greater depressions, greater armies of unemployed and misery and degradation for the workers. It is to prevent that kind of thing that the Government is seeking to implement its banking policy. </para>
                    <para>It is true that the abolition of the Commonwealth Bank Board is provided for in this bill. Honorable gentlemen opposite say, ##"## That is to establish political control ##"##. I deny that statement. The Commonwealth Bank Board was established by the right honorable member for Cowper, who having once tried with the utmost of his power to cripple, destroy and restrict the operations of the bank, has now become its champion. In our opinion the board has operated to the detriment of the people. Following the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board in 1924, the rates of interest for the financing of primary production began to rise. In the 1924-25 season, the primary producers had to pay ##£##7,000.000 in bank charges, compared with ##£##3,000,000 in the previous season, which preceded the establishment of the board. The farmers of Western Australia formed a voluntary pool and made an unsuccessful application for financial assistance to the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. The private banks wanted to impose impossible conditions upon them. Eventually, financial accommodation was secured from the Co-operative Wholesale Society of England, which paid the money to the London branch of the Commonwealth Bank. That bank arranged with the private banks for its transmission to Australia. The cost of shipping 4,000,000 bushels of wheat to England was approximately ls. a bushel, yet for merely transmitting this money from England to Australia the charges of the private banks were equivalent to 3##£##d. a bushel, or a total of ##£##60,000. Yet the right honorable member for Cowper would try to convey the impression that the Commonwealth Bank Board has been responsible for assisting the people of this country, including the primary producers whom he claims to represent in this Parliament! In 1936, when the private banks raised the interest rates on fixed deposits, similar action was taken almost immediately by the Commonwealth Bank, under the direction of the board. Regarding that incident, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the 25th March, 1936, had this to say - </para>

The weakness is due directly to the present federal Ministry##'##s abdication of its power and evasion of its responsibility. </para>

                    <para class="block">It should be clear that the decision of the present Government to abolish the Commonwealth Bank Board is a wise one. Let me remind the right honorable member for Cowper of what that, board did as late as 1940. The Sydney Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Boardwas then carrying out very important works, and needed financial aid in order to continue them, but the Commonwealth Bank, under the direction of the bankboard, turned it down. Some very caustic comment was made on that action. One newspaper commented - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Com mon wealth Bankhas refused the Water Board##'##s request for overdraft accommodation of ##£##500,000. Works such as Warragamba and the southern and western suburbs sewer may have to close down. </para>
                        <para>The Commonwealth Bank will give overdrafts to new industries, and to businessmen not nearly so secure as the board. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It will thus be seen that while the Commonwealth Bank Board was refusing to make advances for national works, it was prepared to grant financial accommodation to undertakings that were not half so secure. It has been argued that the Commonwealth Bank must be under the control of experts. When members of the Commonwealth Bank Board were appointed, they were transferred from commerce and industry, and had had no practical experience of banking operations. According to honornable members opposite, they immediately became banking experts. Let us consider some of the predictions of ##"##alleged##"## financial experts in the past in order to measure their judgment in financial matters; It will be remembered that for years so-called financial experts and economists assured us that Germany could not finance a. major conflict and that Italy was certain to be crippled financially by its Abyssinian adventure. History has, unfortunately, shown how untrue this proved to be. When trade slumps and there is a depression, the economic wizards say that theunemployed constitute a tremendous problem. While they are talking in terms of. doles and relief work, war breaks out, and there is no longer talk of a money shortage. It is ridiculous to say that the contention that the Commonwealth Government should be responsible for financial policy is unsound and, in practice, would prove to be injurious to the pepole of this country. Opposition members argue that under this legislation the Governor of the bank will be subject to the domination of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Treasurer, who, in turn, will be subject to the domination of the Government caucus. All that I can say to the people of. this country is that a Labour government is a democratic body elected! upon a popular franchise and, therefore, it merely gives expression to the will of the people. By way of comparison, let us examine the history of the negotiations which the party opposite has conducted with the private banks. I recall that in 1938 it brought down in this Parliament a banking measure which was suddenly dropped. It was supposedly a measure to give effect to certain recommendations of the royal commission that had been appointed in. 1935 to inquire into the monetary and banking systems in this country. The then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> had a secret meeting, not with the elected representatives of the people, but with private bankers. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 31st March, had to say - </para>

                    <para>Yet objection is taken to the present Labour Government conferring with the members of its own party who are elected representatives of the people, before deciding the form of its legislation! They raised no objection to a government of their own political colour discussing with private bankers and financial institutions amendments which it proposed to make to the banking- law. That there was some basis for the fear then expressed by Labour members is shown by this statement which was published by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on the 7th April of that year - </para>

                    <para>The members of that Cabinet were prepared to amend their legislation at the behest of those in control of the private financial institutions of this country. The private banks have recently indulged in a good deal pf propaganda, with the object of arousing in the minds of the people the fear that in some way this measure will be used against their interests. Fortunately, there are some persons in responsible positions who are not falling for that propaganda. The Archbishop of Perth is reported to have said - </para>

But that power is to-day vested somewhere, and if it is not to be placed in the hands of the Government, is there not the admission that it is possessed by those who control the private banks of this country? The Leader of the Opposition skipped over the 1893 hank crisis, but it is important to examine how the private banks treated their depositors in this period. He tried to excuse the failure of the private hanks and their subsequent actions by saying, ##"## We have gone a long way since then. We had no central ##'##bank at that time ##"##. He tried to show that what happened in 1893 could not happen now. The theme of the opening portion of his speech was the fact that the depositors and the public must be protected. But what were the reconstruction plans of the private banks in 1S93? The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems made no close examination of this problem. It mainly provided statistical data, but in paragraph 216 of its report it stated - </para>

There was much similarity between the proposals made by the banks, though naturally they varied in detail. In some instances depositors were given an option to convert part of their deposits into preference shares, and in others were compelled to do so. Deposit receipts were issued for the balance. These were payable by annual or half-yearly instalments, the first in most instances about five years after the date of reconstruction or re-arrangement. </para>

In effect, this converted them into fixed capital, entitled only to a low rate of interest. The conditions described are open to adverse criticism on the ground of rigidity. The rate fixed may have been fair at the time and in the circumstances, but it became definitely  inequitable  in later years when higher rates of interest prevailed and the banks concorned earned large profits. </para>

                        <para>Of the banks which closed their doors, three did not open for business. Those that did open again suffered a varying fortune. Some were able to pay off depositors within two years, others were not so fortunate as this and did not shake off the burden for some years. The National Bank of Australia Limited managed to be free by 1000. But the majority of the  banks  found that they had overestimated their earning capacity and had to seek modified schemes of arrangement from their creditors (depositors). Quite a different type of modified scheme was sought by the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited. Realizing, in June, 1896, that it could not fulfil the terms of its original scheme of reconstruction, the repayment of deposits was reduced, the calls on shareholders were deferred, and a new company, called the Assets Trust, was formed to liquidate the assets of the bank. </para>

                    <para>I shall now deal with one or two of the reconstruction arrangements following the closure of a number of private banks in 1893, and whose failure was not as the result of government interference, because on that occasion it was only action on the pant of certain of the State Governments which prevented the complete collapse of the financial system. The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited had current and fixed deposits amounting to ##£##10,000,000. That bank suspended payment in April, 1893, and remained closed for over a month. The sum of ##£##3,000,000 was impounded and capitalized in the form of preference shares. Deposit receipts were issued for the balance. The customers were promised a gradual repayment of the deposit receipts, but it was not until 1914 that all deposits were finally paid. Some of the depositors were waiting for their own  money  for 21 years ! During that period, overdrafts were called up and the banks went into possession of some very valuable properties. The market conditions were such that it was not possible to make sales at a figure which would clear the overdrafts. .Seized properties were held by a company called the Assets Trust, until the market conditions improved. When values recovered and sales were effected, hig sums of money were realized upon these properties, but the dispossessed borrower from the bank got none of it. </para>
                    <para>The National Bank of Australasia Limited, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> is chief manager, and who has been voluble in his condemnation of the Government##'##s proposals, suspended operations in 1893, and its scheme of reconstruction provided for ##£##306,000 of depositors##'## money to be capitalized in the form of preference shares, deposit receipts to be issued for the balance. I understand that the hank still holds the amount of deposits converted to preference shares, so that that hank has not paid to the depositors the money they had entrusted to it when the bank closed its doors in 1893. </para>

Deposit receipts were issued for the balance. In 1896 the bank, which, has an English registration, was able to get sufficient influence in London to have a special act passed in the British Parliament reducing the interest payable on the perpetual inscribed stock from 4-J per cent, to 3 per cent. Efforts have been made from time to time to secure a more equitable adjustment, but the London directors qf the bank resisted the agitation and the Australian dispossessed depositors got nowhere. For many years this bank paid its London shareholders dividends ranging from 10 to 12$ per cent., whilst retaining compulsorily the deposits of its Australian customers and paying them an average interest rate of 3^ per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> J.

As a matter of fact, the Labour party and the Labour government of New South Wales which was in power at that time have nothing to be ashamed of in connexion with the closing of that bank. It was due to political agitation by anti-Labour interests, which were prepared to sacrifice the depositors for party advantage.

                        <para>By 1930 I had assets worth almost ##£##30,000. My liabilities were ##£##14,000. But the farm was paying well, prices were satisfactory, and ##[## was quite satisfied of my solvency. </para>
                        <para>I had a property of 1,035 acres in the Wellington district freehold and Court of Probate title of which 400 acres was under wheat, 10 acres under lucerne, and the balance of excellent grazing country. It was valued at ##£##5 10s. an acre and on it I had a comfortable little home. In Wellington itself, 1 built up a large garage, one of the largest ir the central west. The building and plant was valued at ##£##5,800. Then, with the depression sales fell off, so I borrowed everything that I could, to keep my business going. </para>
                        <para>I went to my bank manager. Previously he had urged me to accept an overdraft, so that I might extend my business. By 1930 that overdraft amounted to approximately ##£##2,500, but it was well covered by my assets. But now the depression was on us and the bank was a different proposition. It slogged me day after day. 1 realized on everything 1. could, and reduced the overdraft to ##£##2,060. The overdraft was secured by a mortgage on the land and buildings, and, in addition, was supported by a guarantee of ##£##1,000 entered into by two guarantors, being jointly and severally liable.

                        <para>In 1931 the Lang Government introduced its Moratorium Act and the bank found itself unable to foreclose or call up the security.

The proposal of the Government aims at the socialization, confiscation, and complete political control of banking. The Minister for Transport wants to see a monetary revolution, with the Commonwealth Bank made subservient to the Government. If his ideas be given effect, every industry in this country will suffer ; and because industry is the greatest employer of labour, all persons engaged in industry will suffer. The reckless Minister who has. just resumed his seat dictates the financial policy of the Government, despite the protestations by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> at the last elections, as well as during the referendum campaign, that banking and insurance would not be nationalized. The Government has received no mandate from the people to introduce this legislation. Labour was elected on the understanding that party political measures would not be introduced during the war. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para class="block">I particularly direct attention to the words ##"## subservient to the Government ##"## in. the light of the bills now brought down by the Labour Government, as directed by the Australian Labour party convention. The avowed intention of the  Commonwealth  Bank Bill is to give the Government greater power over the policy of the bank, which can only lead to instability and lack of confidence. Nothing can be more disturbing to confidence, especially during war-time, than political tampering with the currency. The outstanding characteristic of the bills is that what is proposed is not banking reform but a monetary and banking revolution. Principles accepted the world over as fundamental to a sound monetary and banking system are defied. The principles upon which the Commonwealth Bank on the one hand, and the Australian note issue on the other, were established by a previous Labour Government are being ignored. It is not sufficient to say that the present Labour Government may be wiser in its generation. The fact still remains that no other government in the world - with one exception - has attempted to ignore long-established principles; nor, as far as we are aware, does amy other government anywhere in the world contemplate doing so. The one possible exception is Soviet Russia. But there the monetary and banking system has to serve a basically different kind of economy from our own. Is it the intention of the Government to use the revolutionized monetary and banking system to convert our economy into an economy of the Russian type? That, after all, would be in complete accord with the policy to which every member of the Government and every one of its supporters are pledged in writing. If that is the case, let the Government be honest with the Parliament and say so. If it is not, why are such revolutionary financial changes to be foisted upon us at all? Why is it intended to impose upon us a banking system which has been described by the sober London journal, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial News,</inline> as establishing a control ##"## rather more complete than that prevailing in Nazi Germany ##"## ? I ask honorable members to reflect on the fundamental departures, not only from ##"## the trend of banking development in all civilized countries ##"## - to quote the London <inline font-style="italic">Financial News</inline> again - but also from the principles and practices, first laid down by the Labour Prime Minister responsible for the act we are now asked to sweep aside, and subsequently followed by the first Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and every governor and  chairman  since the bank was established. The most far-reaching innovation is that the Commonwealth Bank is to be made subservient to the Government. ##"##Subservient to the Government##"##, significantly enough, are the words expressly used by the last Federal Conference of the Australian Labour party in its instructions to the Government. It is also of major significance that these instructions were issued four months after the last federal elections, when not a word was uttered by any responsible Government spokesman which would give the slightest indication that any such proposals##'##, as we now have before us, were even remotely contemplated. But subservience to the Government was the last thing the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher hoped to see. ##"## The bank##"##, he said, ##"##will stand on its own merits and must not be subjected to political influence.##"## ##"## It is ##"##, he added, ##"## quite outside the political arena.##"## That is where the bank##'##s founder wanted it kept. That is where it has been kept until to-day. </para>
                    <para>Shortly before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, the first Governor of the bank, died, his <inline font-weight="bold">deputy, Mr. James</inline> Kell, wrote - </para>

                    <para class="block">So the independence of the bank continued even when, with the provision for the bank to develop into a fully functioning central bank, a board of directors was appointed. To those who say that the appointment of a board was a departure from the principles followed under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, let me point this out. When the Commonwealth Bank was given its first central banking responsibility, namely, the transfer of the note issue from the control of the Treasury in 1920, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller himself accepted the view that that responsibility was the work of a board and not a single man. The Note Issue Department of the bank was then placed under a board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, as Governor of the bank, became a member. The principle of board control was continued when, in 1924, legislative provision was made for the bank to accept ail the responsibilities of a central bank. Throughout, there has been no departure from the original intention. The ultimate control of the bank, whether under a single governor or a board of directors, remained free from government or any other outside interference. Those who controlled the bank remained subject only to this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>The second revolutionary change now contemplated is the removal of any limitation on the note issue - that is to say, the people##'##s currency and the value of their savings in whatever form those savings might be. Not only is there no limit on the authority immediately responsible for issuing notes, but even that authority is not free to exercise the wisdom which such an authority should possess. At all times, decisions can be over-ridden and actions directed by any government in office. Contrary to what the Treasurer##'##s introductory speech would imply, the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems clearly expressed the view that there should be a statutory limitation on the note issue. Any divergence from that limitation should he a matter for consideration and approval by the Parliament. This, again, is a departure not only from monetary principles accepted everywhere as far as I have been able to discover - even in Russia - but also from the principle laid down by the Labour Government responsible, for the establishment of the Australian note issue. That Government laid down a statutory limitation in the form of a minimum percentage gold reserve. Since then there has been a variation from a reserve of gold only, to a reserve of gold and/or sterling. But the principle has never been challenged until to-day. </para>
                    <para>The third fundamental departure from the trend of banking development in all civilized countries is the instruction that the Commonwealth Bank shall ##"## develop and expand ##"## its general banking business. For the soundest of reasons, most central banks throughout the world stand aloof from the business of general banking altogether. In the case of those few central banks which, for good reasons, find it necessary to engage in some general banking business as an aid to effective central banking, their general banking activities are regarded as subordinate to their central banking business. </para>
                    <para>Central banking was hardly contemplated, at least in Australia, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher##'##s</inline> day, but evidence is available to show that he would have approved the form that the Commonwealth Bank has since taken. In introducing the first Commonwealth Bank Bill in 1911, he uttered these significant words - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It (the Commonwealth Bank) will ultimately become the bank of banks rather than a mere money-lending institution. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The ##"## bank of banks ##"## ! Not a bank merely competing with other banks, not a bank with such power over other banks that they would be mere agencies or satellites, but the ##"## bank of banks the central bank ##"## responsible for regulating the volume of credit while the trading banks are responsible for distributing that credit amongst different industries ##"##. Those are the words of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. They express clearly what should be the Commonwealth Bank##'##s place. They express also what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> in his day, was able only to hope. </para>
                    <para>That leads me to the fourth fundamental departure from what was intended by the Commonwealth Bank##'##s founders, what was the view of the royal commission - at least all the members of it except the present Treasurer - and what is an accepted principle of sound banking everywhere. The relationship between the central bank and the trading banks should be one of close co-operation, the leadership of the central bank being founded on the confidence of the member banks of the system within it. The proposal that the Commonwealth Bank should have statutory power to determine the lending policy of the trading banks is fundamentally in conflict with established principles. It is of no use to talk about these extraordinary controls being intended for use only in cases of emergency. There is no such indication in the proposed legislation. The trading banks will be constantly working under this sword of Damocles. In any case, I submit, very forcibly, that emergency acts are the responsibility of this Parliament. </para>
                    <para class="block">We have no right to delegate this responsibility to this . and subsequent governments in advance. In the emergency of the depression this Parliament was not slow to act. It did not always act along the lines the government of the day wanted. Indeed that is why these enormous powers over the monetary and banking systems - which, of course, mean almost corresponding powers over the whole economy - are now being sought. </para>
                    <para>The people have never authorized this Government to seek these powers. They have never authorized this Parliament to yield them. There is practical certainty that, in any case, they will not be required before the elections next year. In no circumstances, therefore, can this Parliament, if it still regards itself as the custodian of the democratic rights of the people, accept these proposals at this juncture. </para>
                    <para>The nationalization of banking is the first step to the socialization of industry. The real reason for this proposed change is to be found in the fact that Labour regards nationalization of the banking system as the first step towards complete socialization. </para>

                    <para>The essentials of banking are simple. On the one hand the banks borrow money from those who have it to lend, and on the other hand they lend money to those who can use it and who have some security to offer. They seek to make a profit on the transaction, like any other dealer. When one deposits money with a bank he expects to get it back in due course. ##"##When a bank lends money to a trader, the bank, in turn, expects to get it back in due course. The banks are rightly careful not to lend money on wild-cat schemes, because they need to get their money back in order to pay depositors. </para>
                    <para>Labour promises to make money available freely. This is a bait to catch the unwary, and a pertinent question which depositors should ask is whether the single bank Labour -plans would lend their money without the security which bankers to-day consider to be necessary in order to protect themselves and the depositors. Labour##'##s promises of easy money must mean that the depositors##'## money would be subjected to undue risk or that inflation would be practised under nationalization. Any one who has  observed  the pressure which the Trades Hal! officials exert upon the Parliamentary Labour party will have no doubt that nationalization of banking would mean inflation. The Federal Labour party, when in office, deliberately endeavoured to inflate the note issue. Germany and Prance are recent examples of the great evils which arise from inflation of currency. It reduces purchasing power, and does great harm, particularly to wage earners and pensioners. The present system protects the wages, savings, pensions and insurance policies of the people. It is clear that inflation would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the primary producer to compete with other countries with lower production costs which have no political interference with the currency. Nationalization of banking, and socialization of credit, do not mean only what those words imply. Nationalization would mean that all our industries - banking, farming, mining, shipping, ##&amp;##c. - would be taken away from the people who now own and control them, and would be placed under political control. This would really mean complete socialization, and would bring into force the Russian system of government. It is inconceivable that people who have farms, to obtain which they have worked hard and deprived themselves of many things for years, the owners of homes which are their castles, or the people who have saved for years and accumulated small sums to meet their requirements in case of adversity, will wish to hand their property to a government. It has been proved time and again that governments cannot manage businesses as efficiently as private enterprise. </para>

                    <para class="block">Nationalization means socialization. Socialization means communism. All of these are retrograde and disastrous policies. Their adoption would bring in their train indescribable misery and suffering. They would crush ambition, kill enterprise and stifle endeavour, and as a people we would deteriorate rapidly. There is nothing in these banking proposals which will aid the prosecution of the war. There has never been any suggestion that Australia has been in real need of money to finance its war commitments. The existing hanking system has stood up to the test of experience. The deposits of the people have been made available to the Government, and in spite of its wild and reckless policy every loan floated has been fully subscribed. The Government undertook at the last elections that if it were returned to power it would confine its attention to the winning of the war. This legislation is a stab in the back of our fighting men, 90 per cent, of whom will be dependent on private industry for re-employment in civil life after demobilization. The knowledge that the home front is divided on such an important issue must undermine the morale of those who are fighting for their country. The Government has no mandate for this legislation. The Prime Minister gave an unqualified pledge of which this is a complete and gross repudiation. The Government was elected on the understanding that it would not indulge in socialization during the war and it must ascertain the wishes of the electors before proceeding further with these measures. If, as the Opposition believes, there is no urgency, the matter should be postponed and be made an issue at the next general election. If the Government wishes to consider itself democratic, and does not want to wait until the next elections, it should proceed by way of referendum. Is it afraid to do so? The Government##'##s proposals were defeated at the last referendum and probably they would be defeated again if another were held. As I mentioned earlier, a recent Gallup poll showed that 93 per cent, of grocers and other small business men in Victoria are opposed to these two bills. A similar result would follow the taking of other Gallup polls. </para>
                    <para>I wish to emphasize what I regard as the dangers of this legislation. It is intended to abolish the Commonwealth Bank Board, and to force the Commonwealth Bank to compete actively in tradingbank business. Close co-operation between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government is necessary if the monetary system is to work smoothly. This will be possible only if the central bank i3 so constituted that it will be independent of the Government. The central bank must be able to frame its policy in accordance with the broad economic interests of the country as a whole, and should guard against giving undue weight to the budgetary problems of the Treasurer of the day. What must be avoided is making it easy for a Treasurer to balance his budget by dint of pressure on the central bank. In that way lies national financial collapse. The Commonwealth Bank##'##s task of controlling the note issue, and regulating the volume of credit, is essentially that of maintaining a high and stable level of economic activity. This means that it must be on the look-out for, and know how to check, incipient booms and depressions. It is not a task for a politician who is subject to political pressure from various groups and must always have one eye on the next elections, but it is essentially one for men of expert knowledge, training and experience. It should, therefore, be placed in the hands of specialists, controlled and guided in matters of broad policy by a board consisting of men of sound judgment and a variety of experience of various, phases of Australian economic life. The existing system provides such control - at least, it would if the spirit of the Commonwealth Bank Act were observed. It may be questioned whether all the Labour nominations to the board can be considered to have been made in that spirit, since two recent appointees can scarcely be said to have had the experience contemplated by the act, which provides that its members, other than the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, shall be nominated by the Government, as vacancies occur, from ##"## persons who are, or have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry ##"##. Members of the board are appointed for long over-lapping terms. This means that the long continuance of a policy distasteful to an incoming government is impossible##'##. But it also means that an opportunity is provided for the expression of the views of the minority, and that a check is provided on extremist views. The reasons why a central bank should be free from political domination are widely recognized, and have been repeatedly stressed by writers on central banking. . In the first place, the Government is the central bank##'##s largest customer. It cannot, at. the one time, be both banker and customer, without a clash of interests arising at some stage; and it may then have to choose between what would be the best policy to pursue in the long range interest of the country, and what would best suit its own immediate budget- .ary convenience. Secondly, if the central bank is too closely linked with the Government, sudden changes of the party in office may mean sudden reversals of banking policy, with all that that implies of disorganization of the economic structure of the community. Thirdly, as the credit policy pursued by the central bank affects vitally the whole economy, it is essential that it should be determined on sound principles and without bias, and not be made the plaything of party politics. Fourthly, the lesson of history is that political control of the currency almost inevitably leads to currency depreciation and ##»## inflation. Where no check is provided by maintaining the independence of the central bank, a government finds it difficult to resist the temptation to excessive credit, creation. Finally, if the central bank comes under political control, the door will be opened to corruption. Instead of credit being provided according to the soundness of the proposition or the creditworthiness of the borrower, the criterion may soon become his ability as a wirepuller or his willingness to bribe. </para>
                    <para>The general experience throughout history has been that where men##'##s livelihood depends on the decision of a public authority, there will be corruption. Professor Alfred Marshall says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Corruption seems generally to have increased when there has been much money to be gained by political influence. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Professor Marshall##'##s point is that policies involving control of industry have always reacted on the moral character of the administrators, and have induced them to use their authority for private gain. The real point is that any monopoly will have this drawback. A monopoly is always a law unto itself, whether it is a. private or a public monopoly. A public monopoly which rests on a foundation of law is always a more perfect monopoly than any private undertaking can be, because competition with it is excluded by law. A private monopoly always faces the danger of competitors arising if it imposes too much on the public. It also has to contend with the danger of public indignation, which results in legal restriction of its power to exploit the public. A government monopoly is in no such clanger. The public unfortunately will stand a great deal more in the way of abuses from it than it would from a private undertaking. </para>
                    <para>Where a public monopoly exists, as will happen under this measure, there is generally corruption, which in some cases becomes extremely serious. The difficulty is always that the individual has to go to the public authority either to buy its goods, or to seek its services. One of the worst modern examples is that of Germany, where permits had to be obtained to get most things, even foodstuffs and footwear. It was always possible in Nazi Germany, before the war, to get what one required by paying a small secret commission to the man who had the power to issue permits, and the amount of the commission varied with the importance of the request. Nazi leaders grew extremely rich by these means, and even the rank and file of the Nazi party, who were either themselves public officials or could ##"## pull strings ##"##, derived substantial incomes purely from the needs of the civilians. There is no reason to suppose that we can avoid this evil in Australia. We have it with us now, and not only in black markets. Under this form of hanking control it would unfortunately##'##  be  easy for such corrupt practices to creep into ##'## the whole of our industrial system. The  Commonwealth  Bank will, under this bill, control the lending policy of the whole of the banking system. </para>
                    <para class="block">It will be able to say that one industry may have money and another may not. The opportunities for corruption under such a system are obvious. </para>
                    <para>There is a further danger to the worker, as well as any other individual, in the proposed regulation of the lending policy of the trading banks. Regulations can be made so complicated that they allow a man or a firm in a given industry all the finance he requires, whilst his competitor may be entirely excluded from financial assistance. Commodities that compete are not always of the same nature. It would, for instance, be easy for the Commonwealth Bank to place a restriction on apple-growers, or prohibit further advances to banana-growers, thereby aiding one group of competitors in the fruit market against another. In fact, regulations for the control of advances could be used to control almost every industrial activity, and to push the individual around just as much as he was in the totalitarian countries. There is indeed every opportunity for totalitarian control, which is entirely opposed to our democratic ideals and which can be extremely dangerous to the freedom of the individual. Control of bank lending may not achieve this by itself, although it may go dangerously close to it, but the time will come when the Government will have to supplement the present controls by others, because once control has been established in a community it inevitably has to be supported by other controls until freedom is a thing of the past. Even the banking controls alone can lead in a large measure to manpower control. If we control the means by which men live we also control the men. The Government is, in fact, going very close to getting through these bills the control over the lives of the people which was refused them in the recent referendum, and the recent statement by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> that ##"## the time has passed when people can choose their own employment##"## may easily become a fact. Supporters of the Government have been fond of saying that they want to make the Commonwealth Bank a people##'##s bank. It is a people##'##s bank now and the proposed legislation, if passed by the Parliament, would make it merely a politician##'##s bank. </para>

                        <para>.- The speech of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> had a familiar ring, because it was consistent with the propaganda spread from time to time during recent months on behalf of the private banking interests. He followed in the footsteps of previous Opposition speakers and endeavoured to raise the bogy of inflation. Their remarks are not in conformity with the experience of other countries and the statements of prominent economic advisers throughout the world. Apparently, honorable members opposite are content to live in the past. The present banking systems have failed to keep pace with the advance of civilization and .the march of technological progress. Members of the Opposition have suggested that any interference with the banking institutions would bring ruin and virtual slavery to the people, but a glance at recent history shows the hardship which has been inflicted upon the masses of the people during times of depression. We know what has become of the savings of the people and of their business interests under the system of private banking. The general approach to this problem by the Opposition appears to have been merely to arouse fear on the part of the people regarding the legislative proposals of the Government which it has always endeavoured to engender when elections are pending. Although the predictions of honorable members opposite have proved to be unjustified, they resurrect their parrot cry from time to time, and try to stampede the people into action, which is against their best interests. We should examine the history of the banking institutions of the world, and consider their functions and purposes. The primary function of a banking institution is to assist in utilizing the resources of the country. How well that function has been performed in the past is realized by recalling the experience of the peoples of the world in economic depressions. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that in our banking legislation and in our financial reform we have groped our way forward. That is true, but while scientific discovery has been used in the development of trade and industry, the banking system has lagged behind. Private banks have used every means at their disposal to prevent - the introduction of a scientific banking system. Throughout the years they have sought to surround the working of the banking and monetary systems with an air of mystery and secrecy. We are told that banking is far too delicate a thing for governments to control ; that any talk of banking reform will create a lack of confidence, and result in the loss of the people##'##s savings, and even of their liberty. When other sections of the community have been forced to do this or that according to the will of the Government, the banks have been asked to fall into line. They have retained their domination over industry, and over the lives and well-being of the people. I have no hesitation in saying that I am in favour of the nationalization of the banking system of Australia, and I believe that other countries, after the war, will also have to tackle this problem. We cannot afford to have an antiquated banking system if we are to solve the problems which lie ahead of us. Ranking, by its very nature, is a public utility, as was recognized by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, which was appointed by the Lyons Government in 1935, and which reported in 1937. The commission stated that the banks were a semipublic utility, and, therefore, should conform to certain standards, and obey certain directions of the government of the day. I believe that, because of the power which the banks exercise over the property and lives of individuals, they must be under government control. Banking, of its very nature, is a virtual monopoly. It cannot be carried on without agreement among the banks not to compete against one another as to rates of interest, and such an arrangement removes almost every element of competition as we know it in business. The setting up of clearing houses is the final step in the trend towards monopoly. Existing banking legislation provides for the licensing of hanking institutions, and would-be newcomers to the field would find it difficult to gain an entry. Honorable members opposite have said that the banks are not responsible for economic depressions. They suggest that depressions have about them something supernatural - that it is impossible to avoid the cycle of a boom followed by a depression. Discussing this point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Gr. Hawtrey, high official of the British Treasury, a Fellow of the British Academy, and a lecturer of economics at the London University, said -   hi the nineteenth century and up to 1914 the trade cycle was accepted in a spirit of fatalism. Economists, unwilling to admit that it could be merely a monetary disease, surrounded it with an atmosphere of mystery. A systematic study Of the art of central banking reveals unmistakably the manner in which credit regulation causes unemployment. The common factor of pre-war and post-war experience is the intimate association of the ##"## State of Trade ##"## with the enlargements and compressions of the consumers##'## income and outlay effected by the banks. If this fundamental casual sequence were generally understood, the public would hardly acquiesce in the central banks, proceeding from their position of complacent detachment, to generate depression, unemployment, bankruptcy, budget deficits and defaults with all the##"## resulting political and social convulsions, while government after government is broken, because it can neither stem the flood-tide of ruin, nor even provide tolerable palliatives to alleviate the consequences. </para>
                    <para class="block">The primary function of the banking system should be to keep prices stable over long periods, and to avoid recurring booms and slumps.

                    <para class="block">That is true.

I maintain that the Government must, in fact, govern. The point must be determined whether the government of the day shall maintain its right to give instructions to the instrument of its own creation, or whether that instrument shall dominate the government and Parliament.

They do not tell us that it has been impossible to get that co-operation in the past, and that it is not likely to be forthcoming in the future. When the banks are in a position to charge high rates of interest, they will not be likely to work in cooperation with governments or any authorities which might reduce their  profits.

                    <para class="block">That is the question. The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems pointed out that the government of the day is the authority to which is given the power to make decisions and to do all things necessary for the fulfilment of the functions with which it, is entrusted. As that power is vested in the Executive, it should be in a position to say to all banking institutions what long-term policy shall be pursued. That does not mean dictation of the day-to-day policy of such institutions. It is interesting to read that one member of the commission was not satisfied with the activities of the hanks and the methods by which they increased their profits. The present honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> a member of the commission, questioned one of the witnesses closely as to the rebate system. He pointed out that the rebates arranged under an agreement which had been entered into between the banks and the shipping companies were returned not to the primary producers, the owners of the produce, but went to the bankers who financed the operations of the farmers in conveying their wool to Great Britain. The Leader of the Opposition said that central banking was a comparatively recent development. That is so. The Bank of England was established in 1694, and since then there have been no major developments in the form of banking. Banking institutions have grown slowly and have failed to keep pace with the needs of the modern world. As the right honorable gentleman said, we have blundered and groped our way forward. He regarded the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> as the father of central banking in Australia. The right honorable member for Cowper himself thought that he was entitled to the credit. The Commonwealth Bank has stood the tests through which it has passed, and to-day it is firmly established in the community. The additional powers conferred on it by legislation passed in 1924 were quite insufficient to enable it to fulfil the functions of a central bank. A central bank must have power to dictate to other banks what the rate of interest shall be, and should be able to curtail their activities in certain directions. It should he able to limit their##'## lending in boom times, and to expand their lending in times of depression. The traditional functions of the banks have been open market operations and the use of the hank rate. There must be more control of investments and provision to direct investments into essential channels in an orderly manner, instead of by the harsh and unsatisfactory methods which have operated in the past. When the hank-rate is raised, it is supposed to restrict lending and discourage borrowing, but in boom times it does not have that effect. The immediate result is to increase the profits of the banks. The first impact is upon the essential needs of a country. It is true that the basic needs return the smallest profit to investors; investment in luxury lines gives greater profit. When the interest rate is raised, it makes its impact first on the primary producers whose marginal profit is small. It limits credit in the place where it should not be limited, and places very little restriction where ##'## profits are high. Investment on luxury goods should be curtailed when only limited credit is available. My main condemnation of the present banking system is that bankers have failed to learn the lessons of the past. Even before the Christian era there were depressions, and they were met by the same methods as are employed to-day. In the first century before the Christian era Rome suffered from a great depression. It was only stemmed by the largest creditor in Rome agreeing not to call in advances and, in fact, to lend more. That proved to be sound economy. Experience has shown that when a depression is developing banks should diversify their activities in order that, if one branch is declining, they may exploit another instead of withdrawing large amounts of credit and thereby bringing the financial structure tumbling about their ears. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member##'##s interjection reminds me that in a depression it is claimed that a low rate of interest will begin an upward rise to normal conditions; but that is far from the truth, because we find that the banks are incapable of coping with the situation that they have brought about. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> to-night quoted the opinions of two eminent bankers that the depression had developed beyond the control of the banks. That, demonstrates the inefficiency of the bank-rate as a check on a depression. We know that, regardless of the interest rate, in a depression the people are deterred from borrowing because industry is stagnating and the profits necessary to enable repayment are not earned. There are two faults in the present method of providing additional credit by private banks. In the first place, before persons are willing to engage in activities they must be assured that they will return profits, and, in the second place, even if additional credit is made available, there is no certainty that the banks will expand credit, but may, instead, use it to build up additional reserves against deposit liabilities. That brings me to the question of a central bank. The Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems recommended - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Opposition points to the Bank .of England as the ideal pivot of the banking structure of any country. It engages in substantial banking activities. In depressions it finances various bodies to enable reconstruction and it will do so again after the war. The  MacMillen  Committee on Finance and Industry recommended that not only was that proper but also that the Bank of England should amalgamate the note issue with its general banking business. It felt that there was no real need to have a division of interests in that regard and said that, in fact, division might prove a weakness. The general banking business of the Commonwealth Bank is necessary, not only because it supplements other measures by which it can influence the policy of trading banks, but also because it can compete with them and in fact force them into action. I admit that there is a danger that, if it did that, its liquid cash reserves might be drawn off to build up the reserves of the private banks. Therefore I regard as important the provision that not only shall the  Commonwealth  Bank seek business, but also that governmental and municipal bodies shall bank with it. We are told that that is coercion, but it is rather foolish, in a country like this, that government and municipal authorities should bank with private banks when, in fact, the result of their paying interest to the Commonwealth Bank is reduced taxation, because the profits of the Commonwealth Bank go into Consolidated Revenue, thus benefiting these organizations of government. </para>

If the Australian Country party considers that private banks should he allowed after the war to impose whatever rates of interest they like upon the farming community and others, it will lose the few remaining shreds of confidence which the farming community used to have in it, and the repercussions will be felt at the next general elections. ! come now to the management of the Commonwealth Bank and the substitution of an advisory council for the Commonwealth Bank Board set up in 1924 by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> when Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government. I can see advantages in a board) but none whatever in such a .board as that appointed by the Government at that time. It will be admitted, surely, that an institution of the character of the Commonwealth Bank, which can and does affect the whole economic life and the welfare of the people, should be managed by people with a technical knowledge of banking, ibo ability to assess trends and to be able  to estimate what a certain policy will result in if applied, and should not by a board consisting of men chosen for their knowledge of##'## industry and commerce. The method of control proposed iti this legislation is far wiser. The right honorable member for Cowper claimed that the changes which he made endowed the bank with wider powers, but they only resulted in the bank being deprived of the initiative to search for new business. The progress that it had been making was stultified. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G.

Honorable members opposite have claimed that the proposals of the hill in regard to the abolition of the note issue reserve will have dreadful consequences, but this policy was recommended by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. The policy has also been recommended by very many financial experts and economic advisers. The argument that gold is necessary as a cover for notes has no substance behind it; a reserve of securities may have some advantages. Gold, as we all know, is entirely unproductive, whereas securities yield their return in interest.

                    <para>The rule of thumb used by the bankers in the past has not been satisfactory. It has resulted in sudden cycle of  booms  and slumps. Proper attention has not been given to the necessity to employ the idle resources of the nation in the national interest. I consider that it is essential that the central bank should have the power which the Government now proposes to vest in the Commonwealth Bank. That institution should be authorized to indicate the manner in which investments should be expanded or contracted. This does not mean, as the Treasurer pointed out in his speech, that the Government, as a general rule and at all times, will interfere with banking policy. It is, however, fundamental to wise government that the Executive shall have power to direct investments. No government, unless it is prepared to abdicate its right to govern, should allow such a power to remain in the hands of private bankers. A government, better than any other authority in the community, can exercise judgment on developments that are necessary to the welfare of the great mass of the people as against the fortunate few. </para>

Through the years we have been taught to believe that high finance is the mystery of mysteries. The international financiers have exercised a kind of black magic, and they have encouraged the belief that they and their institutions are above the control and beyond the power of governments. This attitude must be abandoned and I am glad that the Government is taking  steps to ensure that all hanking institutions will be obliged to reveal their true financial position. </para>
                    <para>I welcome the introduction of this legislation. I believe that its provisions are largely in accord with the general desires of the community. Undoubtedly the Commonwealth Bank should be strengthened and developed. For this purpose trained men and women will be required. The only source from which they can be obtained at present is from the trained staffs of the private banking companies. The Treasurer should go as far as he can towards giving a definite assurance that if the staffs of the private banks desire to enter the employment of the Commonwealth Bank and, by loyal co-operation, help to build up that institution so that it may provide more fully for the development of this country and the well-being of its people, the conditions will be made attractive to them. Their services will be needed, and our responsibility to them is no less than that which we have to any other section of the community. I know that the Treasurer has stated from time to time that every facility in that direction will be provided. In the post-war years, there will be strains and stresses that have not previously been experienced, and if the Government is unable to control the finances of this country there will be, not the inflation suggested by honorable members opposite, but ruin and bankruptcy, which any administration will be powerless to combat. We shall see unemployment and want throughout the community, and the dissipation of the savings of men and women in their efforts to maintain themselves while struggling to obtain work. The dreadful scenes of the past will be repeated. We have been told that we are fighting this war in order to make the world a fit place in which to live. If we do not pass this legislation, and control the private banking institutions, there is no certainty that the plans we have made and the schemes we have laid for the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen and the development of this country, can be given effect. I welcome the bill, and am confident that it will be warmly acclaimed throughout the country. </para>

                    <para>Your application was one of these. We made a strong recommendation that your application should he granted, and, of course, your academic record with us was a good one - several of your papers reaching honours standard. All this was pointed out and when your application was refused, Professor Williams interviewed Professor Mills on the matter (along with two or three others). The answer given in your case was that there was a general rule that graduates could not be released unless they were taking a combined course (i.e., arts and law and had thus graduated in arts during first year law). You were a graduate in economics and thus were ruled out. ... I think you should point out - what, no doubt, is the case - that you took economics as a prelude to law, as I know many mcn are advised to do this, since a knowledge of economics is very useful in the profession. Your length of service is too a strong argument - although the commission docs not seem as impressed with that as we are. </para>

                <para class="block">This young man, I submit, has fulfilled every condition that is necessary to qualify for release from the Army in order to attend the university. For some reason, he has been denied the opportunity - which I am advised has been given to others who have not his qualifications - to resume his studies at the university. Hi3 academic record prior to enlistment was brilliant. It would appear that one big drawback is that during his military service with the Australian Imperial Force he had the initiative to graduate in economics. Another factor is that prior to enlistment he was a part-time student.  His  father has pointed out that he could not afford full-time studies at the university, and had to work in the day-time in order to maintain himself.  His  chances of completing his studies should not be jeopardized by reason of the fact that he had to maintain himself by working in the day-time, and thus could be only a part-time student. My advice is that servicemen with inferior qualifications who have graduated in . economics, have been released and are continuing their studies at the university. There may have been discrimination against this young man, probably quite unconsciously. I ask the Minister representing the Acting Minister for the Army to look into the matter, with a view to doing justice. Probably, he could not resume his university studies at this late period of the academic year ; but his case should be kept in mind, and the matter of his release should be considered when the next releases are being made of men who wish to attend university courses. </para>

                    <para>.- I bring to notice the case of Harold Charles Cornish, Private V49213, son of an exsoldier who gave that kind of useful inconspicuous service which has gone so far to build up the reputation of servicemen throughout the ##"##world.  His  private place of residence is 256 Bell-street, East Preston, Victoria. The soldier has been found guilty, so I am led to infer - for the ways of courts-martial are peculiar - of absence without leave. He may even have been found guilty of desertion; certainly not desertion in face of the enemy, or without good cause - for in my opinion he had excellent cause, namely, being a man on active service when he is physically quite unfit for it. I am very anxious to have his case dealt with by the Acting Minister for the Army, or by the Minister for the Army himself should he return to Australia before the release of the soldier, which we hope will not be the case. Three months ago Cornish was sentenced by court martial to two years##'## detention. He is a sufferer from more physical ills than fall to the lot of the average man. ##"##When he was three years old he fell into a bucket of nearly boiling water which resulted in a continuing injury and scored lines across the small of his back and his buttocks, which I have seen and which necessitated years of treatment in the Children##'##s Hospital. He is completely deaf in one ear, and has a twisted arm that has been fractured at least half a dozen times, and which prevents him from using a rifle. He has been temporarily blind since he was struck by a stone thrown by a fellow scholar : it severed an artery and caused blindness extending over a considerable period.  His  sight is now defective, and has been continually so. Under the name of Charles Grant, the surname being his mother##'##s maiden name, he was discharged as unfit for military service. There is no record that the court-martial took any account of that fact. It may have done so, but its deliberations were partly in secret, according to the ways of courts-martial. Its recommendations finally had to be confirmed by some mysterious higher authority, before which I did not appear, and they were made to a military body, or officer, before whom no argument took place. Our exhibits have not been returned to us : I refer particularly to the discharge for unfitness which I put in as evidence before the court-martial at the request of the soldier and his parents. Apparently, it has been confiscated. It is true that the soldier was absent without leave for a considerable time, and it may be that he received a longer sentence because of the fact that I appeared for him.  His  absences arose from his long-continued protest against being kept in the service for which he was quite unfitted medically, and in respect of which he had actually received a discharge. It is true that he received it under a name to which he was certainly not entitled, but that should not be held against him as a very serious offence. The practice is commonly resorted to for the purpose of getting into the service, rather than out of it. It is obvious that all these conditions and the man##'##s physical defects called urgently for specialized treatment.  His  lack of hearing, his twisted arm and his defective eyesight called for it. It is not surprising that the parents are indignant that his case should be left to the perfunctory examination of a medical officer who naturally and necessarily takes cases in the mass and may conclude that a soldier is ##"## swinging the lead ##"##. This man recently married and his wife and parents wish to give him specialized treatment. A doctor looks at him casually with others, especially as he has the stigma of having been convicted for absence without leave. That places him at a grave disadvantage. It is common in these cases to say that the sentence will be reviewed at some time in the more or less distant future - that is, reviewed subject to good conduct. It is equally common, however - and I say this with knowledge - to declare that the prisoner##'##s conduct at the time of the review, according to the person charged with the duty of reviewing it, has not been such as to warrant leniency. I know that that has been most unfairly done in one or two cases. I have heard of such cases, and notably when the soldier##'##s conduct has been exemplary. That is the point where the military authorities completely override the Executive Government. I submit, therefore, that having regard to this soldier##'##s state of health, and the fact that he is, in my view, obviously unfitted for service, a lenient view should be taken of his irregular conduct in parting from service for the reasons which I have mentioned. Inasmuch as he has been discharged from the Army, as I understand he has, he should also <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> discharged from custody, because no useful purpose can be served by his further detention. This is only one case of many, but it is the one which has first claim on my attention. This is a matter of ministerial responsibility rather than one for the military authorities, and I hope that the Minister will take a firm stand in regard to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to draw attention to the poor quality of material used in the making of children##'##s shoes and boots sold in South Australia. Some time ago, I produced in this House a pair of shoes the soles of which had worn out after a fortnight##'##s use by a boy ten and a half years of age. ##'##I was told on that occasion that, as the shoes carried no brand, nothing could be done in the matter. After I returned home, I bought for 12s. lid. another pair of shoes with nailed soles, and I have here the receipt for the payment. On the 5th May, exactly three weeks after the date of purchase, I had to take the shoes to the cobbler to be repaired. It is evident that leather is available of a better quality than was put into shoes, because the sole which the cobbler puts on lasts for months. People with  large  families must find it very hard to keep their children shod when the quality of footwear is so bad. I know that the quality of leather has improved since control has been exercised by the Government, but the quality of footwear sold in South Australia is still very bad. I hope that something can be done to improve it. </para>

Forde, declared in his speech at the plenary session - ##"## The term ##'## veto ##'## is not altogether a happy one. In relation to sanctionsit means only this: that if the world organization is to exercise economic or military sanctions against an aggressor, which, of course, involves acts of war, its leading members must act unitedly or not at all. But the very considerations which are appropriate to enforcement action by the greater powers are out of place in relation to the settlement of disputes by means of conciliation, arbitration or by other pacific means. In such cases - which are covered by Chapter VIII.aof the Dumbarton Oaks proposal##'##s - the Security Council should be empowered to act by the proposed majority of seven without the requirement of the approval by each and every one of the five great powers. I think that this point of view is implicit in the Yalta formula, which in relation to Chapter  VIII.a,  prevents a power which is party to a dispute  from voting at all.##"##.. </para>

                        <para>y - On the 23rd and 24th May the honorable member for ##"##Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> and on the 25th May the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> asked mo questions regarding disputes at Lysaghts Limited, in Newcastle. In some of these questions it was suggested that the rights to reinstatement of ex-servicemen were being prejudiced and that the ex-servicemen were being embarrassed by factional squabbles. The facts are that there have recently been two distinct disputes at Lysaghts Limited, the first of which concerned a matter of reinstatement under the provisions - of the National Security (Reinstatement in Civil Employment) Regulations, and - the second of which was consequent upon the reinstatement of an employee, but has, in fact, nothing to do with the rights of returned men. The first dispute commenced on the 14th May, when nightshift workers in one mill stopped work, refusing to work with an ex-serviceman, E. J. Baker, who had been reinstated by the company. As a result of this dispute, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cantor visited Newcastle, and on the 17th May he issued a judgment to the effect that the company had acted properly and in compliance with the regulations. Following  this decision, the night shift resumed work that night. As a result of Baker##'##s reinstatement, however, the man who had been employed in Baker##'##s position and a number of others had to be moved to different jobs. In the course of this reshuffle a dispute arose on the matter of seniority, and a further stoppage of work occurred in another mill <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the 16th May. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cantor subsequently visited Newcastle again, and on the 24th May gave a decision on this matter of seniority. There was no new strike on the 24th May as suggested by the honorable member for New England. In view of the fact that the man concerned has been reinstated and the men in his mill have returned to work, no question of embarrassment arises, as implied by the honorable member for Wentworth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cantor##'##s decision safeguarded the rights of the returned man in this case, but I repeat the Prime Minister##'##s assurance that the Government will take all possible steps to ensure that there shall be no victimization of ex-service personnel and that their undoubted reinstatement rights shall be preserved. </para>
