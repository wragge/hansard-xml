            <para>- A few weeks ago, the Production Executive, which has some voice in this matter, considered the relaxation of restrictions. It learned that the stocks of coal are higher to-day than they were some little time ago. Nevertheless, because of the necessity to accumulate reserves to meet the demands of the winter months, the relaxation of the regulations dealing with night lighting was regarded as undesirable except in regard to such lighting as was generated by the use of fuel other than black coal. &#34;Wherever possible, the restrictions will be relaxed in such circumstances. It will be extremely difficult to remove the existing controls until we are assured that the stocks of coal are sufficient to meet the requirements of the winter period. </para>

            <para>- Is the Acting Prime Minister able to inform the House of the negotiations that are taking place between representatives of the Australian and British Governments, with a view to the continuance in the post-war period of the wool stabilization scheme that has been in operation during the war period? Can he say whether there are bright prospects of the wool industry being able to continue its operations after the war at the price which has been paid by the British Government for all wool produced in Australia during the war. </para>

            <para>- I cannot give any definite information regarding wool prices. A great accumulation of wool, which has been purchased by the Government of Great Britain from Australia and other dominions has occurred during the war, and the disposal of it now presents considerable difficulty. The problem of disposing of that wool as well as the clips that will be coming forward has given much concern to the Commonwealth Government, and I presume also to the governments of other dominions, whilst the matter has caused some anxiety to the Government of Great Britain in its effort to provide a reasonable guarantee to wool-growers for the future. At the request of that Government a conference was convened in London, and it is now taking place, for the discussion of the problems relating to the disposal of the surplus stocks and the current clips as they come forward. Australia is represented at the conference by the Secretary to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy,</inline> and the Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane.</inline> In view of the great importance of the matter the Government considered it desirable to send those high officers to the conference. I understand that the discussions will continue for another seven or eight days. Certain proposals have been advanced, but decisions have not yet been reached. Any final agreement reached will have to be endorsed by the governments of the respective dominions. </para>

            <para>- Last year, Brisbane waters and other waters were opened for net fishing, and an official statement was made that that had been done by the State authorities at the request of the Commonwealth Government. In view of vehement protests from the Gosford and Woy Woy councils and other district bodies against further net fishing, will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction have the matter investigated, with a view to determining the damage done to fish breeding by permitting the netting of fish in these waters? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that in the circumstances no further action shall be taken to permit net fishing in waters which are ordinarily closed, thus denuding those waters of fish ? </para>

            <para>- It would appear from what the honorable member has said that certain waters normally closed to net fishing have been opened by the State Government to that kind of fishing at the request of my department. It may betrue that during war-time we have had to open to fishing certain waters which normally would not have been fished. The reason is that we desire to build up in wartime supplies of fish, partly to replace meat, which has been rationed. I am sure that before these waters were opened to netting, the whole matter was fully investigated by my department and by the State Government concerned. The waters would not have been opened at all if, in the opinion of the State authorities, who have the final jurisdiction in the matter, such action would detrimentally affect the supply offish in post-war years. I shall have a full inquiry made, and the honorable member will be advised of the result. </para>

The regulations are constantly under review, in order to decide whether it is practicable to remove or relax some of them. At present a special departmental committee is advising the Ministers concerned, and examining all of the controls, having regard to the factors of man-power and materials, in order to ascertain what controls can be relaxed. </para>

I understand that, following revelations published in a weekly newspaper, the permit has been withdrawn find .cancelled by the departmental officials in Sydney. In view of the fact that this man has been shown to have been guilty of unpatriotic conduct by understating his income for taxation purposes to the .amount of over &#163;6,000, in circumstances which the Commissioner of Taxation would probably regard as suggesting fraud, are any proceedings contemplated against him for his flagrant breach of the law? Will the Minister inquire whether any other person acted in collusion with him in obtaining the permit, and W111 he refer the matter to the Crown Law authorities? </para>

            <para>- It is true that yesterday morning the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction and I received a deputation representing a great part of Mumimbidgee area, and we discussed a proposal for the diversion .of the Snowy River waters, principally for irrigation purposes, but also, no doubt, for the generation of electric power. Members of the deputation, at considerable length, explained the proposals which they had in mind, and which would involve an expenditure of &#163;13,000,000. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction explained to them that the proposed diversion was of great concern to the State of Victoria, and that before anything could be done it would be necessary to reach an agreement with the Government of Victoria as well as the Government of New South Wales. Neither the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction nor I gave consideration to the merits or demerits of the proposal. It was pointed out to the deputation that the making of agreements between State governments was usually a very difficult matter, and in this instance the Commonwealth Government would also be a party to the agreement. As for the suggestion that a commission should be appointed to examine the proposal, I point out that,, after the war, there will be so many urgent works to be undertaken, that unless this particular work had been by then already engineered, and plans prepared and agreements concluded, it would be unlikely to be undertaken for a considerable time. Apart from any action which this Government may take, the proposal must necessarily become the subject of consultation &#39; between the Commonwealth and State governments. Money will have to be found before the work can be done, and the finding of the money will, no doubt, be a matter fortho Loan Council. </para>

      <para class="block">Before leaving Sydney yesterday morning, I conferred with the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> who told me that no one in his department had any authority to make such comment. Actually, the comment which was attributed to a State government official is just silly, and displayed complete ignorance of Commonwealth Wheat Stabilization Regulations. The fact is that hay-growers are not required to register under the wheat stabilization plan. Hundreds of hay-growers in the various States are not registered. In 1942, in answer to a question asked by the then honorable member for Swan, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marwick,</inline> I made it clear that no restriction was imposed upon the growing of hay in any part of Australia. Farmers could grow as much hay as they chose. Quite recently, on the borders of my own electorate, one man grew 2,000 acres of wheat for hay without registering, and the crop was ultimately sold to the Victorian Government. </para>

            <para>- A similar question was addressed to me yesterday by the honorable member for EdenMonaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fraser)</inline> and I then arranged to have a full statement prepared for him. I do not remember the details of the reply which has been forwarded to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, but I shall arrange for the same information to be supplied to the honorable member for Darling. I understand that draft financial agreements covering soldier land settlement have been prepared and are ready to be forwarded to the States. As three of the States will act as principals and three as agents, two forms of agreement have been prepared and the State governments have been asked to comment on them. In the meantime, there is nothing to prevent the State governments from going ahead with the acquisition of estates. They have been invited to forward to the Commonwealth Government a list of the properties which they propose to acquire for the land settlement of ex-servicemen. Their proposals will have to be approved by the Commonwealth Government which will bear a proportion of the cost. I cannot say that I am fully acquainted with the latest information on the subject, but I understand that the Queensland Government&#39;s proposals are more advanced than are those of the other States. About a week ago I was informed that in all States plans for the subdivision of land are well advanced. There is nothing to prevent the State governments from selecting the areas which they desireto bring under the scheme. The State governments will set up bodies, on which the Commonwealth Government will he represented, to select suitable settlers from among the applicants. </para>

            <para>- Cable for electricity extensions is needed in a number of country areas, particularly in the Bega valley. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture approach the heads of the armed forces with a view to ascertaining whether, at this stage of the war, the large stocks that are being held to meet their needs, can be reviewed with a view to making a small part available where it can be shown that the use of the cable would enable electrification of farms and thus contribute to the production of food, particularly dairy products? </para>

Nothing is alleged to be wrong with the forms except that the particulars required were typed. Is it the intention of the Government to abolish typewriters, for instance in theTreasury, where they are used for filling in cheques, or does it intend to refuse to accept any form that is typewritten, notwithstanding that it is properly signed? Alternatively, will the Acting Prime Minister just whisper in the official&#39;s ear, &#34; Don&#39;t be so silly &#34; ? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the statement. In New South Wales and Victoria, flour milling has been reduced to one shift a day. In South Australia and other States it has been reduced to two shifts a day. I had a long discussion with the manager of the Australian Wheat Board about this matter. The plain fact is that there is insufficient wheat in Australia to meet even rationed feed requirements as well as a full milling programme. I assure the honorable gentleman and those who are agitated that the offal deficiency will be offset by extra supplies of wheat. The food value of offal is only one-third that of wheat. Reduction of the number of flour-rnilling shifts and rationing of feed are the only means by which we shall , be able to tide ourselves over until the next harvest. </para>

            <para>- The United Kingdom White Paper dealing with awards to servicemen refers in section 2 to those who have already been awarded the 1939-45 Star - for service in Sicily or Malaya. How does the Acting Prime Minister reconcile that statement with the explanations given from time to time by the Prime Minister that the issue of the 1939-43 Star to members of the Australian Imperial Force in Malaya and New Guinea was the subject of negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Great Britain? Has a decision been reached concerning the right of newspaper war correspondents to awards granted by General MacArthur? Can the Acting Prime Minister make a clear statement as to what representations are being made by the Commonwealth Government to the British Government regarding men who have served in the operational area around Darwin? </para>

          <para>. - I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to defer his amendment because a preliminary question arises which I think should be considered by the committee. The clause defines members of the forces in certain categories. It includes members of the permanent forces other than the Australian Imperial Force, members of the Australian Imperial Force, and members of the Citizen Forces &#34; enlisted, appointed, or called up for continuous service for the duration of, and directly in connexion with, the war &#34;. The definition then deals with certain women&#39;s services and so on. The question has arisen - I know that it has been discussed among honorable members privately - and it should be, I think, settled in the committee, as to how far this definition includes aliens. My own impression is that it includes both enemy aliens and friendly aliens for all purposes, and I should like the Minister to throw some light on the problem. A member of the forces being defined in this way seems to include, for a start, both the Permanent Forces and the Citizen Forces. Section 30, Part III., of the Defence Act which deals with the constitution of the defence forces of the Commonwealth provides - </para>

        <para>Having regard to those provisions, as I read them, it seems clear that the expression &#34; a member of the Citizen Forces who is or was enlisted, appointed or called up for continuous service for the duration of, and directly in connexion with the war &#34; covers all aliens under military law other than those in the Australian Imperial Force, and would include aliens serving in the labour corps; because the word &#34; soldier &#34; in the regulations to which I have referred is defined in section 4 of the Defence Act as including &#34; a non-commissioned officer and every person subject to Military Law &#34;. In those circumstances it would appear - and I would welcome the Minister&#39;s correction on this point if I am wrong - that the definition clause in the bill before us includes in the bill for all purposes, &#39;including preference and reinstatement, all aliens who have served either in the Australian Imperial Force or in the Citizen Forces including the Labour Corps; and that they are included automatically whether they are enemy aliens or friendly aliens. It may very well be - and I imagine it is so, particularly, in the Labour Corps - that a certain number of those are enemy aliens. If that is true, it opens up a very wide question to which, no doubt, honorable members would desire to address themselves; because there are aliens, and aliens. There are some whose personal friendliness towards the country would be beyond doubt. But there are some who have found their way into the Labour Corps after a period of internment, and their attitude towards the country might be open to considerable doubt. However, I do not want to go into the merits of the matter at this stage. I ask that the Minister clarify the position so that the committee may know whether it is discussing a clause which incorporates in the bill for all purposes of the bill, aliens, whether enemy or friendly, who have served in any of the unite to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>.- The right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> apparently wants to make absolutely certain that the members of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force are included in  these definitions. They are included in paragraph a, therefore, it is not necessary to include them in paragraph 6. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> sought an explanation of the position of the Army Labour Corps. It is true that, this definition of a &#34; member of the Forces &#34; does include those who are serving in the Army Labour Corps. In addition, it includes aliens.

          <para>.- This clause is probably the most important provision in the bill, because it will determine what classes shall benefit under clauses 16 and 17 in connexion with reinstatement in employment and preference. From the way in which this bill has been presented, it is obvious that it has been hastily conceived and very badly drafted. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made clear beyond all doubt that whatever may be argued regarding the meaning of the Defence Act, the words &#34; a member of the Citizen Forces &#34; will cover all persons who have been called up for military service or served in the Army Labour Corps in this country. To speak of servicemen in the same breath as enemy aliens and non-enemy aliens who were called up for the Army Labour Corps, is to make a travesty of the whole proposition of preference to exservicemen. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If honorable members will examine the whole of this clause, they will see. that a person who has been in the services for only a day or a week is eligible to receive all the benefits of this legislation. Every person covered by the words &#34; member of the Forces &#34;, regardless of whether he was discharged at the end of a week, and irrespective of the locality and nature of his service, will be placed on exactly the same footing as men who served abroad in various theatres of war for four years. That is not my conception of our obligations to the exserviceman, and I cannot believe that it is the conception of any one who seeks to make a fair distinction between those who really have claims on this country for rehabilitation and those who, in point of fact, have not. The definition covers any person who, during the war, was  a  member of the Australian Imperial Force  irrespective of the length of his service, when he may have transferred from the Citizen Military Forces, or who was enlisted, appointed or called up for continuous service for the duration of, and directly in connexion with, the war. Therefore, it is obvious that a person qualifies for the benefits of this legislation once he is called up for continuous service. In spite of the fact that such a person may have been discharged from the forces a week, or a month, or three months, after having enlisted, his entire service having been perhaps in a base area, where he was not able to do very much towards the successful prosecution of the war, he is to be placed on exactly the same footing as the man who volunteered at the outbreak of war for service in any part of the war, and in fact served for three, four or five years at the battlefront. It is idle to contend that this is a proper conception of our obligation to our servicemen. The vice of this provision will be seen by an examination of clause 16, for example. That clause states - </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(4)">
            <para>Where several persons apply to a former employer to be reinstated in employment and it is not reasonably practicable for him to make employment available to each of those persons, the former employer shall make employment available to as many of those persons as is reasonably practicable and in the order which gives preference, as between any two applicants, to the applicant whoso length of service with that employer was the greater at the date on which the applicant who first commenced a period of war service commenced that period of war service. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>It may be assumed that the younger a man is, the more likely is it that he entered the war at the commencement and served overseas. Therefore, the younger the man, the less likely is it that a colleague who remained with his employer until being called up for military service will have had a shorter period of service with that employer. Clearly, the young man who enlisted at the outbreak of war will be at a disadvantage when it comes to reinstatement in his former employment, and this is called preference to returned soldiers ! I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to say whether or not the facts are as I have stated. If my interpretation be correct, itshows how important it is that this clause should be limited. As I said in my second-reading speech, the wider the field over which the Government pretends to spread preference, the less will be the value of the preference that ultimately is given. Not only is that point of importance, but also in accordance with sub-clause 5 of clause 16, if in the case which I have cited, the employer happened to employ the younger man, and some years afterwards, the older man came along seeking a job, the employer would be obliged to dispense with the services of the first man, provided he could not employ both of them. I repeat that in this definition is the vice of the entire proposals. Unless preference be limited to men who enlisted for active service and spent some time on that service, the Government&#39;s entire preference scheme will be reduced to a complete sham. Although clause 27 provides that in granting preference in employment to ex-servicemen, an employer shall consider &#34; the length, locality and nature of the service&#34; of the applicants, the clause does not state what weight shall be placed on each of those factors. Indeed, a close examination of the whole proposal makes it quite obvious that it gives no real protection whatever to the man who really needs preference. In clause 4, &#34;war service&#34; is defined, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> as - </para>

            <para>- It has been quite obvious throughout this debate that the Government, having brought in this bill, intends to stick to it, irrespective of what  criticism may be levelled at it. When we come to examine a subsequent clause we shall show quite clearly that this bill is designed not to give preference to exservicemen, but to preserve preference to trade unionists. This clause requires redrafting.  It cannot be corrected simply by moving amendments to it; it will have to be recast completely. It is quite clear that the definitions have been drafted to cover such a wide field as to render valueless, or well nigh valueless, the subsequent preference provisions. </para>

          <para>.- 1  am very surprised to learn that this bill covers, enemy aliens. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said last night that if at the committee , stage of this measure there were any provisions which he and the Parliament thought should be altered, he would agree to that course being taken. If enemy aliens are placed in the same category as Australians under this clause, it should be altered. Men who have been interned in this country-- </para>

            <para>- Enemy aliens should be excluded from the .provisions of this clause. I cannot see why enemy aliens, who presumably lived here for some years without taking the trouble to become naturalized, should share in the benefits which will be provided for Australian men and women who have served on our behalf. Many enemy aliens who were interned were liberated after a certain time and placed in a labour corps for service in: various parts of Australia. Surely it is not the intention of the Go vernment to place these men in the same position as Australian servicemen? </para>

I say without hesitation that those men have never been so well off as they are now. I cannot see why they should be placed in the same category as Australian citizens and friendly aliens, such as Americans, Russians and Greeks, who have served this country. I sincerely hope that the Minister will amend the clause so that enemy aliens will not receive benefits comparable to those provided for our own servicemen. </para>

          <para>.- I am glad that the Minister will accede to the suggestion which has been made from this side of the committee. In my second-reading speech, I pointed out that many people who were not justly entitled to the benefits provided in the bill would be able to claim them. The honorable gentleman assured me then that the Government did not have that intention, but it is no accident that the clause was so vague in its original form. I believe that it was drafted for the purpose of including enemy aliens. I now ask the Minister to agree to another amendment to clarify the clause further. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the definition of &#34;member of the Forces &#34; reads - </para>

          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">The term &#34; Permanent Forces &#34; should be clarified. When this point was raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> the Minister referred to the Air Force Act 1923 to show that the Royal Australian Air Force was a part, of the Defence Forces, and consisted partly of Permanent Forces and partly of Citizen Forces. However, I point out that the word &#34;defence&#34; is not mentioned in this clause. It refers to the &#34;Permanent Forces&#34; and the Australian Imperial Force. The Australian Imperial Force is not a part of the defence forces; it is a war organization. The Royal Australian Air Force to-day consists principally of Citizen Forces, and the point raised by the Minister in connexion with the Air Force Act 1923 was irrelevant. If the honorable gentleman will agree to the proposal of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> to include the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force with the Australian Imperial Force in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> there will be no possibility of any misunderstanding. Will the Minister undertake to do that? It is only a matter of adding a few words. I can see why it was not originally put in the form I suggest. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> enemy aliens and the Citizen Forces are grouped together. That was not accidental.

          <para>. - Two important matters are involved in this clause. One has just been mentioned by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> regarding the position of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. The overwhelming majority of men in these services are neither permanent members of the Navy and Air Force nor of the Citizen Forces. I was Minister for the Navy at one stage of the war, and, therefore, I know a good deal about the conditions of enlistment in the Navy. Most of the men who have been enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force were enlisted for war service only, and they are not a part of the permanent forces of the Navy or Air Force as defined by the Navy Act and the Air Force Act. Men enlisted in the Navy in peace-time for short-term service for a period of seven years or for long-term service for a period of twelve years, and they could not secure a discharge until the specified term had been completed. A somewhat similar scheme applies in the Air Force. Men enlisted in those forces for war service are not enlisted for a. definite term ; they are enlisted to serve for the duration of the war and twelve months thereafter. The honorable member for Balaclava served in the Royal Australian Air Force under those conditions.  His  case provides a flat contradiction of the Minister&#39;s argument. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> was enlisted under the same conditions. Members of the Australian Imperial Force are in a different position. Obviously they are not, and cannot be, part of either the Permanent </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Forces or the Militia Forces. They were enlisted for a specific military object - service overseas. The only similarity between the Australian Imperial Force and the Air Force and the Navy is that, in time of war, members of all three forces are enlisted for service in any part of the world. The definition in this clause does not cover the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force, and it ought to be amended to include them. Last night, the Minister assumed a perfectly sanctimonious attitude in claiming that the bill is sacrosanct. One could have imagined that it had come straight down from Allah on a carpet. Yet he had no sooner made that claim than he brought down a printed list of 34 amendments ! I have never before &#39;seen such a thing in my life. </para>

            <para>- That is so. In view of his pontifical attitude, the committee should declare its acceptance <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> of the 34 amendments. The vexed subject of aliens is as thorny and complicated as could be imagined. Certain aliens came to Australia before the outbreak of the war. Subsequently, some of them were designated friendly and others enemy aliens, despite the fact that they had come from a country which later was at war with Great Britain and Australia. </para>

            <para>- I am not fussy about that. They left the land of their birth, and came to Australia for their own protection. By reason of certain actions by a previous Australian government, &#39; they were guaranteed personal safety and a chance to settle in this country. Doubtless, some of them are worthy people. I am positive, however, that others are not. According to the attitude adopted by the Government, all of them are , to be grouped together and covered by a blanket clause. So far, nothing has been said about certain native forces that were enlisted. What is to be the position, under this legislation,of the aboriginal forces that were accepted into the Commonwealth Military Forces? The Torres Island force was specially enlisted, and received special &#91;fi!&#62;&#93; rates of pay. Then there are&#39; also the Papuan infantry battalion, the Papuan labour corps, and the New Guinea corps. What is to be their position? The Minister has not started the job, for the simple reason that he does not possess a proper conspectus of the forces with which he proposes to deal under clause 4. He does not know either their character or their composition, nor does he realize the implications that will arise from this legislation. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> who has been a Minister for the Army, will recall some of these things; no doubt, some of them occurred in his time. The Minister is attempting to deal with a most complicated problem by means of a foot rule of his own construction. I have a strong suspicion that 34 amendments will not he sufficient, and that he will have to double the number before he proceeds much farther. Whenever we deal with the subject of aliens, we shall be confronted with problems. The clause ought to be amended in the way suggested by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> I served in the first war against Germany, with men who were aliens. Some of them were the beat soldiers imaginable. They came from all parts of Europe. But the conditions that existed in that wai1 were different from those that exist to-day. Before the outbreak, of the present war, there were certain political movements in Europe, some of them above-board and others underground. Certain powers deliberately a ttempted to &#34; plant &#34; their nationals in other countries. Doubtless, Australia did not escape attention in that respect. In this country, some persons of enemy origin were interned immediately the war commenced. The only safe way to deal with the reservists of a foreign power whom one finds in one&#39;s country when war breaks out, is to place them under official control. I believe that a search of the records will disclose that some of the persons interned were subsequently released, and were actually called up for service. If the Minister wishes to instigate a first-class political riot in connexion with the rehabilitation of ex-service personnel, let him try to ram this treatment of aliens down the throat of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia. I believe that he is a member of that body; consequently, he ought to have some idea of the views that it holds. If he has not, I have no doubt that his comrades will enlighten him in due course. </para>

          <para>.- The more I study the bill, the more convinced am I that it has been cleverly designed to confuse the whole issue in regard to the granting of preference to, and the re-establishment of, exservicemen. According to the explanation of the Minister, enemy aliens will receive equal consideration with ex-servicemen in the matters of preference and r establishment. Further consideration of the matter convinces us that the inclusion of the Civil Constructional Corps, and, indeed, any other section which the Minister may care to name, will be permissible. I put it to the committee (hat any preference or re-establishment under a bill of this character cannot do justice to the ex-servicemen if all these heterogeneous sections also are to be included. The only result will- be to confuse the issue. The Minister must have endeavoured to mislead the committee when, in making his explanation to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> he said that preference &#34;was given to aliens after the last war. Surely the circumstances then were entirely different from those that now exist! We did not have a labour corps, or employment companies, and there was no influx of aliens, either enemy or friendly. Certainly, men of other nationalities volunteered and fought overseas in the common war. Being volunteers, they were entitled to the preference which any other fighting soldier received. But the position to-day is entirely different. We are now dealing with men in regard to some of whom dossiers have been compiled. They were drafted into labour battalions, because they were not acceptable to the fighting services, and laboured cheek-by-jowl with old soldiers of the last war. They have <inline font-style="italic">been suspects.</inline> Yet they are to be given exactly the same measure of preference and re-establishment as will be received by ex-servicemen! I repeat that this is a cleverly designed piece of work to confuse the whole issue; because, if the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Government can succeed in throwing into the melting-pot of preference and reestablishment the multifarious elements to which reference has been made, what might otherwise be a privilege to the fighting services will be destroyed. During the debate on the Australian .Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill, I moved an amendment to provide for the granting of preference. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> said to me: &#34;If you are prepared to withdraw your amendment, I give you my assurance that I shall bring down a bill granting preference to exservicemen &#34;. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> accepted that assurance. But I knew only too well what would happen, and refused to accept it, dividing the committee on the amendment. It now appears to me that I took the right course, and placed the correct interpretation on the assurance of the Prime Minister, because this bill will not give preference to ex-servicemen. I do not know whether the honorable member for Henty considers that the assurance was given in good faith and has been carried out. The Minister has not removed all objections by agreeing to accept an amendment suggested by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> Let us assume, as the honorable member for Warringah did, that the cases of two men in employment have to be judged. The honorable member for Warringah argued the matter from the basis that the two were Australians with service of different lengths. I put it on the basis of an Australian and an alien who had worked in a firm. Under this provision an alien could be re-established in his position to the detriment of an Australian fighting man who had .been engaged in an operational area. That would not be tolerated by the servicemen&#39;s organizations and it should not be tolerated by members of this committee. Some acknowledgment, no doubt, should be made of the services of aliens who have worked and fought on our side in this war, but if the Government desires to show appreciation of their services <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> legislative enactment it should provide for that to be done under some other bill. I admit that we should not discriminate unduly in this regard, because  it would be unwise to arouse racial antipathies, but we should not include aliens or, f or that matter, the cooks of the Allied Works Council and the water &#34;joeys&#34; of the Civil Constructional Corps among those to be benefited under a measure designed to recognize the services of members of the fighting forces. </para>

            <para>- The question of what is active service in the case of members of the Naval, Military or Air Forces of parts of the King&#39;s dominions other than Australia would be decided by the authorities in those dominions. The insertion of the words &#34; service in a prescribed area &#34; will ensure that members of the forces of other dominions shall not  derive the benefit of this bill unless they have served in areas comparable with those in which Australians have served. In the opinion of the Government the words &#34; active service &#34;, which in this instance would be interpreted by the authorities in dominions other than Australia, is not sufficiently definite, and therefore we desire to insert the words &#34; service in a prescribed area &#34;. </para>

From the point of view of those to whom the benefits under this measure will accrue it is a matter of little importance ; it merely defines the term &#34; active service &#34;.

          <para>. - The proposal of the Minister for the treatment of aliens is inadequate, in that it excludes only those aliens who were associated with one specific organization. It would be safer to accept the proposed amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> and restrict the benefits of the bill to those aliens who have served in the combatant forces. It is acknowledged by everybody that some aliens, who were unfortunate enough to be born in enemy countries, are better citizens of Australia to-day, and have played a more worthy part in the war effort, than have some reputed friendly aliens. The best way would be to exclude both friendly and enemy aliens from the automatic application of the benefit provisions of the bill, and to give them the right to appeal to such committees as may he formed for the purpose. As the bill now stands, enemy aliens may not only enjoy parity of treatment with Australian soldiers in some circumstances, but they may actually receive preferential treatment. It might happen that an alien, at the time of his enlistment, had a longer period of service with a particular employer than an Australian soldier. Thus, although he served only as a noncombatant, he could receive preferential treatment in the matter of reinstatement over an Australian who had a distinguished combatant record. The attempt of the Minister to compare the treatment of aliens on active service during the last war with those who have served with the forces in this war, is quite beside the mark. </para>

        <para>The Minister did not explain the reason behind paragraph /, which gives the Minister the right to proclaim any organization as one the members of which would be entitled to benefits under the bill. It is obvious that the purpose of this provision is to permit the inclusion of members of the Civil Constructional Corps. Indeed, honorable members will &#39;recall that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> definitely mentioned members of the Civil Constructional Corps, who had been taken away from their homes and sent to work in other parts of Australia. It would also be competent for the Minister, under that provision, to declare mine workers and wharf labourers and others of that type to be essential war workers, and thus entitled to benefits under the bill. This indicates the danger of attempting to legislate for servicemen and nonservicemen in the one bill. I appeal to tho Minister, even at this stage, to reconsider the matter with a view to redrafting the bill so as to confine it to servicemen, those men who - to use a hackneyed phrase much in favour on the other side of the House - placed their bodies between us and the enemy. If he will not go so far as that, I ask him to agree to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> deletion of paragraph /. I am prepared to move an amendment to that effect. </para>

It is idle for usto jump from one point to another; some honorable members wish to refer to one aspect, and other members to other aspects. I draw attention to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the definition of &#34;member of the Forces&#34; which reads - </para>

        <para class="block">It may be said that the mere fact that a person was a member of the Permanent Forces, regardless of where he served or the length of his service, entitles him to special consideration. That is a matter which should be discussed, as it might place a person who served at Victoria Barracks in the same category as another person who was a combatant in an operational area. I hope that the Minister will agree . to take the paragraphs separately. </para>
        <para>I shall now address myself to the Minister&#39;s first amendment. Because of the indefinite meaning of the term &#34; activeservice &#34; the Minister proposes to substitute the words &#34; service in a prescribed area&#34;. He said that service in a prescribed area would cover operations comparable to those in which fighting troops had been engaged. My first complaint is that under the definition of &#34; war service &#34; the whole field is covered, as far as that is possible. My second complaint is as to the nature of the service covered by the term &#34; war service &#34;, which is defined as - </para>

        </list>
        <para class="block">It will be seen thatno consideration is given to the locality in which &#34; war service &#34; is rendered, the nature of the duties performed, or the length of time for which service was rendered. The benefits of this legislation should not be extended to all persons who have rendered &#34;war service&#34; regardless of the length or locality of such service, or the nature of the duties performed. I stress that point because of the necessity to give full force to whatever preference the bill will confer on persons entitled to preference. The Minister has said that the term &#34; active service &#34; is indefinite. In lieu of the definition of &#34; war service &#34; in the bill, I shouldlike to see substituted the definition given in the Defence Act where &#34;active service&#34; is defined as follows :  - &#34;Active Service&#34; - Has a meaning corresponding to that of the same words as used in sub-section (1.) of section 189 of the Army Act defining the expression &#34;on active service &#34;. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In this Act, if not inconsistent with the context, the expression &#34; on active service &#34; as applied to a person subject to military law means whenever he is attached to or forms part of a force which is engaged in operations against the enemy or is engaged in military operations in a country or place wholly or partly occupied by an enemy, or is in military occupation of any foreign country. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If any real preference is to be given to servicemen, my view is, first, that there should be a limit on the persons to whom such preference shall be extended, and, secondly, that it should be limited according to the nature of the service that is rendered. I pin my colours to the definition in the Army Act of Great Britain which I have quoted. Unless there be such a limit, whatever benefits will be conferred by this legislation will prove illusory indeed. A man who served in an operational area for five years will, under this legislation, be placed in exactly the same position in relation to preference as a man who served for three months at some base. A  man in a combatant unit who served in Crete, Greece, New Guinea, Borneo or the Middle East will be placed on the same basis as a man who served in a pay corps at Victoria Barracks, Sydney. Indeed, the combatant may be placed in an even worse position by virtue of the provisions of clause 16. I suggest that &#34; war service &#34; be redefined, so as to make it mean exactly <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> same as in the Defence Act. Then, by limiting the type of service as I have suggested, we shall give more effective preference to the persons to whom the bill is intended to apply. </para>

            <para>- No. The whole of clause 4 relates only to members of the forces. If the honorable member will read the clause again, he will see that there is no possible chance of the Civil Con structional Corps being approved as an organization, to which the . definition of &#34; member of the Forces &#34; can apply. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> once more to deal with this clause item by item. The clause is of 70 lines and is broken up into a considerable number of sub-clauses and paragraphs. It is. a vital clause because it deals with matters which will affect service men and women and members of the civil community for many years. </para>

            <para>- You are speaking of great ruts, but the whole clause is badly corrugated* with bumps all through it. I do appeal to the Minister to meet the wishes of the committee in this respect. Thereby he would be only doing justice to the people, honorable members, the Government and himself. What is the need for this to be hastened through? Why should&#39; not the rights of the soldiers be heeded? Why should the people who for years will be affected by this clause not be assured that it has been properly discussed? </para>

            <para>- All right. First, as regards the amendment to paragraph /, of the definition of &#34;member of the forces &#34; proposed by the Minister under which the words &#34; , or called up for, active service &#34; are  to  be replaced by the words &#34; service in a prescribed area &#34;, the honorable member for Warringah gave the definition of &#34;active service&#34; contained in the British Army Act and made certain quotations from the Defence Act. Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain why Australians who are serving in the forces of the Empire in other parts of the world, either compulsorily or voluntarily, are to be treated differently from Australians serving in. the Australian Military Forces. Is there something wrong with serving the Empire in another part of the world? Must there be discrimination against an Australian who fought under the Canadian flag, the South African flag or the Union Jack in favour of an Australian who fought in the battle of Albury transferring equipment from one railway truck to another? What an extraordinary proposition! I cannot understand why the Minister must rush to his legal officers for advice and then move for the insertion of the phrase &#34; service in a prescribed area &#34; instead of using the words &#34;war service in  His  Majesty&#39;s Forces&#34;. It seems to me that the areas in which men have served meritoriously will be proscribed. I have said before and I say again that the whole bill is cant, humbug, hypocrisy and cheats the soldiers of their rights. </para>

            <para>- I bow to your ruling. It was entirely wrong of me to refer to the bill as cant, humbug and hypocrisy, because it speaks for itself. What do we find when we come to the Minister&#39;s proposal with respect to aliens? The Minister has drafted an amendment which on his own confession will, confer the benefits to be provided under this measure upon enemy aliens serving in the labour companies, or the Civil Constructional Corps or other bodies of the Commonwealth. It was discovered during the war that prior to the outbreak of hostilities the organization of the Nazis was so thorough that they even went to the extent of putting key Nazi supporters  into concentration camps in Germany, anc! after performing certain operations on them, sent them to other countries to act as Nazi spies. Under the amendment, such persons would be able to qualify for all the privileges, including preference, made available under the bill, although, possibly, they may he among the deadliest enemies this country has ever had. Nevertheless, the Minister tells honorable mom bers opposite to accept the bill without criticism. Last night, for instance, we heard the eulogy voiced by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson),</inline> a devoted follower of the Government, who was put clown the drain just as surely as is a dead rat when the flood passes clown to the sea. </para>

          <para>. - As I am anxious to conserve my right to speak on the other matters arising under the clause, I shall direct myself to the amendment before the Chair, that is, the amendment moved by the Minister with respect to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> which includes the definition of &#34; member of the Forces&#34; certain Australians serving in the forces of other parts of the King&#39;s Dominions. The Minister proposes to introduce a limitation on their rights to be included under this bill, the limitation being that such Australians - T emphasize that, such Aus tralians - serving in other parts of the King&#39;s Dominions must have performed their service &#34; in a prescribed area &#34;. And a prescribed area is an area prescribed, under the Acts Interpretation Act, by the Governor-General in Council in this country. Therefore it is prescribed by executive action here. A curious contrast is produced by this amendment. Under the bill as it stands, all members of the Australian forces are within the scope of the bill wherever their service may have been performed. To take two extreme cases mentioned, they are included whether their service is performed at Albury or in New Guinea. In other words, there has been a comprehensive inclusion of all those serving in the Australian forces; and, shortly, we shall be discussing an amendment designed to put some limitation upon that. If that is the position of an Australian serving in the Australian forces - that without any reference to territorial limits or prescribed areas at all he is within the scope of the bill - why should some other rule be applied to an Australian who serves in the forces of some other part of the King&#39;s Dominions? If it is good enough for an Australian serving in the Australian forces wherever he serves to be included in the bill, it is good enough for an Australian native serving wilh the British, Canadian or New Zealand forces to be within the bill wherever he serves. </para>

Therefore I do not quarrel with the intention of the amendment, but with the amendment itself, because service in a prescribed area will give rise to limitations. Areas cannot be prescribed without fixing boundaries, and the moment that is done there will be some people inside the boundaries and some outside; and the moment some people are left outside the boundaries when an area is prescribed, then you have to apply a rule to Australians serving in  the forces of other dominions which does not apply to Australians serving in the forces of their own country. </para>

It is apparent that the wording of the amendment was hastily conceived. I suggest that the following wording would meet the position: - (/) a member of the Naval, Military or Air Forces of any part of the King&#39;s Dominions other than Australia, who served during the war, and was born in Australia or was, immediately prior to his becoming a member of any of those forces, domiciled in Australia: and . . . </para>

            <para>- Obviously, the Government and its supporters do not understand the fundamentals of the bill. In the circumstances, the Government should withdraw this measure and introduce another one which it does understand. Last night, the Minister circulated 34 proposed amendments. My experience in this chamber is that when a Minister intends to submit a number of amendments to a bill, ordinary courtesy dictates that he shall make them available to honorable members without delay, so that they may discuss their effect during the second-reading debate. Last night, however, the Minister circulated 34 amendments in the closing stages of the second-reading debate, and honorable members had no opportunity to examine them. Now, we have made the remarkable discovery that the Minister has just realized that the definitions in clause 4 have an effect that neither caucus nor Cabinet suspected. The position is ludicrous. When moving the secondreading of this bill, the Minister said that it was probably the most important legislation that could be introduced in any Parliament, and expressed his pride at having been asked to introduce it. Caucus should now be asked what it really thinks of the bill, so that honorable members on this side of the chamber may know the position.  </para>

          <para>.- I am at a loss to understand why any measure of discrimination shouldbe introduced, as it has been by the amendment. Clause 4 contains a large number of categories of service personnel who, under the bill, will be entitled to certain benefits. Their rights are not limited by the fact that they served in any particular locality. Paragraphf of the definition of &#34; member of the Forces &#34; deals with another category of Australians who served in the armed forces, not of Australia, but of other parts of the King&#39;s Dominions. Under thisbill, their rights will be limited by the fact that the area in which they served must be prescribed. If an area is not prescribed, the men who served in it will not get the benefits of this legislation. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said, in reply, that the Government intended that those men should receive exactly the same rights as the various classes of servicemen mentioned in earlier paragraphs. If that be correct, why does not the paragraph put the position beyond doubt? It is a simple matter to draft a paragraph that will provide that those men shall receive the same rights  as  all other members of the forces mentioned in earlier paragraphs. It is curious that Australianborn citizens, who are members of the naval, military or air forces of any part of the King&#39;s Dominions other than Australia, should have fewer rights than have enemy aliens or other aliens now serving in the Commonwealth forces. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> should be amended for the purpose of removing any suspicion that the rights of those Australians will be limited in any way. </para>

          <para>. - At the risk of being told once again that I am speaking too often, I desire to make it perfectly clear that this amendment will not mean any kind of discrimination. It will not impose any limitation on the benefits that may be enjoyed under this legislation by a member of the naval, military or air forces of any part of the King&#39;s Dominions other than Australia. In fact, it will mean an extension of the benefits to more people than would obtain them under the clause in its present form. </para>

        <para>I am not aware of the position in the United Kingdom to-day, but I know what it was in the last war. For a member of the forces of the United Kingdom to be on active service during the last war, he had to serve outside the United Kingdom. That is to say, any one serving in the London area, which was mentioned by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> would not, under the clause in its present form, be eligible for any benefits. Therefore the words &#34; active service &#34; should be replaced by the phrase &#34; service in a prescribed area &#34;. </para>

Several other honorable members have said that they cannot understand the need for any amendment at all. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> said that the amendment would limit the application of benefits. I deny this. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the benefits will accrue to a greater number of persons.

          <para>. - The explanation offered by the Minister merely confuses the issue still further. Evidently, he believes that by imposing limits he can widen the scope of the benefits. I confess that I cannot understand that. There must be some form of words which would make the definition acceptable, but the Minister has not found it. I had great hopes of this bill when the Minister, with a great flourish, said that he would accept any amendment that would make the bill better and more workable, but I became suspicious when he himself introduced no fewer than 34 amendments. Nothing that has happened since has removed my suspicions. The Minister has moved an amendment, the purpose of which is to extend the benefits of the bill to Australians who have served with the forces of other dominions in &#34;prescribed areas &#34;. If areas are prescribed, theremust, presumably, be some who have served within those areas and some who have served outside them. Some would be entitled to benefit and others would not. Therefore, the effect of the measure must be to limit the application of benefits. The Minister cannot name one section of the forces which, as the bill stands, will be excluded from benefiting under the &#39;measure. Batmen, cooks. iti embers of the Pay Corps, members of the Legal Corps, those who fought on the Albury front, and those who loaded ships at Woolloomooloo - all are included. That being so, why should the Minister not include those Australians who joined up with the forces of other dominions. We have often heard Ministers say that this is a global war; that it is, in all its phases, one war. Surely it should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Government draftsmen to discover a few words that would give to all Australians who served in the forces of other dominions the same benefits as are to be given to Australians who served in our own forces. As the bill stands there is little in it to afford satisfaction to servicemen. Practically any one can become entitled to a benefit under it. The Minister has said that he is prepared to accept amendments to make the bill better and more workable. Therefore. I appeal to him to listen to the arguments of honorable members on this side of the House, particularly those, who, like himself, are ex-servicemen. Apparently, no member of the Labour caucus realized that enemy aliens may become entitled to benefit under the bill. When this was pointed out to the Minister, he immediately saw the force of our submissions. I appeal to him to abandon his attitude of self-satisfaction, and to meet us candidly and reasonably. He should take the committee into his confidence, and together we can make of the bill something of which he and the Parliament may be proud. </para>

          <para>. -  I hope that- the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> will bear with us when, we submit amendments designed to improve the bill. The Minister has moved an amendment to confer benefits on Australians who, as members of the forces of other dominions, have served in &#34; prescribed areas &#34;. However, no definition is offered of the term &#34;prescribed areas&#34;. The Minister offered an explanation, but he merely contrived to confuse the issue. If honorable members on this side had not raised the point, we should not have extracted from the Minister an admission that he knew that, as the bill stood, enemy aliens were included among those who would benefit under the measure. The fact is that we are not discussing a serviceman&#39;s repatriation bill, but a bill providing for the re-establishment of a great many persons in civil life. Our task is to try, within the framework of this bill, to provide for the needs of exservicemen. We are now discussing definitions, and it is by no means clear who is included in the term &#34; Australian Imperial Force &#34;. I cannot see why a full definition of &#34; defence forces &#34; should not be included in order to clarify the position. The Minister had the audacity to ask where enemy aliens were included in the bill. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the definition of &#34; member of the Forces &#34;, where is there any reference to the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force? It seems that we must be crystal-gazers if we are to learn the Government&#39;s intentions. As the bill stands now, those who will come out best are likely to be those who did least in the war, including enemy aliens. Even supporters of the Government did not know that enemy aliens were to be included in the benefits provided by the bill, and when they joined in objecting to this provision the Minister withdrew it. Therefore, we must be forgiven if we attempt to secure further clarification of the definitions. I have never known a bill in which the definitions have occasioned so much confusion as has arisen from those in this bill. We still do not know just what is meant by &#34; prescribed area &#34; in the Minister&#39;s amendment. I hope that the Minister will take the committee into his confidence and make its real meaning plain. If we knew exactly what was intended, we might be able to insist upon the exclusion from the benefits intended for servicemen of persons who did very little or nothing at all for the defence of the nation. There is a dastardly plot by the Government to extend preference to men who do not deserve it. The honorable member for New England said the bill was like the curate&#39;s egg, but I cannot see good in any part of it. It offers no advantages to the serviceman, because he will have to share the privileges that it confers on him with men who did not fight for the defence of the country.  His  status is merely that of a citizen included with others to whom the Government is prepared to extend benefits. I hope that the Minister will make another and more satisfactory attempt to satisfy us. The definitions are obscure and the whole bill needs clarification. </para>

          <para>.- It is a pity that the bill is not more plain. During the second-reading debate, some of us said that it was an insincere measure, and I still believe it to be so. In the Government&#39;s eyes the civilian matters just as much as the serviceman. The discussions which have already taken place in committee show that the measure is muddled, and some extraordinary revelations have been made in the last hour. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> would have rushed the clauses through the committee stages, but he has been prevented from doing so and, because honorable members on this side of the chamber and one supporter of the Government pointed out that some enemy aliens would benefit under the bill, he offered to make a minor amendment. After considering all of the definitions, one cannot help believing that the bill is badly drafted. The Minister waved our arguments aside earlier, and said that theSolicitor-General had stated that members of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force were included in the Citizen Forces. Surely, in a bill of this importance, to include them generally under the heading of citizen forces is wrong and a slight to both services. The clause merely states -  &#34; member of the Forces &#34; means - </para>

        <para class="block">There is no mention in the bill of the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force. Although the Minister has retired to his corner and obtained an opinion from the legal officers that those services are covered by the term &#34;Citizen Forces&#34;, I am of the opinion that they are big enough and important enough tobe mentioned specifically. I hope that the Minister  will heed my remarks. He referred to legislation enacted in 1923, and said that the Air Force consisted of permanent forces and citizen forces. Does he know that to-day the strength of the Royal Australian Air Force is nearly 160,000 ? The percentage of permanent m embers is trifling, and the number of pre-war citizen  members  is very small. Apart from the fact that the Navy and Air Force should not be passed over in this way, there is a danger of error unless they be mentioned specifically, as the Australian Imperial Force is mentioned. All that is necessary is to name the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the definition &#39;of &#34; members of the Forces &#34;. We are pleased that the Minister has decided to exclude enemy aliens from preference, but paragraph / of. the definition of &#34; war service &#34; giv.es him the opportunity to retract his decision. If the honorable gentleman intends to exclude aliens from preference, he must strike out that sub-paragraph in its entirety. It reads - &#34; War service &#34; means - (/) in relation to any of the provisions of this Act, the continuous full-time service of any person as a member of an organization or part thereof which is declared by proclamation to be an organization in relation to which those provisions apply. </para>
        <para class="block">Unless that paragraph be deleted, the Government could, at any time after the bill had become law, issue a regulation to provide that munition workers, wharf labourers or members of any other organization should be eligible for all the benefits to be given in the bill. I assure the Minister that I am not unsupported in my arguments. The Deputy Leader of! the Opposition has already raised, the point, and ex-servicemen&#39;s organizations are making representations about it. If paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> of the definition of &#34;war service&#34; be retained, we shall always be uncertain as to whether some pressure group may induce the Government, to extend the benefits to its members. There is another minor point to be cleared up, regarding the definition of &#34;active service &#34;. I should like to see preference given only to men and women who served in combat areas. They are the ones who are most concerned with the war. The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act specifically states that a man must have served in a theatre of war, which is the same thing as a combat area, in order to qualify for a service pension. This matter involves Australians who have served in the forces of Great Britain and other parts of the Empire. I accept the Minister&#39;s explanation on this point, because he has pointed out that under the British law &#34; active service &#34; does not mean service in Great Britain. There is no necessity for further discussion on that point.&#39; I repeat that, in my opinion, it is vital that paragraph / in the definition of &#34; war service &#34; should be deleted. Unless the Minister agrees to do that, we cannot believe that the Government will give any great measure of preference to ex-servicemen. I exhort the Minister to mention specifically the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the definition of &#34; war service &#34;. A lot of time would be saved by adjourning the further consideration of the clause, and having the definitions improved by a committee representative of all parties in both Houses of the Parliament. Otherwise, the argument on the definitions may continue for days. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister said that the amendment was designed to widen the scope of the clause. That is perfectly clear. He also told the committee that &#34;active service &#34;,as defined in Great Britain, means service outside Britain. I am quite prepared to believe that his intention, in submitting this proposition, was to remove some limitation which is implicit in the term &#34; active service &#34;. But what he refusesto see is that his proposal does not necessarily mean that, but could mean an increase of the limitation, depending upon the area prescribed. If there is any justification for discriminatingbetween Australians who served under Australian military control andthose who, happening to be on the other side of the world, flung themselves into the conflict under the control of the militaryauthorities of the United Kingdom or another dominion instead of waiting until they had returned to Australia, the Minister has not toldus of it, but rather has accepted the suggestion that there should be discrimination. Lest he consider that there is no discrimination, I shall tell him ofa case that has come to my knowledge. A young architect who was in England at the outbreak of the war, enlisted in the Royal Air Force and did valiant service  with it. His potential benefits under this legislation will have limitations that will not be shared by his father, a member of the Volunteer Defence Corps on the North Shore line. Surely there is no comparison between the service of  a  young man with the Royal Air Force in operations over Germany, and that of a member of the Volunteer Defence Corps who did week-end duty on the North Shore line! I am afraid that a little political dignity is the only thing which prevents the Minister from acceding to what is undoubtedly the wish of the committee. His dignity may be considerably conserved if, at this early stage of the discussions on the bill, he will show a little readiness to accede to the wish of. the committee, and do what, after all, would be a fair thing to those Australians who joined up with the forces of other dominions. </para>

          <para>.- Last night, when the Minister&#39;s action in bringing down  34  amendments to the bill was being discussed by the committee, he, in a happy spirit of conciliation, and a desire to&#62; take the committee into his confidence, said that he would be prepared to accept from any quarter amendments designed to&#39; improve the measure. The amendment, he has submitted to paragraph / of the definition of &#34; member of the Forces&#39;&#34; is not acceptable to me, because although he has told the committee that, his intention is to widen the definition, he is asking it at the same time to pass the&#62; clause in an indefinite state. It is unfinished, because it leaves with the Government the duty of defining the areas in which Australians have served. Somebody must define the areas, and that means, taking in all the oceans and continents of the world. The Minister should accept the logical suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah that paragraph / should he brought into line with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> That would improve the definition and be acceptable to honorable members on both sides of the committee. </para>

          <para>. -  I am at a  los3  to understand why the Minister does not accept the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> It is quite clear that in a certain sense the Minister&#39;s amendment would widen the definition, but the present paragraph is in fairly narrow terms because of the special definition given to &#34; active service &#34; in the Defence Act. What is now proposed is that the Minister should include within the scope of the bill men who were horn in Australia and domiciled here but, being out of Australia, became members of the forces of some other part of the King&#39;s Dominions. They are on exactly the same footing for all purposes as members of the Australian forces who serve as such. There is no distinction whatever. I am certain that the Minister does not desire to make a distinction, and, if so, why should we not use language which, beyond doubt, would put the position of Australians serving in the forces of Canada or New Zealand on the same footing as those serving in the forces of Australia? The committee will wish to include men who answer the description indicated by the honorable member for Warringah. Is there any reason why they should not be included by the simplest form of words that has yet been suggested.? I can see no drafting objection to such an amendment. If the Minister has any objection to it in principle, it is because he desires differential treatment to be given. Honorable members of this committee do not wish that to be done. The amendment suggested does justice to the view of the committee and should be accepted. </para>

          <para>. -  As far as the Air Force is concerned, I have explained to the Minister that there is a vital distinction to-day between every man who was a permanent member of the force before the war broke out and those who have enlisted since. A man who has joined up since the war cannot be given a substantive rank. He can have only a temporary rank, but if he belonged to the Permanent Air Force which existed prior to the war, he could have any rank. The Minister now proposes that the definition of &#34;member of the forces&#34; should include persons who enlisted overseas in other forces and have served in prescribed areas. I shall mention two examples of which every honorable member of the committee has personal knowledge. In  1940,  certain.  persons were asked to enlist for service overseas as yachtsmen and men of that type. They were not to serve with Australian forces, but were to go on active service hunting enemy submarines. Probably the Minister will say that they are covered by the definition. Another force raised in Australia and sent overseas was the Forestry Corps which stayed in Scotland for a long period. The members of that corps did not go into a forward area, but were called upon to do a specific job overseas. </para>

            <para>- The Minister makes that statement without investigation. What were the terms of their enlistment? Other men who were enlisted&#39; for forestry purposes served in New Guinea. The Government does not know what it is trying to do in one sense, but in another sense it knows only too well. It is trying to confuse the issue. Out of the present chaos, two placards stand out prominently. One reads, &#34;Up with the alien&#34;, and the other states, &#34; Down with our own countrymen &#34;. That criticism applies particularly to men who have served with the forces of other parts of the Empire and were not enlisted in Australia. The Minister&#39;s proposed amendment is one of the worst things the Government has tried to do in a very bad bill. The committee should give the fullest possible attention to the position which will confront many Australians who for some reason have served with overseas forces. To my knowledge, and to the knowledge of practically every member of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia, certain difficulties arose after the last war because the rights and privileges of returned soldiers were not correctly defined in the preference legislation of that day. The object of the Opposition is to ensure that there shall be no distinction whatever between Australian men and women who have served the King in any part of the world. If there is any foundation for the practice which we have followed for years past, both before and after the passage of the Statute of Westminster, the cardinal point upon which we must first fix our minds is that for all purposes of war service, it does not matter where an Australian citizen has served. If he has given war service,  whether as a member of the British forces in the United Kingdom, in India, or anywhere else, without any doubt, without any qualifications, and without any chance of doubt or qualifications, he should be entitled to rights at least equal to those enjoyed by every Australian citizen who served in an Australian uniform. The prosecution of the war, has stressed the need for British people of all types, and in all parts of the world to stick together. If, as the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> has said, the Government will be able to varythis measure immediately it has been passed, then that is one of the worst features ever introduced into any legislation. No matter what we may do in regard to this amendment, or in regard to other amendments which may be accepted, it stands to reason that so long as sub-clause 2 of clause 135 remains in this bill, there can be no guarantee of permanency, no protection for the individual, and no security for the group which this legislation purports to cover. For instance, certain changes may take place in this Government. The possibility that we may have a new Labour Prime Minister is being canvassed in the press, with what justification I do not know. But let us suppose for instance that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> were elected to that position. He might desire that certain provisions in this legislation should apply to anybody who did not serve north of the Brisbane line. I emphasize that so long as sub-clause 2 of clause 135 remains in this legislation, there can be no question about the necessity for the Opposition to insist as best it can, upon the inclusion of every safeguard, protection, and guarantee, which the wit of man can devise, to ensure that this bill shall be passed in a form different from that in which we see it to-day. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Warringah has drawn attention to a very important and far-reaching distinction between paragraphf and subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of the definition of &#34;member of the Forces &#34;. I cannot see any logical reason why the Government should not use the same words in paragraphf which the Minister proposes to amend, as are used in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> To my mind the language used in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> is infinitely clearer and more understandable than anything else that has been suggested so far. The Minister no doubt has devoted considerable time to the study of this bill, either personally or by proxy. Because of the manner in which the honorable gentleman rushes to the back of the chamber so frequently, I have a very strong suspicion that that study was more by proxy than personal. As the honorable member for &#34;Warringah has said, this amendment is most farreaching, because it affects the rights and privileges of everybody who may have served outside Australia in the King&#39;s forces. The amendment proposes the deletion of the words &#34; or called up for active service &#34;. I can quite understand that the Minister may believe that these words are not exactly the ones that he would have employed, because for instance, the persons concerned may not have been exactly called up for active service. For instance, a man may have volunteered for service in the British Navy or in another army about, which 1 shall not say anything at present, but the identity of which will gradually be made known. He may have had certain scientific qualifications which prompted him to offer his services to the Government Of the United Kingdom, the Government of Canada, or some other Government. He may have been sent on a special mission to a country which he understood very well. He may not have been actually in contact with the enemy; nevertheless, his work may have been instrumental in saving a great deal of sweat, sacrifice and even bloodshed. The history of warfare abounds with cases of that description. It is unthinkable that the Government should treat this matter so lightly. The Minister has adopted that very pontifical attitude to which I referred earlier this afternoon, as if anything which he says must be final, and cannot be questioned. </para>

The silence of honorable members opposite is significant; not one member on the Government benches has risen to say a word in favour of Australians who joined the forces in other parts of the Empire. The fact that they did so should be sufficient justification for their inclusion in the benefits of this legislation. Until the Opposition pointed out thai enemy aliens would be entitled to preference and rehabilitation benefits under this bill, the Minister claimed that he was not aware that that was so. He now proposes to make an amendment to meet that position. I have a high regard for the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> who has appealed to the Minister to comply with the request of the Opposition, but, so far, his efforts have not met with any response. </para>

            <para>- As the  honorable  member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> ha&#60;pointed out, nurses who have, had service  outside Australia will be treated more generously than will the men to whomI have referred. The Minister cannot justify that discrimination. I am pleased to see the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in the chamber, for I recall that last night, when the Minister in charge of the bill refused the request of the Opposition to postpone consideration of the bill so that honorable members might have an opportunity to consider 34 amendments which had just been circulated, the Acting Prime Minister acceded to it. I, therefore, appeal to him now to grant to Australian men who served in the forces raised overseas the same consideration and the same benefits under this legislation as will be enjoyed by men who joined the forces in Australia. It is regrettable that men who offered their lives for the defence of Australia should not readily be granted the benefits to which they are entitled. If honorable members opposite are determined to discriminate in the way proposed by the bill, their actions will have a boomerang effect. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has in effect admitted that the original drafting of this measure was faulty and that the bill in its present form will not achieve the end which the Government desires. He has, therefore, foreshadowed a number of amendments. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> there is a provision couched in language similar to that suggested by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> The Minister is prepared to concede to women who have served outside Australia as nurses, certain rights that he is not prepared to extend to men who joined Empire forces outside Australia. That is illogical. In the early stages of the European war, numbers of Australians who were then overseas joined forces which were raised in other parts of the British Empire. Some of them did so thinking that an Australian ExpeditionaryForce might not be sent to fight overseas. They were justified in that fear, because they knew that members of the then Opposition were opposed to Australians being sent overseas to fight. I do not want to see those men penalized because they showed courage and initiative in joining forces in other parts of the Empire in order to carry the fight to the enemy. Such men are worth looking after. I believe that it will be a blot on this legislation if we do not concede to Australian fighting men, wherever they fought, the rights and privileges that we are prepared to give to men who enlisted or were called up for service in this country in a time of national danger: Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> reads - </para>

Honorable members on this side cannot believe that the Minister was innocent of the meaning of the definition as he claimed to be to-day.

          <para>- I cannot understand the Minister&#39;s attitude. He says that he is willing to accept an amendment, but he does not say whether he is willing to accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr.Fadden) . There is a difference between the amendment moved by him and the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister. We were led to believe, before the sitting was suspended, that the Minister did not understand what he was doing, that this was a hurried, slipshod measure which he did not understand, but had accepted it in its present form, with the concurrence of caucus, and on the advice of his officers. Now the Minister has come forward with 34 amendments, of which that which he has now foreshadowed is not one. Not one of them has been placed before caucus. This bill is a creaking vehicle in need of 34 additional parts to make it go.So the Minister tries to lead the committee to believe that he did not realize that enemy aliens, perhaps active Nazis, were to be given all the benefits proposed for members of the forces. </para>

            <para>- Very well, I withdraw the word, and say that the Minister has put the committee under a misconception - perhaps that is a neater word - as to the inclusion of enemy aliens in this bill. Honorable members want to be under no misconception in the future, and we demand that enemy aliens in the Allied Works Council or in any non-military establishment or organization shall in no circumstances be included in the bill. I point, out to the Minister that there is a grave doubt whether they cannot be included under paragraph / of the definition of &#34; war service &#34;, and under clause 32. So I have very much pleasure ~ in supporting  my leader&#39;s amendment, and I say to Government supporters that if they desire to protect the rights of Australian soldiers and citizens they ought to make it perfectly certain that the words that the right honorable gentleman proposes to insert in this clause shall be inserted and that, the Minister&#39;s amendment shall not be accepted, because there is a doubt as to its meaning. It is all very well for Government supporters to make a lot of noise, but, the people of Australia want to be sure that there shall be no doubt that Nazis from Europe shall be excluded from, benefits under this hill. </para>

          <para>.- As one of those who bitterly opposed the inclusion of enemy aliens, I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that they shall be excluded. Honorable members opposite are only desirous of making political capital out of this issue. Apparently, representatives of the returned soldiers&#39;&#39; organizations have been in consultation with certain members opposite, who do not mind where it is inserted so long as provision is made to exclude enemy aliens. </para>

          <para>. - I could have understood the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> saying to the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> &#34; I will accept your amendment in the appropriate place&#34;. That would make sense and would not create a precedent, because it has been characteristic of the courtesy of Ministers who have introduced legislation to inform honorable members who have discovered faults in legislation that they will accept an amendment to correct such faults at the appropriate time. But the Minister is not doing that. Let us have a look at the history of this matter. The Minister said, with a great flourish last evening, that he would accept any amendment which he thought would improve the bill.  His  statement is on record. When we entered the committee stage, it was pointed out to him that clause  4  as drafted would give to enemy aliens exactly the same right to the facilities and benefits provided under the measure as is given to ex-service personnel; and he had to admit that he was not aware that the clause made enemy aliens eligible for such benefits. Neither were honorable members opposite aware of that fact, although the  34  amendments proposed to be moved by the Minister were explained to them. As they take more interest in the proceedings they will find one or two other defects of which they are not yet aware. However, as soon as it was shown that enemy aliens would be entitled to benefits under the measure, honorable members opposite voiced a protest, and as the result the Minister decided to amend the clause along the lines of the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> But the Minister, instead of following the course dictated by courtesy, and saying that he would accept the amendment of the right honorable gentleman, has decided to go back on his promise that he would accept any amendment which would improve the bill. He now says, in effect, that any amendments that are worthwhile will be inserted by the Government. Why does he adopt that attitude? Because he does not want it to be placed on record that the Government was so little aware of the real implications of the bill as drafted, that it did not know that it made enemy aliens eligible for benefits to be granted to ex-service personnel. The Government does not want that fact to be placed on record, and,- therefore, the Minister now reserves the right to insert an amendment to rectify an anomaly which has been pointed out by honorable members on this side. Such an attitude outrages all decent procedure on the part of a Minister in piloting a bill through this chamber. I believe that upon reflection he will say to the right honorable member for Darling Downs, &#34; I shall accept your amendment in its proper place&#34;; and, in that case, the right honorable gentleman will withdraw his amendment temporarily, and move it at the appropriate time. </para>

          <para>.- In spite of what the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has said, I ask him to reconsider his decision in this matter. What the Minister proposes to do is to provide something far short of what the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> desires. I interpret the Minister&#39;s amendment to apply to enemy aliens in the Army Labour Corps only, whereas the right honorable member for Darling Downs wishes, in addition, to exclude from the definition &#34; members of the forces &#34; enemy aliens who are employed in labour - companies and non-military establishments or organizations. Apparently, honorable members opposite are quite prepared to allow enemy aliens employed in organizations to which the right honorable gentleman&#39;s amendment refers to qualify for the full benefits under this measure. Honorable members on this side wish to make absolutely certain that enemy aliens in those organizations shall be excluded from benefits under this measure. Surely, the Government can l&#62;e in no doubt about this matter, because honorable members opposite, along with honorable members on this side, have received letters from returned soldier organizations pointing out this defect. The fact that enemy aliens are not excluded has been made known to all honorable members who have taken an intelligent interest in the bill. If the Government has not known of that position, it has not displayed an intelligent interest in the proposals and suggestions made to it by returned soldier organizations, and that fact reveals clearly that the goodwill of members of our fighting forces has not been the first consideration of honorable members opposite. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment of the right honorable member for Darling Downs, and to every honorable member opposite to endeavour to convince the Minister that it is absolutely imperative to accept that amendment in order to close up every possible loop-hole and thus ensure that in no circumstances whatever will enemy aliens be eligible for the preference, rehabilitation and other benefits under  this measure. This is not a matter for the Minister only. It concerns every honorable member opposite. Should they be prepared to sit down and be dumb on so vital a matter, the responsibility will rest on their own heads. There can be no doubt in the minds of honorable members opposite of the issue involved, because they have received communications from returned soldier organizations pointing out the dangers involved. However, only one honorable member opposite has made any sort of a protest, and he has not had the influence with the Minister which. I had hoped he would. The Minister has yielded the minimum in this matter. I object strongly to the bare minimum concession being granted in. response to our request. In spite of the amendment forecast by the Minister provision will not be made to exclude from benefits under this measure enemy aliens who are members of the organizations referred to by the right honorable member for Darling Downs. I appeal to every honorable member opposite to close up that hoop-hole. </para>

          <para>.- The committee is facing a very unusual position. I hate to reiterate the point; but I must repeat that the Minister said he would accept amendments from either side of the chamber if such amendments improved the bill. We have just had an example of pig-headed stupidity as the result, of which the Minister has put the committee in the position of granting rights to women- which he is not prepared to grant to men because he does not wish to give way on the fact that a better amendment than his own was put forward by another honorable member. The result will be that certain things will have to be prescribed in respect of every ocean and every continent on which Australians serve as members of the forces of any other part of the King&#39;s Dominions. The Minister has- admitted that he did not know that enemy aliens were embraced in the benefits conferred by the bill. He admitted that he did not know what, the bill purported to represent. When that fact is pointed out to him by members of the Opposition, be proposes an amendment to cover the one point which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> emphasized., namely, that enemy aliens who were interned in this country, and subsequently enlisted, or were called up for service in labour battalions are by the law of this land members of our Citizen Forces, and entitled as such to the benefits provided under this measure. Now, because of the provision which grants power to the Governor-General in Council to extend the benefits of the bill, such benefits may be extended to other organizations in which enemy aliens are serving and automatically entitle them to these benefits. The right honorable member for </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has added a little to the amendment put forward by the Minister in order to provide beyond all doubt that enemy aliens will not be eligible for these benefits. I am sure that that is what the people of Australia desire. The Minister in fairness to the Parliament and to our ox-service personnel should accept the right honorable gentleman&#39;s amendment. If he does not do so, he will be acting most ungenerously and will delay the passage of this measure for days, whereas we wish to pass it as expeditiously as possible because it is an urgent measure. I appeal to the Minister to act a little more generously, and with a little more flexibility of mind in his approach to this matter. It does not matter whether the better amendment emanates from the Opposition or the Government. The Minister should honour his promise to accept amendments which he thought would improve the measure. Therefore, I ask him to accept this small alteration which will leave no doubt in the minds of the people that what they desire will be provided. The Minister wishes that enemy aliens who are in the Army Labour Corps shall be excluded from the bill. It is agreed by honorable members on both sides that enemy aliens who are fighting for this country should be entitled to these benefits. But we do not wish that any enemy aliens who were called up for service in any other corps or service, such as the Allied Works Council, should receive these benefits. It may be that at some future date, the Government, in exercise of its powers under sub-clause 2 of clause 135, may extend these benefits to members of the Allied Works Council; and I am not sure that the clause now before the committee does not give power to the Government to embrace those bodies. In common fairness, the Minister should accept the amendment moved by the righthonorable member for Darling Downs, and thus make sure that if this measure is extended to any of these other organizations, enemy aliens in those organizations shall not qualify for benefits under the measure. </para>

There were serious objections to the acceptance of the amendment in the form in which it was moved in the preceding paragraph but I do not propose to cover that ground again.

The honorable member for Henty, and members of the Opposition generally, suggested that, at a later date, the Government may endeavour to extend to employees of the Allied Works Council the benefits under this bill. I point out that the Allied Works Council cannot possibly be included within the scope of this clause. The committee is dealing with the definition of &#34; member of the Forces &#34; and has considered members of the permanent forces and of the citizen forces. Obviously, the Allied Works Council has nothing to do with the defence force of the Commonwealth. If the honorable member for Henty cannot see that, he is more stupid than he makes me .out to be. </para>

            <para>- The Minister lost his temper when he tried to explain away points made against him. My only desire is to remove this blot from the bill without delay, and this is the time to do so. The amendment proposed by the Minister does not make it perfectly clear that all the objections to the inclusion of enemy aliens will be met. It is too narrow. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party will satisfy the Opposition, and I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. </para>

          <para>.- This discussion shows clearly that paragraph must be amended. Clause 4 covers all kinds of aliens&#39; who are employed to-day in labour battalions in the Citizen Forces. For my part, I do not mind what particular form the amendment takes, so long as the purpose which we seek is properly achieved. But the amendment under consideration does not go so far as it should go. In my opinion, all aliens, including friendly aliens, should be excluded from the benefits which paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> confers on the persons mentioned therein. 1 shall point out what can happen even if the amendment now under consideration be adopted. The amendment will exclude from the benefits of reinstatement and preference all enemy aliens who are serving in labour battalions, but leaves open those benefits to friendly aliens serving in those battalions. For example, an Australian and a Greek might have been employed, in a particular business. When the Greek was called up, he joined a labour battalion. Six months later, the Australian received his call-up, and entered a combatant unit. In due course, the two men will be demobilized. Who will get preference in reinstatement? Under this legislation, it will be the Greek, because he was called up before the Australian. </para>

            <para>- That is not so. The person who was first called up for service will receive preference in reinstatement. I ask: Is it right that a friendly alien in this case should receive preference in reinstatement over an Australian citizen? </para>

        </continue>
        <para>Then again, a friendly alien - an Albanian or Yugoslav - might serve in a labour battalion doing ordinary manual work. When he is discharged, he will demand that his preference rights shall be implemented. Suppose they are implemented.. It might happen that the friendly alien and an Australian citizen, who worked in a munitions establishment, will be applicants for a job. The Australian, having no preference rights, will not get the job, because the Yugoslav bad served in a labour battalion. If that principle is admitted, that condition of affairs will cause a great deal of resentment among many people in Australia. Justice should be done to aliens who have worked for us during the war; but that justice should be given to&#39; them in ways other than by including them in the provisions dealing with reinstatement and preference. So far as I am aware, no other country gives preference to non-nationals. </para>

If the Minister refuses to accept these words, I say definitely that there can be only one impression conveyed to the members of this committee and to the people of Australia, namely, that the Minister is. deliberately leaving a loophole by which enemy aliens may be brought within the provisions of this measure. I repeat that although the words may be of no use, there is no harm in inserting them in the bill, but if there is any danger of enemy aliens sneaking in by some back door or secret passage, it is the bounden duty of the Minister to include these additional words in the bill. If he does not agree to their inclusion he cannot complain if his acts are judged in the harshest possible manner by the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>.- Apparently the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> credits honorable members with little intelligence. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has&#39; given an assurance that an amendment is to be made to the bill to provide for the exclusion of certain members of the community whom honorable members on this side of the committee, as well as honorable members opposite, desire should not be eligible to benefit under this measure. That assurance should be sufficient for honorable members opposite. It has been said that in the past it has been usual to accept amendments from the Opposition benches, but I have been in this chamber long enough to know that that is not the case. Clauses have been redrafted at the suggestion of the Opposition, and in this case the clause is to be amended to meet the point raised by the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline> and by members of the Opposition. For the honorable member for New England to suggest that the intelligence of honorable members on this side of the chamber is inferior to that of the Opposition is so much nonsense. The people of this country, as well as members of this committee, desire the exclusion of enemy aliens from the benefits of this measure and to suggest, as the honorable member for New England has done, that the Government wishes to provide a loophole to enable enemy aliens to enjoy these benefits is ridiculous. </para>

        <para>The clause as it stands defines &#34;the war &#34; as &#34; the war which commenced on the third day of September, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine &#34;. On that date of course we were not at war with Japan. The original definition was the one used throughout the war, and it was inserted in this measure before victory had been achieved in Europe. That is why this amendment has become necessary. Since hostilities ceased in Europe, &#34; the war which commenced on the third day of September, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine &#34; has ended, and it has become necessary to amend the definition to ensure that the period during which we continue to be at war with Japan shall be covered. </para>

          <para>. - It will be recalled that in my second-reading speech I drew the attention of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to the fact that the definition of &#34; thewar &#34; was not sufficiently wide to embrace the war with Japan. I based that claim on the fact that there were two separate proclamations of war. One was the declaration of war against Germany on the 3rd September, 1939, and the other was the proclamation of the 16th December, 1941, declaring war on Japan on the 9th December, 1941. The Minister acknowledged the fact that the definition as originally drafted was not sufficient to embrace the two wars, and he has now moved an amendment to overcome the difficulty ; but I consider that the definition as amended is still unsatisfactory. The amendment provides for the addition of the following words :  -  and includes any other war in which His Majesty becameengaged after that date and before the date of commencement of this Part. </para>

        <para class="block">My point is that we may be at war with other people in the meantime. After the last war a state of war existed with certain other countries. The matter should be placed beyond doubt, by substituting the words &#34; up to the date of the declaration of peace&#34; for the words &#34;before the date of commencement of this Part &#34;. Some of our forces may still be engaged in active service operations  after the passing of this act, and they would not be embraced by the words &#34; before the date of commencement of this Part&#34;. </para>

          <para>. - I support the suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> This legislation should cover not only the war which commenced on the date mentioned in the bill, but also any other war in which the forces of  His  Majesty may have &#39;been engaged before the final declaration of peace. I have had some experience in this respect. After the last war. certain benefits were given to the members of the Australian forces, including the payment of an additional ls. 6d. a. day for the duration of their service. Two divisions of Australians were sent to certain areas in Egypt and on the Western Front. There were also many &#34; side shows &#34; in Russia and other places, for service in which men were either sent or volunteered, and they did not receive any special consideration on account of that service. We should make it clear that the actual declaration of peace shall be the final date, in whatever war we may be engaged. There is no certainty that the wars with Germany and Japan will be the only wars in which we shall be engaged. Our armies in Europe are facing to-day elements which may cause an outburst, at any time. At Trieste, there are all the elements of a further outbreak of hostilities. Lebanon is in a similar category. Our nien might easily be embroiled in trouble in such places. Within the last few weeks, men have been sent out of Australia as reinforcements. We want to make sure that they will be in the same position as the men who have served for two Or three years, in regard to entitlement to share in the &#39;benefits provided by this legislation. The men who served in &#34; side shows &#34; in Russia and the Middle East after the last war did not get any credit for that extra service of five or six months. That was most unjust. Irrespective of whom we have fought, if we send our men to fight against an enemy, or allow them to do so, they should receive the same benefits as the men who have served in the two major wars. </para>

After the last armistice, Australian troops took part in operations in Kurdistan, and British forces took part in operations in Afghanistan. One needs no imagination to foresee the possibility of further conflict on the continent df Europe, even though Germany has been defeated. Let us hope that it will not happen. We should, therefore, not neglect the opportunity that we now have to extend the date up to the declaration of peace, so that any action may be covered. Young men who have recently gone into action after a long period in Australia may be detained in foreign parts as garrison troops after the enemy has been defeated.

That was tho; experience after the last war.. As the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> has pointed out, small &#34; shows &#34; broke out in many parts of . the world. There are danger spots in the world to-day, and war might easily occur after the main hostilities have ceased. It would he grossly unfair to exclude the men in the Royal Australian Air Force who might have been enlisted after the date mentioned, and might not have been fighting in the two wars, but had been engaged in a &#34; side show &#34; subsequently.

            <para>- We cannot say for certain that there will not be other conflicts. This measure has been described by Government supporters as the charter of the ex-serviceman. It is only logical that it should apply to service in the future, without a definite date being fixed. I should like the Minister to give a reason, if there is one, why that cannot be done. </para>

I am not seeking to secure for them entitlement to re-establishment in employment, because they were given that long ago.

Will the Minister say whether the rights of those men will be affected-, or does he propose to ignore them? Will he ride roughshod over the men of the 1914-18 war ? Perhaps he has no knowledge as to whether their rights are prejudiced under these proposals? The observations of previous speakers regarding his stubbornness seem to be justified. Either he is completely ignorant, on this matter or he is gravely discourteous to the committee. I do not intend to record a silent vote. Has the Minister any knowledge of the position? </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for  Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has raised an important matter which cannot be left clouded in uncertainty by silence on the part of. the Minister or the Government. The committee has had no word from the Minister as to whether the benefits to be conferred by this measure are in whole or in part applicable to those who served in the 1914-18 war. We are not in a position to debate the merits of the matter, because the Minister has not indicated whether the Government intends to include those ex-servicemen. In the absence of an explanation by him, the committee must assume that he proposes to exclude them. I pointed out that the repeal of certain legislation which gives some protection and rights to those who served in the 1914-18 war is proposed in this bill, because other provisions supposedly giving an equally satisfactory result are embodied in the measure. If what is proposed to be done will have the effect of excluding those who were to benefit under the existing provisions, the committee should be told what the position, is, but the Minister remained ungraciously silent following the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth That honorable member did not make an attack on the Government, but merely sought information. Any Minister in charge of a bill is under an obligation at any time to inform the committee of the significance of provisions on which, it is asked to vote. The Opposition merely invites the Minister to state clearly what the policy and intentions of the Government are. Unless he can state thom distinctly and forthwith, he will not save any time in the discussion of the measure, because members of the Opposition are determined that they shall l&#62;c advised as to the Government&#39;s policy regarding this matter. </para>

          <para>.- I urge the Minister to break down his oyster-like silence. The debate will proceed more satisfactorily if he refrains from sidestepping real issues. Clause 22 provides for the repeal of section 117 of the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act, and in clause 23 an amendment of the Commonwealth Public Service Act is proposed which deprives members of the First Australian Imperial Force of certain preferences granted to them. Owing to the silence of the Minister, members of the committee cannot ascertain whether the protection now enjoyed by members of the Australian Imperial Force will be preserved. </para>

If it is not adequate we could make it so; but the Minister sits, grinning like a chimpanzee, although this is an important bill which affects the welfare of the members of the fighting forces in the last war as well as in recent wars. Members of the Opposition represent servicemen engaged in the present war, and they are entitled to the information needed to enable them to know exactly the significance of the Minister&#39;s proposals. The Commonwealth Public Ser vice Act affords special consideration to members of the Commonwealth Public Service who fought in the last war. Certain sections of the Post and Telegraph Act provide that a person who has served continuously in the Commonwealth Public Service for two years shall be entitled to permanent employment, but it is proposed under the bill to delete those provisions and leave the ex-servicemen high and dry. I want to he satisfied that we are not taking away from members  of  the First Australian Imperial Force those advantages, privileges and concessions which were granted to them in other legislation. Unless that assurance can be given I desire that the definitions in this clause be amended so as to guarantee their rights to members of the First Australian Imperial Force. I ask the Minister to break his silence, and to give the assurance for which I ask. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> seems to think that if any of our troops are engaged in sideshows after the main hostilities end it will be time enough then to consider whether they should be included among those who will benefit by this legislation. In this connexion, the experience of some soldiers who served in previous wars has been unfortunate. There were several sideshows after the last war. For instance, two cavalry divisions were kept in Egypt and the Middle East for five months after the last war officially ended. Many of the men served in the Western Desert, including the Halfaya Pass area where our soldiers of this war served. They did not receive any gratuity. </para>

            <para>- Because the Government of the day decided that the war had ended on the 11th November, 1918. Many of the men to whom I refer were still serving abroad in July, 1919. Some of our men volunteered for the service in Russia and others were sent. A personal friend of . mine named Sullivan was among them. Unfortunately, he was killed in an accident in London. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry while serving at Archangel, and I am told that he never received one penny as a war gratuity for his service in Russia. The Minister should agree to an amendment providing that men who serve in any war in which His Majesty&#39;s troops are engaged are entitled to all the benefits under this legislation and to war gratuities also. </para>

          <para>.- After listening to what the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> has just said, I am convinced that he and the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> are not justified in saying that they are here as representatives of the returned soldiers. The honorable member for Moreton was an assistant Minister at one time, but it appears that he let the returned soldiers down very badly. The honorable member for Bendigo has told us that Australian soldiers who were left behind after the last war to continue the fight were denied war gratuities and other benefits when they returned to Australia. When the honorable member for Moreton speaks of himself as a representative of the returned soldiers I invite him to look at the figures for the last general election which reveal just what the returned soldiers thought of him and his party. The bill provides that any one who served in the forces prior to the 3rd September, 1939, or since that date, will be entitled to benefit. </para>

            <para>- It might be possible to include all sort3 of organizations. However, I am directing my remarks to a serious matter which is not to be dealt with by vulgar interruptions. The question to which I direct attention is whether civil organizations ought to be capable of being brought within the scope of this legislation. Having regard to the language used there can be no doubt that it is designed that civil organizations will, by mere Executive act, be brought into the same category as military organizations for various purposes in this bill, and, in particular, for reinstatement. Consequently, the question which was debated on the second reading arises, namely, whether we should have in the one bill provisions which deal with soldiers and provisions which deal with civilians, and, in particular, whether the same set of provisions on any topic in this bill should embrace both soldiers and civilians. &#39;On that point, a number of honorable members have expressed their views, as I have done. Therefore, I shall not engage in wearying repetition. But as I indicated in my second-reading speech, there will be no adequate protection of the soldiers under this scheme if soldiers are to be confused with civilians, or with civilian bodies, instead of being kept distinct and their affairs administered by people who understand them, and will give to their individual claims sympathetic consideration. But the matter does not end there. Reference has been made - and I refer to it now, not because I wish to discuss a clause out of its turn, but to throw light on this clause - to clause 135, which provides in sub-clause 1 in. fairly stock form for the making of regulations. It then goes on, in subclause 2 to provide that - </para>

It is certain that ait least during the currency of the war,  which  may be for a considerable period of time, the Executive may not only exorcise the power contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> of the definition of &#34; war service &#34;, but may also produce new powers and write them into this clause. </para>

            <para>- Theoretically, either House of the Parliament could disallow any regulation made under clause 135, but in view of the strictly party divisions which have taken place in the committee stages of this bill, I ask the honorable  member  what he thinks of the prospect of any such regulation being disallowed. That means that two elements are introduced into this clause; first, that which is introduced directly by paragraphf, which provides positively for a power in respect of a civilian body, and, secondly, the inevitable implication arising from clause 135 that during the war the Executive may write further paragraphs into this clause at its own choice. That gives rise to two questions, each of which is deserving of an answer in connexion with this paragraph. The first question is whether we ought to have civilian organizations confused with military organizations in legislation of this kind; and. the second question is whether we ought to have the scope of a major bill made dependent, not upon the definitive voice of the  Parliament,  but upon uncontrolled Executive action. Without any desire to occupy undue time on  this  matter, I urge the committee to reject paragraphf. </para>

          <para>. - I listened with interest to the explanation given by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> If paragraphf has been designed for the purposes mentioned by the Minister, I ask him to name those organizations in the paragraph, so that we may know exactly how far it is proposed to go. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said, paragraphf is related to clause 12 and also to clause 135, the latter of which gives to the Governor-General power to make regulations for various purposes during the period of the war. When I recall the history of this bill, I naturally am suspicious of this paragraph. Honorable members will remember that, in the first instance, the Prime </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> promised, when I moved an amendment to the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill designed to include therein a provision that members of the forces should be given preference in employment on demobilization, that a bill to provide for preference would be brought down. The bill that has been brought down limits that preference to seven years, and the preference that the returned soldiers will get under it will be of no value whatever to them. So much therefore for the assurances of the Prime Minister! Next, I invite honorable gentlemen to examine the history of the government behind the Government - the leaders of the trade union movement. Look at the, opposition shown to this bill by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Workers Union, the Trades and Labour Council and the Victorian Labour party. We know that the bosses of the industrial unions are also the bosses of the Government. Therefore we have good cause for suspicion. If the Minister&#39;s explanation is as simple as it appeared to be and is the true explanation, why does he not name in the bill the organizations that are intended to be brought within its scope, instead of leaving it so vague that it will be possible for other organizations to be included. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Workers Union have already claimed that munitions workers should be given the same privileges under this measure as are tobe given to returned soldiers. No honorable gentleman opposite would deny that, and, if munitions workers are to be catered for in this way it will be but a short step to include members of the Civil Constructional Corps. I believe the clause is designed to enable certain organizations to bebrought within the ambit of this measure at a given time and that those organizations will he decided not by the Minister but by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions which controls him and before which he appears time after time to explain, for instance, why this bill has been introduced. Honorable members remember that he went to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and told it that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> had threatened to throw the Government out on its neck unless it introduced preference to returned soldiers. It is the government behind the Government  that  will direct the Minister as to which organizations should be covered by this clause. Unless the Minister is prepared to specify in the bill the organizations that he has in mind, in other words, &#34; come clean &#34; on this occasion, I for one will divide the committee. There is a wealth of logic in the  case  put by the Leader of the Opposition. He has placed his finger on something which requires more than an assurance by the Minister that paragraphf applies only to the Young Men&#39;s  Christian  Association and similar organizations. If those organizations  are  worthy of inclusion - and some of them are - they should be specified in the bill and not left to conjecture. It should not be possible for the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Workers Union or the Trades and Labour Council to give the Minister  a  direction which he will be spineless enough to accept, as he has  done  on other occasions. </para>

          <para>. -  I just want to say that, having regard to the fact that a vote has recently been taken which terminates the particular discussion, the Minister falls into great error about the course of this debate.Clause 4 is not just one clause out of 135. Clause 4, being the definitions clause, determines the whole scope of this legislation, and it istherefore quite inevitable that avery great deal of the discussion in the committee will be on the clause which determines the scope of the measure. In those circumstances to think that any important question raised - and the Minister will give me the credit of saying that I have raised no frivolous questions on. this bill - can be adequately considered in two or three speeches is justnonsense. Paragraphf of the definition of &#34;war service &#34; to which I was referring before therecent interruption is explained by the Minister as affording accommodation for the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Salvation Army and the Young Women&#39;s Christian Association. If the object of paragraphf is to accommodate organizations of that kind, then there isno conceivable difficulty about saying that the organizations referred to are those mentioned and any other like organizations which may be proclaimed. It presents no drafting difficulty whatever to do that. The fact that the Minister is not prepared to do that, and retains words which I assert to the committee are equally capable of referring to theCivil Constructional Corps, or the IronworkersUnion, is conclusive evidence- </para>

          <para>. -  I shall heap coals of fire on the head of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> by endeavouring myself to answer the question raised by the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir</inline> Frederick Stewart) because the Minister has not answered it. This clause makes certain provisions in regard to &#34; a prescribed part of the King&#39;s dominions other than Australia, or of a prescribed foreign power allied or associated with His Majesty &#34;. That would cover various powers which have fought as allies of ours. In my view, the subsequent words, &#34; or of any prescribed foreign authority recognized by His Majesty as competent to maintain naval, military or air forces . . .&#34;, arc intended to cover various committees of resistance which have fought with the Allies in the course of the war, such as the committee headed by General de Gaulle in London, who led a committee of resistance engaged in rallying Frenchmen. It might turn out that under his banner there served somebody who was out of the service before France as a power was restored to the conflict. Consequently, if the clause provided only for&#39; men who had served with a prescribed foreign power, a number of men who had served with recognized committees of resistance might be excluded. Therefore, the clause has been made sufficiently wide to cover British forces wherever they might have been, troops of allied powers wherever they might have served, and also troops who served under authorities of the kind which I have described. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>Section 118a of the Defence Act was designed to prohibit an employer from preventing an employee from serving in the Australian Forces. It provides -  (1.) An employer shall not prevent any employee and a parent or guardian shall not prevent any son or ward from rendering the personal service required of him under parts III. and IV. of this Act. </para>
        <para class="block">Sub-section 2 provides* that an employee shall not be prejudiced in his employment by the fact that he was engaged on compulsory military training. This clause relates to sub-section 3 of section 118a of the Defence Act which provides that the rendering of personal service shall not terminate a contract of employment, and that such a contract shall be suspended during the absence of the employee, and so on and provides that that sub-section shall be inoperative insofar as it is inconsistent with the reinstatement division of the bill. Why is the word &#34; inoperative &#34; used ? After all, if this bill becomes law and there is a provision in it which is inconsistent with some provision of the Defence Act, I take it that that provision of the Defence Act will be repealed to the extent of that inconsistency. The use of the word &#34; inoperative &#34; suggests that the clause is not designed to repeal that provision of the Defence Act, but to suspend it in some way until this measure ceases to have effect. If that is the position, I am satisfied, but I should like to be sure that that is the position. </para>

As he said, certain provisions of the Defence Act are inconsistent with the objects of this measure because they would prejudice the re-employment of a returned soldier. We do not wish to repeal a sub-section of the Defence Act, but merely to render inoperative the provisions of. that legislation which are inconsistent with this bill, so that a soldier seeking reinstatement will not be prejudiced. </para>

        <para class="block">The point that I am making for what it is worth, is that clause 20 appears to confer the power to appoint a reinstatement committee with a type of personnel  aa  though a start was being made, whereas clause 9 presents  a  ready-made committee, with its personnel determined, and says that it shall be deemed to have been set up under the later provisions of the measure. I suggest that that is not a very sound way of doing such things. If the Parliament is to consider unfettered how a reinstatement committee ought to be constituted, its hands should be left untied. For example, honorable members might come to the conclusion that, under clause 20, a reinstatement committee should consist of more than one representative of servicemen, or more than one representative of employers, or that it ought to be constituted in some other fashion altogether. If they do, they will find when they reach clause 20 that under clause 9 they have already validated the appointment of reinstatement committees on a basis utterly different from that which they might want to establish.  iSo  I suggest to the </para>
        <para class="block">Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> that, in order that the committee may &#39;be enabled to deal with the matter without restriction, it would he wise to defer the consideration of clause 9 until after the consideration of clause 20. </para>

          <para>, -  The object of this clause is to ensure that authority for the work already done and now being partly done under the regulations, shall be embodied in this legislation. We do not want to have nullified what has been done and is now being partly done. Already, notifications have been issued to employers of the readiness of certain ex-servicemen to resume their former positions by a certain date. I do not consider that any harm will be done by making provision in regard to reinstatement committees in two clauses. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> will not be prevented from moving for the amendment of clause 20 should he desire to do so. The deletion of this provision would be dangerous. . </para>

The Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has proclaimed it a perfect measure, unlike anything else in heaven or on earth. That is perfectly true. Never has there been, and I hope there never will be again, any measure like it. It was not created overnight but is the result of months of work. The Minister has designated it a charter for the servicemen of Australia, upon which they will be able to look back with satisfaction. Only last night, Government supporters claimed that it needed no amendment. Yet suddenly this and 33 other amendments are brought down without a word of explanation, and we have to accept it, not by logic but by faith. The Government has brought it down; therefore, it must be right and we are not to question it. The Minister explained earlier that the permanent forces include the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. I should like to know whether this clause deliberately and specifically excludes members of those services. </para>

            <para>- The whole hill is shabby and tawdry, but it is glossed over with a view to inducing the people to believe that it means what it does not mean. When one wants to discover the interpretation of it, one has to study the report of a conference of the Victorian executive of the Australian Labour party on the 30th March in newspapers like the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> No ministerial explanation is given. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has asked, how does one reinstate a soldier in permanent civil employment ? Such a person may have been born in an army barracks, and have had no civil occupation. Yet, under this carelessly drafted legislation, he is to be reinstated in civil life! The Minister&#39;s interpretation makes one wonder whether he gives any consideration to the statements that he makes to the committee. He told us last night that the permanent forces include the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. Apparently, they do not. One moment they do. and the next moment they do not. There should be an explanation of the reason for the inclusion of this provision in the first place, and for the present proposal to delete it. Would it, if left in, damage the effectiveness of the legislation, and will the servicemen be assisted by its deletion? Ministers are treating the committee, and the people of this country, very poorly. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Germany, were enlisted or appointed on a permanent basis. The intention of the definition was to make it clear that members of the regular permanent forces were not covered, by the reinstatement provisions. However, since it now appears that early in the war certain enlistments were made to the permanent forces from civilian ranks, it has been decided to omit this definition, as otherwise those men would be debarred from claiming reinstatement. So far as other members of the permanent forces are concerned, there can be no question of reinstatement, as they had no former employer. Some of those who, as the result of the war, were enlisted in the permanent forces from civil occupations, will be discharged from them and will want to return to their former avocations. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment would be dangerous and I oppose it. It might be harmful to men discharged from the services, and in some cases discharged with ignominy for offences which to the civilian mind were not very serious. I have details before me at present of the case of a man now imprisoned in Long Bay gaol. He committed a crime, under provocation, which in civil life would be no crime at all. As far as I can ascertain the facts, he struck a superior officer in a detention camp. I admit that it was a serious military crime, but in civilian life it would be regarded as a comparatively minor offence. Many men are now languishing in civil gaols in Australia for military crimes which would be considered of small consequence in  a  civil court. </para>

During the last  war  many members of the British Army were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for military offences, but when the war ended they all were released. Members of the Australian forces who have committed offences should, of course, be punished, but it is unjust to carry their punishment into their civil life, particularly when the offence would be regarded as a very minor one if committed by a civilian. </para>

The effect of this would be to make it a condition that those who were to benefit under the act should have received an honorable discharge from the forces. That brings us to a consideration of what constitutes  an  honorable discharge. A man&#39;s discharge could be held to be honorable even though he had been convicted of an offence of the kind mentioned by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> if, in fact, he had not been courtmartialed for a major offence. If he has committed a major offence it is only right that the prospective employer should know of it. .Such a man should not be entitled to the same benefit as the man whose service has been in all respects honorable. </para>

Otherwise, this legislation may be invoked to gain for him entry into a firm where he could take advantage of his  position to rob bis employer. The Government is not prepared to take any risks in the case of men to whom it lends money. It is provided that they must have received honorable discharges, but it says, in effect, that the private employer must look after himself. The arguments which honorable members opposite have used about hounding down the man after he has served his sentence for an offence apply with equal force (to those who would benefit under clause 89 of the bill-that relating to the making of loans&#39;. The protection which the Government proposes to confer upon itself in regard to lending money should be extended to the employer for the safeguarding of his assets and those of shareholders, and also to protect the interests of other employees. </para>

          <para>. - In order to help the Minister to overcome his hesitancy, I  point  out that clause 89 is not the only one in which it is provided that persons must have an honorable discharge in order to obtain benefits. This condition is laid down also in clause 62, which deals with the granting of re-establishment leave. If ,it is desirable to protect the authorities in the case of re-establishment leave by imposing such a condition, it is much more important to afford the protection to the prospective employer, and to protect other employees from displacement by persons who should not benefit under the legislation. </para>

The amendment proposes that he shall be entitled to this benefit only if he has received an honorable discharge. Clause 27 provides for preference in employment for ex-servicemen, but it is laid down that preference shall not be extended to a person who has, since the termination of his service, been convicted of an indictable offence. If it is right to make such a condition apply in the case of employment, it is only logical to apply it also in, the case ofl reinstatement. </para>

          <para>. - As the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has pointed out, my amendment, if accepted, would make for uniformity. I point out to the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> that a serviceman may be court-martialed for a very minor offence. Indeed, for anything but the most trifling offence, he may choose to be tried by court-martial rather than be dealt with by his commanding officer. The offence which would disqualify a man for an honorable discharge would be a criminal offence for which a man would receive the full punishment prescribed by the civil law or some extremely serious service crime. The old form of: discharge stated whether the conduct of the serviceman had been &#34; exemplary &#34;, or &#34; very good &#34; and so on. The form has been altered, and the  present discharge makes no reference to conduct at all. I was asked whether anything could be done to protect the good soldier from the really &#34; bad hat &#34;. On?  man told me that his firm had engaged, through the man-power authorities, an ex-serviceman who stole from his fellow employees, and then cleared off with valuable stock, the property of the firm which had been very good to him. There is nothing in the present discharge, form to indicate that a man has committed even the most heinous- offence. </para>

            <para>- Any one who has been the commander of a unit knows that many of the cases which come before him are of  a  trivial kind. Yet, as the clause stands,  a  man who has committed murder would be put in the same category as a man with a good record. Such a man would not have an honorable discharge. I shall not press the amendment, but I point out that the bill is not uniform. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia will not accept a man with a bad record of this kind. </para>

        <para class="block">That seems to fix only the time of the termination of his service, and does not appear to have anything to do with employment, and therefore the question of an honorable discharge does not arise. When I was Minister for Repatriation in a previous government I found that there was a provision in the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act that proof of satisfactory service had to be submitted before a returned soldier could be employed. Satisfactory service involves an honorable discharge. I suggest that the Minister should look at the clause again; and, should he find that what I have said is correct, I am confident that he will agree to accept the amendment to insert the word &#34;honorable&#34;. </para>

        <para class="block">Read in association with clause 12, this provision means that a man who has completed a period of war service, or service in an essential industry, is allowed only one month within which to apply to his former employer for reinstatement. Many men whose war service has terminated will be so glad to be free that they will not realize how quickly the time will pass. A period of three months would provide them with an opportunity to settle down and come to a decision. This is an amendment which the Minister may safely accept. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, and also a corresponding amendment in clause 12. As I understand clause 10, it relates to a man who after a period of war service does not go back to his former employer and apply for reinstatement, but instead takes some other job which comes within the definition of &#34; essential work &#34;. If he goes to a job of greater national importance than his former job within one month of completing his war service, his rights to reinstatement in his original post are preserved to him, whereas he would forfeit his rights of re-engagement if he were to take another job for purposes of his own. I agree with that principle; the Minister has done well to incorporate such a provision in the bill. But the time limit is important. The man is not to have the protective advantage of that provision unless he has engaged in &#34; essential work &#34; within one month after the completion of his war service. Similarly, under clause 12 he must within one month of completing his period of war service apply to his former employer for reinstatement. There is unanswerable force in what the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> has said. On the termination of his war service, a man will not be likely to work to a time table and say &#34; I must do certain things within four weeks After several years of war service he may take may weeks to &#34; find his feet &#34;. If, say, two months after his discharge he undertook some essential work and then went to his original employer and applied for reinstatement, he might be told that he was a month late, and had forfeited his right to reinstatement. If that happened it would be a grave injustice. A similar position might arise under clause 12, but it would be simpler. He would have to be a man of remarkable aplomb to remember, after several years of war service, that he had to sign, on the dotted line within four weeks of his discharge. The amendment is reasonable. No one will be prejudiced by increasing the term from one month to three months, but a great many men will be prejudiced if the term of one month be retained. I am sure that the Munster will see the merits of the amendment, and will accept it. </para>

            <para>- In this clause, we are dealing with that vast body of men who have rendered &#34; war service &#34; but have been discharged during the period of the war, many of them on medical grounds. Some of these men will not feel physically fit to assume the full responsibilities associated with their former employment for weeks, or even months, after their discharge. Therefore, the cases which are likely to arise under this clause may bc more difficult than those which will arise when men who do not suffer any physical disability are demobilized for ordinary routine reasons. I cannot find anywhere else in the bill that persons who are discharged on medical grounds and are unable to resume work for a period of longer than one month because  of  physical disability, are protected  in  respect of their reinstatement rights. I hope that the Minister will clarify the position of those discharged because  of  some physical disability who may be prejudiced if expected to resume  work  one month after their discharge. </para>

It will have to look ahead to see what provision it must make for their reinstatement. If it is to be kept ignorant for three months of the number seeking reinstatement, it will be unable in the meantime to engage any one permanently. That would place the firm in an invidious and difficult position. </para>

The Minister referred to the power of a reinstatement committee to extend those times. Clause 21 gives power to extend the times specified in clauses 12, 13 and 14, but not clause 10. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but even a canny Scot ought to be able to see the justness of the proposition and accept it on the spot. 1 agree that there should be some time limit because, otherwise, men could apply for reinstatement six or twelve months after discharge, but I suggest that one month is too short, and that, without difficulty, the period could be extended to three months. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> drew attention to tho case of men discharged on medical grounds who may not know whether they will be able to take reinstatement. Perhaps they will not know what they want to do. The time limit must be extended to meet their needs. Men who have been at the war for five or six years will not want to make a sudden decision on whether they require reinstatement. They will want to look around. One month is too short. The Minister mentioned a difficulty in regard to firms, but I see none. He knows that discharges are made unbeknown to firms or any one else. </para>

          <para>. - This discussion has provoked two unusual circumstances, one, the concern of the Minister for large firms, and, the other, support of the Opposition by the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard).</inline> My contribution to the discussion will be a reference to clause 62 which deals with reestablishment leave and provides that men with clean discharges shall be entitled, after six months&#39; service, to 30 days&#39; leave, which is the precise period in which they must apply for reinstatement in order to conserve their rights to reinstatement. Clause 62 provides that men may be discharged before starting their 30 days&#39; leave. There is real danger, as was said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the honorable member for Baas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> that if the period in which reinstatement must be lodged is limited to one month, men who fail to moke application will unwittingly forfeit their right to reinstatement. </para>

            <para>-It is unfortunate that some members of the Opposition cannot follow the excellent example of their leader, but insist on snarling in such a way as to invite the defeat of their amendments. Those are foolish tactics. If the Minister, as the result of his reconsideration, is able to extend the period to three months, it will be more valuable to the discharged men than will the period of only one month. As the Minister is unable at the moment to agree, I think we should be satisfied with his undertaking to reexamine the clause. Possibly, if he cannot agree to three months, he will be able to agree to1 two months, but I feel that there is every reason why the period should be extended. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister not to interrupt. I predict that many scores of men wilD forfeit their right to reinstatement unless the time be extended. The Minister and all honorable gentlemen know that the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia understands what it is talking about when it asks that the period be extended. After the last war many men were de mobilized abroad. That may happen again. Many may not know of this provision in time. Others may go on leave for three months or so and overlook this requirement. Others may be discharged from hospitals, and very often the repatriation machinery does not work ae quickly as it should. I am sure thai the Minister for Repatriation (MrFrost) will agree with that statement. Many men are kept going from this office to that office, and they may just overstep the time limit and lose their rights in the matter. No one wants to see that happen, but that is more than a possibility. I cannot imagine employers taking the stand which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has predicted. I am sure that the Chamber of Manufactures or the Chamber of Commerce would not do so. The Minister has spoken about demobilization and has pictured large numbers of men approaching the bigger firms. Demobilization will be spread over the Commonwealth and the proportion of ex-service personnel applying to one firm at one time will not be very great. The Minister says that he will consider the amendment. I urge him to accept it immediately and thus provide a  very  valuable benefit foi thousands of servicemen. </para>

What amazes me is how the Government hopes to administer a scheme of such dimensions as that embodied in the bill when. at the same time, it regards the granting of a little concession such as this as an insuperable difficulty. Apparently, in spite of all the advisers available to the Government, this is a difficulty which cannot be overcome. However, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has promised to consider the matter and, if need be, have the amendment inserted in the Senate.

Even the suggested extension to three months may not be adequate in respect of such eases. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to take into consideration the sort of case which can arise in this category, and, if necessary, insert a special provision to cover cases of men who can establish that they have been discharged on medical grounds, and that for a period in excess of three months they have not been physically capable of making the necessary application, or resuming their former employment. </para>

This case was brought to my notice only last night. It is that of a young man who, when he was discharged, was told by the service medical officers that he was not to do any work for six months. He was not given any sustenance or pension. He was just told that he must live on his parents for the next six months. I can produce that man to-morrow morning should the Minister desire me to do so. Therefore, it is useless for the Minister to make statements of the kind he has just made. We can beat him on them every time. The Minister cannot get away with it.  His  statement is not true.

          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">-This</inline> clause can operate quite contrary to the merits of a case. It provides that should two persons previously employed in the one establishment, and both of whom qualify under the war service provisions, claim the one job, the claim of the person with the longer service with the firm at the date of the enlistment of the first of the two men to enlist, shall prevail. Lt- is possible that the person first to enlist might be a young man who spends five or six years on active service as a combatant, whereas the other person competing for the same job might have enlisted much later, and in a noncombatant service, or if he joined a combatant service might not have left Australia. Yet the latter could claim preferment , under this clause. Provision should be made, as has been done with respect to the preference clause, that&#39; the employer may exercise discretion based on the length and nature of the service of the claimants. \. know that there are difficulties with respect to this provision in relation to preference, but no greater difficulty will exist in applying the same principle under this clause. By doing so, we shall prevent gross injustice from being dentin many cases. </para>

          <para>. - This clause provides that when several persons apply to a former employer to be reinstated, the employer shall give preference to the applicant whose length of service with the employer was the greater at the date when the first of the applicants to enlist commenced his period of war service. This provision can cause a great deal of injustice. I shall cite a case typical of many which have been brought to my notice and, no doubt, to the notice of other honorable members. Although <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> shall use fictitious names the facts cannot be disputed. Of two men, whom we shall call Smith and Jones, Smith has, say, three years service with his firm prior to enlistment. He is- a married man occupying a good position, and has a family. In 1940, France falls and leaves the Empire alone in the struggle. He is prepared to throw up his position, and his family life in order to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. Jones, on the other hand, is a man with ten years&#39; service with his employer, and his position is comparable with that held by Smith. But Jones does not enlist. He is a single man. He hangs on to his job, and, in fact, influence is exerted on the manpower authorities to enable him &#39;to keep his job. In. 1942, he is veritably dragged &#34; screaming from the tart shop &#34; and put into the military forces. What will happen when Smith returns? We must admire his spirit, but when he applies for reinstatement in his position, Jones, because he had eight years&#39; service with the firm before Smith enlisted, will get the job. If that is an instance of what will happen, many injustices will be done throughout the Commonwealth. In country areas, where the fact of such cases will be known, trouble will arise between the individual and the firm, and will  spread  throughout the district. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Minister should carefully examine this clause. I realize that the contention can be advanced that in certain instances, seniority should count. Because of certain circumstances, some men could not enlist, even if they had been willing to do so. But to the class of case such as that which I cited, there is no reply. The Minister should adopt one of two courses. Either he should delete, in subclause 4, the words &#34; whose length of service with that employer was the greater at the date on which the applicant &#34;, or the matter should be determined by a reinstatement committee after an examination of all the facts. Perhaps the second course would be the better one. The employer should not be required to judge between applicants for a position. </para>

          <para>.This is a very important clause, because it gives virtually an automatic right of reinstatement to persons who come within the definition of &#34; war service &#34; in clause 4. Therefore, I direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the committee has already, in clause 4, defined the categories of persons who will become entitled to reinstatement. One weakness of the bill in its present form, is that the definition of &#34; war service &#34; has been left in such a loose and unsatisfactory manner. That condition was the inevitable result of the Minister&#39;s refusal to hear what honorable members on this side of the chamber desired to say about clause 4, and to accept some proper limitation upon the looseness of the phraseology which occurs in it. </para>

            <para>- I can show very readily that I am doing so. What I am putting to the committee is that, because of the way in which the words &#34; war service &#34; have been defined in clause 4, virtually no limit is placed on the categories of persons who can be included in this right of reinstatement. If under paragraph / of clause 4 (1), the Government chooses to proclaim any industrial unions which had taken part in the war effort, and groups such as merchant seamen, civil air pilots, munitions workers and iron workers, which might be claimed to be within a &#34; protected &#34; industry, then, as the definition of &#34;war service&#34; now reads, those persons will be entitled to benefit under the reinstatement provisions of this bill. If that is to be the case, and 700,000 persons in civil employment are given reinstatement privileges, it will defeat altogether any substantial protection for the discharged serviceman. Therefore, the whole bill in general, and this clause in particular, carry the taint of the ill-defined term &#34;war service&#34; which the committee has already adopted. </para>

        <para>I turn now to another aspect upon which, I hope, the Minister will be able to enlighten me. A correspondent has cited a particular instance, and I consider that it is covered by the provisions of this clause, but my correspondent and I would be reassured if the Minister would confirm it. It is one of a typical group of cases which will arise, and which, I assume, the clause seeks to meet. My correspondent, who is the principal of a firm of chartered accountants, wrote - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I should say, at the commencement, that as a returned soldier from the last war I am most sympathetic with any proposals to repatriate service men and women. </para>
          <para>In the case of my firm, at the outbreak of the war our staff consisted of four girls and eight men and youths. The whole of the male staff enlisted or were called up and from time to time other males, whom -we have appointed to our staff to take their places, have also joined up or been called up. Our staff now consists of two youths of under eighteen years and four girls. It is obvious that, with this reduced staff, our business must have contracted considerably, otherwise we could not have carried on. We are, therefore, faced at the present time with a reduced business, a staff reduced by 50 per cent, in number and by considerably more than 50 per cent, in efficiency, and it appears to me that it will be quite impracticable for us to take back all service .personnel who were formerly employed by us. The principal reason is that there will not be the work to give them. The former repatriation proposals appear to me to have been quite workable and fair; but the present proposals would appear to be unjust to employers, such as ourselves, who have been unable, owing to loss of  staff,  to maintain their businesses at their previous levels. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I ask the Minister to note that two points arise in the details supplied by my correspondent. First, there is the fact that employees of the firm enlisted and were replaced by male personnel who, in turn, enlisted. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I consider that any attempt to meet the special case which the honorable member cited would create far more anomalies and difficulties than it would resolve. If the suggested amendment were adopted, and the applicant who first commenced war service were given prior right of reinstatement, the effect would be that&#39; the person reinstated would usually be a single man. The explanation is that in the majority of cases, the single man joined the forces before the married man with a family enlisted or was called up for military service. </para>

            <para>- To refer such a matter to a reinstatement committee without setting out any principle to guide it, would be to adopt a cumbersome and unsatisfactory method, which would cause considerable delay. In these matters, we must lay down one principle and abide by it. The best principle which we can choose, if we must choose one, is that of giving the reinstatement to the man whose length of service with the employer waa greater at the date on which the first person enlisted. </para>

          <para>. - I support the amendment. Remuneration is not the only consideration in this matter. Yesterday in Melbourne an address was given at the Legacy Club by  a brigadier of the 6th Division, Australian Imperial Force. The  speaker  pointed out that that division had served for six years and asked for some relief. When the men of the Sixth Division return to civil life, they will be concerned with more than mere remuneration. They must be given the promotion which they would have received but for the war. Some employers might not favour the reinstatement of these men in their former positions, and the same attitude may be taken by unions. Recently, a strike occurred at Lysaghts Newcastle Works Proprietary Limited because employees objected to the status which was given to a returned soldier upon reinstatement. I am sure that no honorable member will support that. Acceptance of the amendment will be evidence of the sincerity of the Government in regard to this clause. I hope that the Minister will accept it. </para>

            <para>- Actually, there was no necessity for any reference to remuneration at all.

        <para>In relation to the suggestion made by the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> concerning sub-clause 4, it must be remembered that the honorable member is dealing with only one category of employers, namely, employers who will find them selves unable to reinstate all their former employees who are entitled to, and seek, reinstatement. In view of this Government&#39;s policy of full employment, there will be very few employers in this country who will not be employing more men after the war than they were before the war started. Therefore,to the degree that that policy can be implemented, this problem will not arise. Adoption of the suggestion by the honorable member would mean that a firm which found itself in the unfortunate position of being unable to reinstate all its former employees would be landed with the lees experienced employees to carry out its business in very difficult circumstances. That is a sufficiently strong reason to justify my refusal to accept the suggestion. </para>

            <para>- Speaking for myself and from my own experience, I quite agree that it is the practice to take amendments of which notice has been given in the order in which they come in the clause ; but let us suppose that amendments of which notice has been given having been disposed of, the committee then goes back to the question whether the clause should stand part of the bill. On that question any honorable member is at liberty to speak. Supposing also that at that stage it seems good to the committee to consider and pass an amendment which, up to that time, had not arisen, are we to understand that the committee, though it may discuss the clause, cannot at that stage make any amendment to it? That, in my opinion, would be making a rigid law of a long standing rule of convenience, and would mean that, the amendments circulated, having been disposed of, the committee could simply take the clause or leave it, butcould not alter it. I submit that the ruling goes too far, and that in the absence of any other honorable member desiring to move an amendment, it is competent for the honorable member for New England to submit one. </para>

          <para>. - I draw attention to what seems to me to be a curious feature of this clause. It may be that I misapprehend it. The clause says this- </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Where an employer has reinstated a former employee in accordance with this Division  . . he shall not, except as required by sub-section (5.) of section sixteen of this Act--  which does not matter for  this  purpose -  or without reasonable cause, terminate  the  employment of that employee or vary it by--  making the terms less favorable. The part to which I direct attention is &#34; he shall not, . . . without reasonable cause, terminate the employment of that employee &#34;. I can quite see the reason for some such provision, because it would never do to allow an employer to evade the substance of the law by taking a man back into his employment and very shortly afterwards terminating it. Something has to be done to prevent that. But I am not at all sure that the clause has not gone too far. Take the case of a man who, prior to enlistment, was employed from week to week, perhaps in a very casual way, in an employment which, in its nature, was casual employment. He returns and is reinstated. By virtue of this clause, it would appear that his employment would be completely changed in its character, because the employer would be bound to continue him in employment, and not to terminate the employment without reasonable cause; and without reasonable cause would mean that the man&#39;s employment would become permanent, subject to a right to determine it for what the law would describe as &#34; reasonable cause &#34;. So the effect, in many instances, will be to convert casual employment into what is essentially permanent employment. That, I consider, is not necessarily a good idea. It may, as a matter of fact, produce very great hardship in many cases; because many employers of casual labour would not employ the volume of such labour that they do employ were it not for the fact that it is casual. Therefore, what the legislation proposes to do is to alter the whole nature of the employment. My feeling on the matter, which is not very clear-cut, is that we would have done well to make some saving in this clause in respect of employment which was really casual in character, because I doubt very much whether it was ever the real intention of the Government to make such a change in the nature of the employment, after reinstatement, from what it was before enlistment. I want to make it quite clear that I recognize: the necessity for a safeguard. There should be no real loop-hole left for a man who desires to evade the obligation of the law. But I should be grateful if the Minister would have a look at the matter in the light of what I have said, and discuss it with the parliamentary draftsman, in order to determine whether or1 not the clause does go so far, and, if it does, whether anything can be done to change it. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that there will be no watering down of the important safe-, guards provided in the clause. The points made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> have no weight&#39; against the overriding necessity for the protection of servicemen in their employment against unscrupulous employers who, having been compelled to take men back into employment, will often taken advantage of* any pretext for dismissing them. The Leader of the Opposition considers that the words &#34; without reasonable cause &#34; may provide too strong a safeguard, but, in my opinion, the strongest possible safeguard is necessary to ensure that employers shall discharge- their obligations. The words used in the clause seem to me to be entirely necessary, because employers, aided by brilliant lawyers, often take advantage of any loop-hopes in legislation. </para>

It is proposed to extend to two years the period during which the obligation will rest upon the accused person to prove his innocence. For my part, whenever it can be avoided, I have &#39;always been against requiring an. accused person to prove his innocence. In the bill, it is provided that the onus of proving his innocence shall rest upon the employer for six months, and that is reasonable. After the expiration of that period, there will still be no lack of opportunity to prose.cute but then the principle will apply that the accused person is regarded&#39; as innocent until he has been found guilty. </para>

The remaining case, that of the Wycheproof Shire Council, has been delayed because it was found necessary to obtain further information from the council. This information has now been furnished and an early decision is expected. With regard to the general question of delays in these matters, I emphasize the detailed investigations and checking required. The payment of public money is involved and every care must be taken by the authorities concerned. However, I assure the honorable member that the need for expeditious handling of claims is appreciated and every effort will be made to avoid unnecessary delays. </para>
