Under standing order 193, a motion moved by anyone other than a Minister cannot be put to the House before 12.30 p.m. So we are in the technical position that the motion moved by the honourable member for Bennelong and seconded by the honourable member for Mayo to suspend Standing Orders technically cannot be put until 12.30 p.m. However, the House has voted to bring on the question. If there is no objection from either side, I would propose to put now the question that Standing Orders be suspended on the basis that to put off a motion after the House has decided that it wants to call it on would be a bit of a nonsense. We would just have to come back at 12.30 p.m. and vote on the motion. There would not be any intervening debate because the question that the question be now put has been passed. So if there is no objection, I will put the question&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to present to the House the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. This is the second report in a series that the foreign affairs subcommittee is making on Australia's relations with countries in its immediate region. In 1989 the subcommittee reported on Australia's relations with the South Pacific, and next year it expects to complete an inquiry into Australia's relations with Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry on Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea is by far the most comprehensive and wide ranging inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea ever undertaken by an Australian parliamentary committee. The recommendations, if adopted, would have the effect of greatly transforming our nation's relations with Papua New Guinea, thus leading to a substantial broadening and strengthening of those relations. Inquiries such as this into the basis of the whole relationship are, of necessity, wide ranging and complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea has been a long one, having been interrupted by the election of May 1990. The terms of reference covered economic issues, including trade, investment and aid, and political, strategic, social and cultural issues. Experts and interested parties from all these areas spoke to the Committee in the course of over 18 public hearings conducted throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report takes into consideration the often divergent views of the inquiry's many witnesses and tries to set them into an historical context. The Committee's report is based on the following overall historical assessment: Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea is governed by the fact that we obtained it as a colony in a burst of strategic nervousness, just as we ourselves were seeking decolonisation. We were therefore diffident colonisers who governed with casual practicality and who departed with alacrity and too little care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategic concern which motivated the acquisition of the colony in 1883 remains a constant factor in the relationship, coming as it does from our geographic proximity. A lingering sense of responsibility bred of our rapid departure governs our commitment to aid. Over the last 15 years we have developed many formal ties and relationships. Officially the relationship is given top priority and it has worked smoothly, albeit with questions arising about the processes involved in aid and defence cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's major concerns are about the effectiveness of our aid in supporting Papua New Guinea's nation building, a process that has slowed, and about the instability of Papua New Guinea, which is evident in the secessionist movement on Bougainville or the political, social and economic disruptions of crime and corruption. Unofficially, at an institutional and personal level, the relationship has been weakened by time. Here there is scope for strengthening it and for re-humanising it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain issues consumed much of the Committee's attention. These were Australia's position and role as a major aid supplier to Papua New Guinea, the defence cooperation program and the strategic considerations which prompt this program. Furthermore, the problems on Bougainville were of great concern to the Committee. The Committee believes that these are central issues to the relationship and that they are issues that need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Bougainville, there is a need for urgent resolution. Given the current delicate stage of Papua New Guinea's economic and social development, the Committee believes that it would be wrong to withdraw too hastily from our aid obligations in support of Papua New Guinea. These are obligations that extend from the days of colonial administration and particularly from the failure of successive Australian governments to prepare Papua New Guinea sufficiently for independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low standards of education and health remain as a legacy of that neglect and these factors continue to retard Papua New Guinea's development. The Committee therefore believes that Papua New Guinea is in a crucial stage of its development and that the next 10 to 15 years will be vital in seeing the benefits of the rich resources of the country successfully applied to infrastructure and other developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason the Committee believes that aid must be maintained at nominal levels for the next five years. Furthermore, there should be no automatic formula for the reduction of aid by the year 2005, and only significantly higher than expected returns from resources should alter such an arrangement. Furthermore, no such changes should occur without adequate consultation with Papua New Guinea or without sufficient planning time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received a large number of recommendations urging changes to the development cooperation program. The Government has already initiated some changes, but the Committee believes that the current proposals should be modified. The key recommendations on aid are as follows: the Committee recommends that Budget support should be replaced by program aid, supported where necessary by project aid. The move from Budget support to program and project aid should be undertaken as a matter of urgency, commencing in 1993 or as soon as possible thereafter. During the transition there should be a mix of Budget support and program and project aid, with the former being phased out by the end of 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that negotiating projects and programs involve greater administrative complexity and absorb large amounts of scarce high level managerial capacity, the Committee recognises that there may be delays in the implementation of this recommendation. If that occurs the total level of aid should be maintained through continuing Budget support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The choice of program areas and designated programs should be based on sound, long term economic and social policies and be determined after close consultation between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It is important to explain what we mean by this system of program aid. If aid is to be maintained, it should also be targeted more efficiently to areas of need. Present negotiations seem set to convert the existing Budget support into project aid. The Committee does not believe that it is realistic to maintain nominal aid levels and, at the same time, convert this successfully into projects. Projects have a long lead time, are administratively complex and require high level managerial capacity. Therefore, the Committee supports a system of program aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Program aid is defined as the funding of a sector, such as the education sector, with a view to meeting predetermined objectives in a given period. It is a form of aid that would have definite goals, would be monitored each year, would involve non-government organisations, might encompass projects within the target area and would involve long term funding commitment additional to, and not a substitute for, normal Papua New Guinea funding of the sector in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that this last factor is most important if there are to be improvements in Papua New Guinea's infrastructure. The process of consultation between Papua New Guinea and Australian governments will also be a vital factor in the success of this system, particularly in ensuring that the targets are met and that the process remains within the power of the Papua New Guinea Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much media attention has been given to security issues in Papua New Guinea. The evidence put before the inquiry certainly confirmed that the problem is serious. It is a twofold issue. There is lawlessness and violence in the towns and villages, which create fear and inhibits development, and there is the movement on Bougainville for secession, perhaps the most destabilising and intractable problem Papua New Guinea faces. Both these problems have focused attention on the weaknesses within the defence and police forces, the need for better training and more discipline, and an understanding of the need to protect human rights in dealing with civil disorder or disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions have prompted a review of expenditure on defence generally. The Committee understands the decision of the Papua New Guinea Government to rationalise its expenditure on security through joint training, joint logistics and more cooperative arrangements for the use of personnel. There is the difficulty that a small nation has in finding adequate funding for the training and equipment of two separate forces. However, there are dangers in the merging of the two functions of domestic policing and external defence, and the Committee believes that these dangers need to be addressed by the defence cooperation program. There is scope within the training offered by Australia for some stress on humanitarian law and civic duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bougainville in particular has revealed the problems that Papua New Guinea faces in the future, problems of maintaining national integrity, problems of the recognition and satisfaction of the nationalist aspirations of groups within the country, problems of investment and resource development, problems of land ownership and compensation. The isolation of Bougainville has gone on for too long. Too little is known about the real cost in terms of human suffering and loss of life over the last two years. Too little effort seems to have been made to find a solution to get talks started and to stop the blockade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the Australian Government could and must do more, despite the reservations expressed by various witnesses who saw the Australian involvement precluded by defence arrangements and commercial interests.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also argues strongly that the time has come to pay close attention to the cultural and social aspects of the relationship which have become sadly neglected. There is more material about that issue in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, let me say in conclusion that this report recognises the many strengths that exist in the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea, a formal relationship government to government that rests on regular consultation and review. However, there is scope for an extension of the informal connections, the educational, the cultural and the social exchanges. We are urging a wholesale transformation of the aid relationship and many other things. In all there are 56 recommendations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am extremely gratified by the fact that, with the exception of one minor dissent,<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> this report has been adopted unanimously by the foreign affairs committee and the full committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was indeed a most comprehensive inquiry and report into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is chairman of the subcommittee said, it is the most wide ranging investigation ever undertaken by an Australian parliamentary committee into our relations with Papua New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our recommendations are adopted, they will no doubt greatly change Australia's relationship in the future with that country, with which we have had a very special relationship for many years. The report covers four major areas. It looks at political and social developments within Papua New Guinea; its economic issues; security issues; and Papua New Guinea's relationships with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two major issues in this report which I would like to address. One is Australia's attitude to aid for Papua New Guinea and the other is the Government's handling of the Bougainville situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea is the largest of the Pacific island countries to our north, with a land area of 462,000 square kilometres and a population of about 4 million people. It is the second largest nation in the South Pacific in terms of population and it has demonstrated in recent years a leading role in the South Pacific Forum. Papua New Guinea is also richly endowed with natural resources and its significance in the South Pacific region, plus its strategic importance to Australia, makes it a most significant nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore a great mystery why Australians, especially since PNG independence, have little real interest in this nation to our north and regrettably the media also has not given PNG the significance it deserves. Consequently, a number of our recommendations cover not just the need to improve the relationship between the governments of Papua New Guinea and Australia but also the need to improve media and journalistic contacts, the establishment of links between professional bodies and organisations, the establishment of an Australia-Papua New Guinea council and various other major initiatives which at the human level are so significant in creating the infrastructure necessary for a worthwhile relationship between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is, of course, Papua New Guinea's largest importer, although Japan is in fact its largest source of exports. However, our relationship is and always has been primarily concerned with assistance. This will reduce over the 1990s in the context of the economic development of Papua New Guinea and in particular the development of new mineral and oil projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea is a former colony of Australia. When it achieved its independence in 1975 it had little economic or financial substance on which to base its new-found political independence. Putting it quite simply: Australia gave independence to Papua New Guinea too early and our economic and social infrastructure support took place too late. It was only in the last decade before independence that any worthwhile activities in that direction were taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the lack of economic and financial development on which it based its new-found political independence has not in many respects held back the development of that nation, although it has brought with it major social strains which were earlier referred to. As I said, with the benefit of hindsight I believe that Australia did leave too soon and that is why we still have to have an aid program which is effective in maintaining the degree of social and economic cohesion which that nation clearly needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given direct grants to Papua New Guinea of some $3.7 billion out of a total of $4 billion since 1975. However, the Australian Auditor-General has found that these funds have not been spent effectively and that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite $4 billion in aid assistance by Australia . . . real living standards for most of the population are lower than those for comparable developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Putting it quite simply: the record is not satisfactory. That Budget support has not been effective led the Committee to recommend that a new approach to development assistance be considered. The Government is currently looking at replacing Budget support with a substantial project aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the National Centre for Development Studies, project aid has problems in that it is hard to absorb, the recipient country loses control and, more directly, Papua New Guinea's absorptive capacity for foreign financed investment is limited. Consequently, the Committee recommended that Australia provide program aid to PNG for certain programs with objectives to be set in advance and to be met and adequately monitored each year for the results. We also recommended that the amount of aid given to PNG be continued for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the question of aid is not the only issue in Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. The most recent controversial issue which comes to mind is the situation in Bougainville and the part the Australian Government has played, or perhaps more accurately has not played, in that crisis. Not only did the PNG Government use Australian helicopters to put down the revolt but also the copper mine was developed by an Australian company and had Australian staff. We should not lose sight of the fact that it was the opening of that copper mine which was the essential reason why the revolt developed in that important province of Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have referred to that revolt as the most serious threat to PNG's internal stability. That is a fair comment because if it was successful in the longer term there is every prospect that there would be other attempts by diffuse groups within the Papua New Guinea nation to seek their independence also. Consequently, in our opinion, Australia's reaction to the crisis was unsatisfactory. The Government did not act to help find a solution to the conflict between Bougainville and the central Government. This was especially stark in the light of the successful efforts of the Australian Government to date in helping to find a solution to the war in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea is our closest neighbour and the Government did not act to help. The Government gave the PNG forces helicopters so they could be used to assist with the operations on Bougainville. The armed forces of Papua New Guinea were equipped and, to some degree, trained by the Australian Government. Therefore, in the minds of the Bougainvilean population there was a clear nexus or link between the PNG Government and Australia's role in the overall situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has found that the helicopters were used in a way which contravened the conditions under which they were donated. They were used to fire at people and to dump bodies into the sea. We recommended that on providing military equipment to PNG the Australian and PNG governments should develop clear and agreed guidelines about how the equipment will be used. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in its evidence stated that the Bougainville Republican Army was, `very suspicious of Australia and its role'. That is understandably so. The Australian Government supplied PNG's forces with weapons and transport, so they see us as having a direct responsibility both in creating the crisis and perhaps in trying to solve it. This will have long term implications for our relations with both Bougainville and the PNG Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government should at least urge the PNG authorities to lift their restrictions on humanitarian aid to Bougainville as soon as possible. This raises the question of human rights abuses. The Committee was presented with some evidence of these abuses having taken place on both sides in Bougainville. In addition, Amnesty International has already detailed some 50 cases. Legal redress for such abuses in Bougainville is currently non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended that the Australian Government do more to encourage PNG inquiry into these abuses and in consultation with the PNG Government to explore ways in which Australian aid might be used to enhance safeguards for human rights protection. The main conclusion which has come out of this report is that the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea has weakened over time and the understanding that neighbours should have of each other has also weakened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As PNG's stature grows in the region we should be maintaining a close relationship built on continuing dialogue and negotiation. It is a strong, wealthy and independent nation and as it becomes more independent and stronger we should be there to help to work to ensure that the human, individual and cultural contacts are not lost. </PARA>

As has been said, this is one of the most comprehensive and wide-ranging reports into Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. I also believe that the recommendations, if adopted, would lead to a substantial broadening and strengthening of the relationship between the two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have to appreciate that Papua New Guinea is a sovereign independent state. Some people giving evidence to the inquiry seemed to think that Australia could act as if it were the colonial master. We cannot do that. What problems Papua New Guinea has must be solved by Papua New Guinea but this is not to say that Australia cannot or should not help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, anyone who has been to PNG or who follows developments in the country cannot help being concerned about the internal law and order issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a concern shared by the Government of PNG and one that it is attempting to address. Until the matter of law and order is fully addressed it is doubtful whether PNG will reach its full potential for investment or tourism, both of which could be significant contributors to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support the recommendations made in regard to aid, in that Budget support should be replaced by program aid, supported where necessary by project aid. The choice of program areas rests on sound, long term economic and social policies and should be determined after close consultation between Australia and Papua New Guinea. I stress that matter of close consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guinea has one of the fastest increasing population rates in the world. That country will never achieve its full potential unless the population question is tackled. The birth rate is now over 3 per cent a year. The Committee recommended that Australia offer a specific project to the Family Planning Association of Papua New Guinea in order that it might develop and promote comprehensive services on birth control. This aid could be delivered either through an expansion of current non-government organisation services or through an AIDAB health project. We should also encourage the United Nations Family Planning Association to be involved. There is little doubt that many of the problems of PNG can be traced back to the high birth rate. As a member of the executive of the Asia Forum on Population and Development, I am sure this organisation would also be prepared to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the mining operations that have an impact on the Torres Strait be carefully monitored and the Committee has made recommendations in this regard. Having visited the Ok Tedi mine with the Committee and seen the waste that goes into the Fly River, I have serious concerns about the possible impact on the Torres Strait. Both countries should be concerned that the waste and the overburden that is going down the Fly River could have an impact on the fish and the fishermen of the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with other members of the Committee that we have to work to maintain the good relationships that we have had with Papua New Guinea.

As other speakers have mentioned, PNG is a vital nation in the South Pacific. After Australia, it is the second largest nation in the region. Its contribution to the development of political and social thought in the South Pacific and the immediate region is of untold future importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report seeks to deal in detail with the issues confronting the relationship. Hopefully, it has done so with a degree of impartiality and a lack of political bias. I believe that this has done much to recommend the work of the Committee not only in this inquiry but in other inquiries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the main essence of the report is its outline of how the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea has changed. There is no doubt that the special relationship, remembered by people in the older age bracket, that was developed between Papua New Guineans&mdash;the fuzzy wuzzy angels&mdash;and Australians during and shortly after the Second World War <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>is breaking down both in Australia and PNG as time passes. Something needs to be done about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting section in chapter 5 of the report deals with people to people links. Two paragraphs in this chapter headed `The Media&mdash;Perspective from Papua New Guinea' and `The Media&mdash;Perspective from Australia' are very important in the sense that they outline the real need for both individuals and organisations to develop closer relationships. The recommendations for the exchange of personnel are most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The birthrate in Papua New Guinea has been mentioned as one of the major problems confronting the nation in the future. I would certainly agree with that. Children have to be educated and given meaningful employment. It seems to me that that is the main task confronting future governments of Papua New Guinea. Australia should be playing a significant role in assisting successive governments of PNG to deal with this extraordinarily difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers in this debate have mentioned the very apparent problem of law and order and this has been dealt with in some detail in chapter 4 of the report under the heading `Social Developments in Papua New Guinea'. Without going into the detail, the ramifications of the breakdown of law and order touch just about every aspect of PNG society and affect very markedly the future successful prospects of PNG development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very evident when one travels to PNG that attention needs to be paid to increasing communication activity and developing transport between parts of that country. PNG is an enormously difficult country to get around. But if it is to successfully achieve its potential, obviously more attention is going to have to be paid to the communications difficulties of all sorts. Again, Australia can play a most significant role in helping in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to deal with a report of this length and complexity in five minutes. Suffice it to say, I believe that the report requires close study and I hope that the recommendations will be adopted by the Government. In conclusion, I would like to thank very sincerely all the staff of the Committee who, over the years, have been associated with the development and compilation of the report. Their work has been magnificent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to commend to the House the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I would like to begin my remarks by thanking the staff of the Committee by name because they have done a particularly fine job. They are:  Judy Middlebrook, Margaret Swieringa, Celeste Conlan, Denise Picker, Margaret Gibson and Margaret Brown, and the two consultants, Rowan Callick and Matthew Nuhaus. One can see from the length of the report just how substantial their work has been. Also, one can see from reading the report the high quality of that work. On behalf of every member of the Committee, I thank them very warmly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make just three points in the remaining four minutes that I have to speak to the report. The first is that the essential theme of the report that human contact between Australia and Papua New Guinea must be upgraded is absolutely right. During the last 15 years there have been a fracturing and a deterioration of those human contacts. These contacts were very strong during the Second World War and the colonial period. Once independence had been achieved, Australians tended to withdraw&mdash;and quite properly, in many senses. But I think Papua New Guineans would welcome greater contact between the two countries. Also, Australia would benefit from this greater contact. It is that human contact which will ensure that relations are good in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes many specific recommendations about the ways in which that can be achieved&mdash;through secondment of people in business;  through more travel by journalists, including staff of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; through greater publicity by government departments linked with programs in Papua New Guinea;  and by the establishment of an Australia Papua New Guinea council. I think the establishment of this council is one of the very important recommendations. Such a council could become a focus for business and cultural organisations with all kinds of links. The Committee recommends increased cultural exchanges and parliamentary visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make relates to maintaining aid. The Committee runs against the conventional wisdom in saying that nominal levels of aid should be maintained for the time being. I believe that is absolutely correct. There are enormous problems in Papua New Guinea and that country needs the funds at present. Without those funds from Australia, Papua New Guinea will not be able to upgrade its police force, upgrade its education system, increase its attention to agricultural extension and build improvements to the infrastructure which are the requirements of continuing development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until Papua New Guinea gets increased revenue from mineral exports, Australian nominal aid must be maintained. If that additional revenue builds up, there may be scope for cutting aid and that is something that both countries would welcome. No-one likes the kind of dependent relationship which aid creates. But until that happens we must make our contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do, however, sound a note of caution about the enthusiasm with which some people are greeting the idea of program and project aid. I think there are points in favour of moving in the direction of using more of the aid in program or project form. But I think it is easy to underestimate the administrative complexity and cost of negotiating projects and programs. It may well be that by the end of the century some of the aid will still be in the form of budget support. If that happens, I do not think it is something to be concerned about. It may be that negotiating all the projects and all the programs that are required to spend the aid are beyond the capacity of the scarce personnel resources available in Papua New Guinea. They might be beyond even AIDAB's capacity unless the staff of that organisation is built up substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to make is the central importance of building up the education system and creating more small business opportunities. It is tragic to see that there are still only four senior high schools. That number must be doubled very quickly. More attention must be given to technical education, vocational education and tertiary education. Small business, the trades sector and the informal sector must be encouraged. Those are the areas which will allow development to occur in the mass of the population&mdash;not from the top down, which is the way the Australians encouraged during the colonial period. We need more mass development of employment opportunities so that the great bulk of the people can experience the benefits of economic development. </PARA>

I recommend the contents of this report not just to those in this Parliament but to a wider audience. It is a excellent report and I would like to compliment the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for the work they have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there is no more fundamental relationship for Australia than that between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It is a unique and strange relationship. At a time when in Europe countries are coming closer together, perhaps it is time for us to recognise the countries in our region to a greater degree than we have. For that reason, I am delighted that our foreign affairs subcommittee has now taken on board a study of our relations with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever Prime Minister or party in government, for an indefinite period to come Australia's relations with PNG are something that we need to consider and pursue carefully, with an understanding of the particular difficulties of our heritage, and to a far greater degree than in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects of our relationship concern me greatly. Paddy Fagon, a Papua New Guinean from Goroka, was in my office in the last sitting period. He is an aspirant for political office and wants to stand for the Eastern Province at the next PNG elections. I was interested to hear from him and others I spoke to in PNG of the extent to which our relationship is still seen as critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have been amazed at the degree to which Papua New Guinea has preserved the semblance of the Westminster democratic system. Papua New Guinea is a very diverse country. There are four million people there, but they are not one people; they are four million people from many individual tribes and families. There are many languages, and communications are hopeless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in the years since independence, many Australians who played such an important role in the colonial days have largely withdrawn. Yet the PNG people look to us to continue. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) commented about a matter I put very high on my list of concerns. That was the point about human contact. We cannot just give money, provide aid and think that is all we need to do. I go along totally with the comments of the honourable member for Fraser in that we cannot just look at maintaining aid in quantity terms, despite the change in its form, and think that will be sufficient; we need to maintain the volume of aid, but we also need to maintain personal involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I think project aid might be a way by which we can take unto ourselves particular projects over a period of time. One of those projects in which I would like to see greater private sector involvement is in the education field. I felt very sad to see in some of the schools we visited the extent to which people are being trained according to our lights and under an educational system which I do not think really relates to the fundamental problems of PNG, rather than being trained to become better villagers or better participants in the PNG economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to help people to acquire the skills necessary to make a success in their own villages. We need to ensure that in technical training there is an opportunity for people to be able to go back to the villages and then contribute from those villages to the national economy. When we are looking at the law and order problem, the difficulty is to provide jobs, to provide education for jobs and to look at the roots of the problem and not just at the training of police, prison officers and so on. In our aid program, we need to place greater emphasis on education. I think some schools in Australia, particularly in the private sector and in the religious sector, could do well to look at opportunities by which they might be able to cooperate in education with some of the schools in Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to say a little bit about defence. I am greatly concerned about the direction the PNG Defence Force is taking. I think that integration with the police force is the wrong direction. I understand the shortage of resources, but there needs to be within the Defence Force an understanding that the criteria used for those who are trained for defence purposes are different from those required for maintaining civil order. I trust that in the development of contacts in the aid program and elsewhere by the Australian Government we keep in mind the essential difference between police responsibilities and domestic law and order and the responsibilities of a Defence Force, which, of course, relate primarily to external defence and, to some degree, to other sorts of terrorist activities within the nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the third report tabled by this Committee this year. It deals with the major avenues for reform of the current training system in Australia. These include post-compulsory education and training, integrated entry level training, employer subsidies, competency based training, participation targets and the expansion of the training market. The Committee's findings and recommendations, if adopted by the Government, will steer this country towards a greatly improved training system for skills development in Australia as we approach the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a vast amount of interest in the area of skills training since the Committee's inquiry commenced in June 1990. A number of reports have been produced reiterating the need for haste in reforming skills training in this country. Skills training is a crucial element of Australia's economic future. Widespread reform of Australia's education and training system is required if Australia is to be internally prosperous and internationally competitive. Industry needs to improve its productivity and quality and therefore there is a greater need for more skilled workers in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of technological change in industry has also brought about the need to develop better work and management practices. This also means training must be appropriate, flexible, accessible and of high quality. Industry is still reliant on a training system that was developed last century. The Committee is disturbed that the process of reform is so slow. It is essential that vested interests which are impeding progress be put aside in the interests of achieving outcomes required to see Australia survive into the twenty-first century. The report seeks to accelerate improvements to the training system in Australia so that worker skills are competitive and advanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for the inquiry was the apprenticeship and traineeship system. There have been many criticisms of Australia's current trade training system. The first one is the apprenticeship system. This is based on a master-slave relationship which is much more cognisant of the needs of a very different era as society moves towards the industrial revolution, not of a society moving towards the technological twenty-first century. It is the reliance on this system that is hampering Australia's development. We also found that such an apprenticeship and traineeship system does not adequately meet the needs of the majority of young Australians. In terms of a gender breakdown of the apprenticeship system, only 10 per cent of apprentices in this country are females and they represent 52 per cent of the population. So on any basis whatsoever apprenticeships are seen as denying young Australians the kind of training that is necessary for them to proceed to the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposals for an integrated entry level training system combining apprenticeships and traineeships will go some way towards solving the inadequacies. This must be combined with an extension of training provision across a broader range of occupations and industries which employ young people. Historically, Australia's post-compulsory education system saw the majority of young people leaving school following the completion of year 10 and a smaller proportion of people continuing to years 11 and 12. This pattern has changed in recent years with the increase in retention rates, which have risen from 34.5 per cent in 1980 to 60 per cent in the last decade. In the Australian Capital Territory school retention rates are close to 95 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The needs and aspirations of our young people must be met and it is up to the school system to respond to the changing needs of our students and to offer courses which do not assume that all students will continue to university. It is blatantly silly when we see that universities provide for 25 to 30 per cent of our young people, yet schools offer courses as if 100 per cent of our students are moving into the tertiary sector. That is a nonsense. The traditional forms of senior secondary schools have to change. We would argue that many changes are needed in the post-compulsory sector. During our inquiry we saw a number of excellent secondary colleges which provide a range of courses and have links with TAFE colleges, universities and the local industry. They provide for a whole range of people&mdash;not just for young people but for other people hoping to return to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great shames of Australia is its involvement in vocational training, which can be described only as dismal. In terms of the percentage of compulsory students in vocational programs, Australia rates second last compared with other OECD countries. Only Greece has a smaller number of students involved in vocational training. The Committee believes that the lack of commitment in this area should be of concern to all Australians. If we are to do anything about skills training in Australia this situation must be tackled head on and addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia to achieve the skill levels required, the  belief in the community that vocational training is somehow inferior to universities and other educational institutions must change. The Committee has no doubt that the prejudices relating to the different status of the various occupations continue to be reinforced in schools. The effectiveness of any entry level training system depends on young people being aware of, and fully understanding, the various options available. It is essential that proper careers education be available in schools to assist students to make informed decisions about their education, training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has gone further and has recommended as part of the reform process that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) ensure that teacher release to industry is an integral part of in-service programs. Many people in our schools have known nothing else. They have gone to school and to teachers training colleges and have then gone back to school, offering no world experience wider than their own within the school system. They have very limited experience of industry. That particular point was raised by a whole range of people we met during our inquiry and also at a workshop which we held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also supports the move towards competency based training rather than time based training. However, this has meant that there needs to be a national framework for the recognition of training and credit transfer. The Committee found that it is particularly important for Australia to acknowledge a national system so that where there are national industry requirements the skills of a person trained in Melbourne can be used by the industry in Mount Isa, Dampier or Carrawatha. It is obviously ridiculous that the State boundaries which currently exist are there only for State and education administrations; they are not perceived by industry or other people as being important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great tragedy which the inquiry exposed was the issue of our technical and further education colleges. In the last decade while there has been a growth in the number of students staying on at school and a growth from 15 to 30 per cent of our young people moving into universities, the TAFE system has stayed where it is. One must ask why. It is this failure by this major sector of the training industry that has to be addressed and has to continue to be developed. TAFE is central to vocational training. We have noted that State governments have not been prepared to increase funding to their own TAFE institutions. We would go further and say that we have seen a growth in the university sector as a result of direct Commonwealth funding. If the TAFE system is to expand, we recognise that there is a need for Commonwealth Government funding. There is a need for a whole series of reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee looked at the whole question of a nationally consistent basis; the need for national targets for young people; and, of course, the development of a single integrated entry level training system which will provide enhanced career opportunities not only for our young people but also for the community at large. The Committee also made a whole range of other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee, I thank all those who contributed to our inquiry through either submissions or the Committee's extensive program of public hearings, visits and discussions and the Committee's workshop.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise to support the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), in bringing down the Committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Training for the 21st Century: A Report on Skills Training: Apprenticeships and Traineeships</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has been at this task for some 16 months. It has travelled the whole of Australia from top to bottom and from side to side. We have spoken to industry, we have visited training centres and we have spoken to the training people. We have tried to cover every base imaginable to come to grips with the major problem that we face in education and training. Australia has an appalling record in vocational training, which is absolutely intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade we have doubled retention rates in secondary schools and high schools. We have increased dramatically the number of young people at our universities and what were once called colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology, but we have stayed static in terms of vocational training. While the Committee does not come to any view about placing blame, nonetheless it makes a number of very significant major recommendations for change in order to rectify the difficult situation in which we find ourselves. Perhaps this starts with an attitude that was generated in the public's mind at least in both Victoria and New South Wales. Honourable members will recall that both these States at one time had vocational high schools and there was a two-stream education approach at the school level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those streams sent students on an academic train designed for university, and the other stream was designed to put young people into apprenticeships with structured training at TAFE. We decided that that system was inappropriate, that it offered second-class education to those who went to technical high schools, so in New South Wales in the late 1970s we quit technical high schools. In Victoria in the early 1980s we quit technical high schools. We have replaced them, unfortunately, with nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States a long time ago adopted an attitude that was expressed by industry. Industry wished the schooling system to produce students who were well balanced and had good basic skills in communications, reading and writing, and in maths. The Germans, however, developed a dual-stream approach where a portion of the students went on to the academic stream designed for entry to university, and the majority of German students went to vocational schools, underwent structured vocational training and entered industry as trainees who were paid a training wage. The American system has worked well for Americans and the German system has worked well for the Germans, but we in Australia need something to take the place of the vocational high schools we once had and of the apprenticeship system which, as the honourable member for Ford has told the House today, is no longer appropriate in the world of work in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we need a new approach to the structured entry level training into industry. The Committee was not able to come to a unified view on this topic. Unfortunately it is a complex issue, and because the community is so much involved in deciding whether the system works we feel more study is needed in that area. However, in almost every other area we did bring down major recommendations and we are willing to back them. We talk about apprenticeships and we ask what is wrong with them, and I think the overview of the report covers that reasonably well. The Committee stated in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apprenticeship system has worked well but for a very small proportion of students, and those who are headed towards crafts. They are supported by demarcations in industry set up through our industrial relations system. But the apprenticeship system today excludes very large sections of the potential work force. It serves rigid demarcations within the work force and impedes the need to develop multi-skilled workers. It impedes the necessary retraining of workers and fails to provide the skills that industry needs when it needs them.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian traineeship system introduced during the lifetime of this Government has not been a massive success because it has not been seen by the public to have had a high value either. So the history of education and training in Australia suggests that it is only in recent times that we have accepted the need for education for almost all of our young people and that we require higher and higher qualifications if we are going to be able to compete with the rest of the world in industry and in commerce and if we are going to survive as a nation economically. Honourable members will recall that once upon a time we built a tariff wall to protect ourselves. We hid behind that wall. For that reason, and because we built structured demarcations into our system, we did not need massive amounts of education. But those times have changed. Australia is changing rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our report about the only issue we made no major attempt to address was industrial relations reform, but we did make one statement which I think is significant in indicating the bipartisan nature of this report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the process of reform. It is concerned however that the reform process based on industrial rewards linked with competency standards could lead to a whole new set of rigidities in the labour market. It is essential that the new system is flexible enough to respond to industry and individual enterprise needs and be adaptable enough to respond quickly to changing requirements in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is significant. I point out that that is a 100 per cent bipartisan report; there were no dissenting views. Over 16 months, all of us came a long way from where we started. We finished up together, and we are as one. This report subsumes an early report of this Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>, which deals with, in major respects, senior secondary colleges and the role that they might play in vocational training. It subsumes the Deveson report on the training costs of award restructuring, which deals with estimates and the need to change the operations of TAFE and charging TAFE fees, and also additional funding to improve the TAFE sector enabling more young people an opportunity to undertake vocational training which they will value. It further subsumes the recent Finn report into post-compulsory education. In that respect, it deals with the need to finance TAFE and to finance training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that we dealt with included, significantly, entry level formal training, but unfortunately we have not been able to come to a unified view on how to go about implementing this system and we will continue to work towards that end. The Committee is of the view that we must establish a training wage. The report details mechanisms that we believe will be appropriate. The training wage is basically a training allowance so that those who are in training are paid according to their level of competence, not according to their age or the length of time they have been in a training capacity. That wage would be substantially less than the wage of a full time employee in that sort of a job. We said that there has been information about the training wage out in the marketplace for two years. Everyone sits on it and no-one does anything about it. The Committee would urge the Government and the education institutions to get on with it, and urge the unions to join them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We discuss the links between schools, TAFE, universities and industry, and those links are becoming daily more critical. We discuss credit transfer between all four. We make recommendations about funding of vocational education. That is significant in that we recommend that the Commonwealth take over from the States the responsibility for funding TAFE because the States have made a poor fist of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the presentation of a bipartisan report from the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and these reports from the Joint Public Accounts Committee, I think it was entirely uncalled for and beyond precedent that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) should call a quorum when reports were being tabled in this House today. I think it would be judged by both sides of the House to be poor form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's 313th report, the report on the control of visitor entry, is the second and final report on the Committee's inquiry into the business migration program and control of visitor entry. The need for two reports arose after the inquiry commenced in June 1990. In the initial response to the inquiry so much concern was expressed about the operation of the business migration program that the Committee decided it would examine that program before looking at matters relating to the control of visitor entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee presented its report on the business migration program to Parliament in June of this year and then began its examination of this matter. This inquiry arose from criticisms made by the Auditor-General of visa issue and entry operations administered in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The Auditor-General found control weaknesses, procedural breakdowns and systems deficiencies which created a serious inherent risk that entry could be granted to people contrary to the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this inquiry, the Committee received 57 submissions and held three public hearings. It also conducted inspections at the entry control point, the international terminal at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, and at the entry operations centre in Canberra. The Committee was aware that the administration of the entry of visitors to Australia is fraught with difficulties. The importance of tourism to the economy and the legitimate expectation of all Australians that family and friends from overseas should be able to enter the country easily as visitors are important considerations. They must be balanced against the need to prevent the entry of undesirable persons such as terrorists and criminals and of those who seek to jump the queue to enter and remain in Australia, albeit illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of visitors to Australia has been steadily increasing. Since 1984-85 there has been an average increase of 20 per cent in the number of visitors and temporary entry visas issued each year. In 1990-91 alone, more than 1.48 million visas were issued. DILGEA has developed a range of databases which allow it not only to control entry but also to have accurate knowledge of who is in the country and whether that person is a legal or an illegal entrant. In 1990-91 over 9,000 illegal entrants were located. Of these, over 4,000 had their departures enforced and over 700 were deported. In April 1991 it was estimated that there were 78,000 illegal entrants in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the number of overstayers is small against the overall number of visas issued, it is a matter of concern to the Committee that some of these people, both students and people from other groups, are involved in serious crime in Australia. The Committee believes that appropriate means have been and are being taken to reduce the number of people who are overstaying their visa period. It notes that additional resources have been provided in the 1991-92 Budget and has recommended that these resource levels be maintained in real terms to reduce even further the number of overstayers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is aware that there are legitimate reasons why a person who holds an Australian passport may wish to travel on another passport. However, the Committee believes that Australian citizens should always use their Australian passports when entering or leaving Australia. Therefore, the Committee has recommended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958. The Committee believes it should be an offence under the Act for Australian citizens not to use their Australian passports when entering or leaving the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given to the Committee highlighted problems which arise when, after the forfeiture of an Australian passport, holders of dual passports can still leave the country. The capacity exists within DILGEA's databases for information to be stored and retrieved on holders of more than one passport. The Committee considers this information could be used more efficiently than it is at present. The Committee has recommended that the databases maintained by DILGEA and the Australian Customs Service be searched for dual passport holdings and that an emergency alert be placed on these databases to prevent the departure from Australia of the holder of a surrendered Australian passport leaving on any other passport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australian citizens apply for Australian passports, they must provide details of citizenship of any other country. The Committee suggests that, before passports are issued, databases maintained by DILGEA and the Australian Customs Service be searched for information on whether applicants hold additional passports. While the number of persons entering Australia temporarily and committing serious crimes is small against total numbers of visas issued, the Committee noted that it was not possible to establish actual numbers or the categories by which such persons gained entry. Accordingly, we have recommended the establishment of a working party to establish procedures to measure the extent of this criminal activity. This working party should examine policing problems, the type of criminal activities undertaken, any geographical concentrations and multi-agency action which should be taken to deal with these activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immigration records and information system, or IRIS, is a database which creates a record of the application for a visa, checks the application against alert lists and prints a visa. IRIS has been established in two phases, and the first version has now been installed in 48 posts overseas, which issue 95 per cent of visitors visas. It is expected to be introduced in all posts by the end of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide an effective immigration screen, the Public Accounts Committee believes the remaining high and low volume posts should be equipped with IRIS as a matter of priority. The Committee has recommended that IRIS be installed in all overseas posts as soon as possible. We believe that the efficiency of the migrant alert list would be improved by the establishment of a two-way communication link with overseas posts and have recommended that such a link be established as soon as possible. Passenger cards are completed by persons entering or leaving Australia and the information provided is used by a number of authorities. After considering this issue, we believe these cards serve a useful purpose and have recommended that they be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pre-visa assessment is a means of screening applicants for student visas from countries which pose a high risk of visa overstay. The introduction of this assessment has had a major impact in controlling student entry because it acts as a bona fide test and includes an assessment of financial viability. The Committee believes that pre-visa assessment of applicants for student entry should continue and that a test of financial viability should be one of the criteria for that assessment. We believe it is particularly important that such assessments of students enrolling in a non-formal course be rigorously maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that the pre-visa assessment is currently under review by a working party made up of DILGEA, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have recommended that this working party review pre-visa assessment for short, non-formal studies, including the retention of prepayment of fees and the introduction of bonds or bank guarantees as a financial viability test in that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our final recommendation deals with the possible use of asylum provisions in the Migration Act by persons holding student visas. Statistics on asylum seekers are compiled against the applicant's country of origin, but there is no record of the category of entry by which an applicant entered Australia. The Committee has recommended that statistics on asylum seekers include an analysis of the categories under which they gained entry to Australia. The Committee acknowledges that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has been working towards an effective system to control visitor entry. We believe our recommendations will make that system work more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commending the report to the House, I take the opportunity to thank all members of the Public Accounts Committee for their efforts, particularly those on the sectional committee for this report, and the staff who have worked so diligently on this issue. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Control of Visitor Entry</EMPHASIS> by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, I would at the outset welcome the adoption on 17 December by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) of the whole of the Committee's earlier, complementary report on business migration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member who pushed most vigorously for this inquiry, I am pleased to see that the Minister, having already put into effect the Committee's recommendation to abolish the discredited former business migration program, has established, again as recommended, specific criteria for the new independent business skills category. These criteria properly include a points test which will assess potential business migrants according to the size of the turnover of their business, facility in the English language and possession of capital for transfer to Australia. Similarly, our report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Control of Visitor Entry</EMPHASIS> should lead to improvements in the management of immigration policy and establish a more secure situation at our borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several important recommendations are made in the report and I would particularly draw the attention of the House to the recommendation that the Migration Act 1958 be amended to require persons who hold Australian passports to use them when entering or leaving Australia. Apart from the obvious law enforcement advantages of this recommendation, it should be a matter of national pride for Australian citizens to use their passport when entering or leaving their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the Committee recommends that a working party of DILGEA and Federal and State police representatives be established to measure the extent of criminal activity of persons entering Australia on visitor and temporary entry visas, and that is vital. Although the proportion of visitors entering Australia engaging in criminal activity is low, the actual activity engaged in is a serious problem, as the Chairman, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), correctly alluded to a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee looks forward to the Minister acting expeditiously on these and our other recommendations, just as he has done with our report on business migration. It has again been a pleasure to work with the Committee and the Chairman.

<PARA>At the outset, I recognise the interest and support of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in my efforts to have this matter considered. I also express my thanks to Mr Speaker and the President, who have indicated that they will assist us in this particular project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask: why a national wool day? We should start by considering the many `days' we have already. I am reminded of people walking around the streets wearing little red noses. I am reminded of their putting such items on the front of their motor cars, trucks and buses. Australians have a lot of `days', most of them being for very good reason and many being in support of charities and other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also reminded, however, of my time at primary school where we had a history book which, as I recollect, was published by a Professor Porteus. I have never forgotten a drawing in that book which showed the map of Australia and immediately under the Great Australian Bight a sheep that apparently was grazing. Of course, the caption was `Australia lives on the sheep's back'. In my youth, that was something I believe all Australians considered to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many changes in Australia since I went to school. But after consulting the relevant statistics, I found that in the last 25 years&mdash;quite recent history&mdash;wool has been our major export commodity in eight of those 25 years; our second major export commodity, after coal, in seven of those 25 years; our third major export commodity, after coal and wheat and other agricultural products, on seven occasions, and after coal and iron ore, on one occasion; and our fourth major export commodity, after coal, wheat and iron ore, on two occasions. In other words, in the last 25 years, wool as an export commodity has never been further back than fourth and, in fact, that was on only two occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool has been a major source of income for Australia. In 1988-89, it produced income of $5.5 billion; in 1989-90, it produced $4.1 billion. Of course, the great concern we have today is that, for 1991, that figure is predicted to fall to $2.8 billion. But that is still a substantial amount of money coming into Australia at a time when we desperately need it. Average sheep numbers around Australia run at about 150 million. It varies substantially, sometimes up in the 170 millions and sometimes down in the 130 millions; nevertheless we have a major sheep population. That sheep population creates substantial employment. The harvesting of wool is quite labour intensive and, of course, the shearing industry has been a great traditional base for the Australian Labor Party. It is part of Australian history that the shearing industry really set the trade union movement in place, and I do not think that a lot has changed in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very interesting aspect of trade unionism that shearers are probably still as fiercely independent as ever, notwithstanding their ability to organise, and of course the shearer himself is still a pieceworker. Nevertheless, shearers do represent a substantial part of the history of the Labor movement in Australia. That just brings to our attention another reason why this proposal should be a bipartisan one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would reiterate that I am very grateful to the honourable member for Stirling for coming to me after I had made some earlier remarks. I am sure his initiatives at this stage equal my own, and I am extremely grateful for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some tremendous reasons for promoting a national day for a product&mdash;at the moment under great pressure in economic terms&mdash;that has delivered to Australia a huge amount of prosperity. As I have already pointed out, it has been our major export commodity for eight of the last 25 years. With this motion I hope that we can put a focus on wool at the commencement of the winter retail season, so that Australians go back to their local product and use it wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On previous occasions I have stood in this chamber and drawn the Parliament's attention to some of the products manufactured from wool that are now available but which most Australians do not know exist. A CSIRO invention has given us a wool doona&mdash;or a wool quilt, as the CSIRO calls it. It is a magnificent product that I have used this year. Australia should be promoting this product around the world, remembering that some eight to 10 million doonas are sold to Japan alone each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An aspect of this motion is to have a function in the Members' Hall aimed at inviting people from the embassies and others, particularly their trade commissioners. I am sure we will take time to take them out to the Great Hall and show them some of these new and innovative products and do as much marketing as we, as members of parliament, can competently do. I hope that all honourable members are in the Members' Hall and in the Great Hall on that day giving support to and pushing wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful that our call will be understood in many areas of Australia. I would like to think that particularly country local government would have excellent entertainment  on that occasion to recognise wool. I am not suggesting that we go to massive expense; I am suggesting that this Parliament, by giving one day's recognition to wool, focus public attention on the product at a time when retailers and others are bringing out their winter fashions. I am hopeful that retailers will consequently also recognise this call. Of course, our committee will be corresponding with them suggesting that on that day there be major launches throughout Australia of wool products in the retail sector and that manufacturers be put on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the media and others that there is a great opportunity for financial reward. All the people involved in various manufacturing industries that benefit by supplying products to wool growers and those that manufacture wool into end-user products would be willing to advertise on that day. Maybe our national print media will go to supplements for a national wool day. Hopefully our television people will take the opportunity to have some entertainment and push wool, and do it at a profit. We all recognise that they should have that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be a big day. I am sure, with the bipartisan support that we have, that will happen. Just the other day I read that a person can now insulate his or her house with wool batts. They do not burn and do not have the problems that many others do. They are not carcinogenic or anything of that nature. All the opportunities are there. This could be the day when the Australian Parliament says, `Come and have a look at wool. We support wool. We support the wool industry'. I am sure we will all get together. There will not be one word of disagreement in the Parliament in promoting wool on that day.

Our colleagues will recognise that this is a great opportunity. It is true that the reaction from the contacts we have had is that it is a good idea. I am pleased to support this motion. I thank the Speaker and the President for their support of this day. They gave approval that this day on 2 April could go ahead. It gives us in this Parliament an opportunity to go ahead with the organisation of this big day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor has identified some of the people who can assist in helping promote the wool industry on this day. We can look at a range of those. The retailers and the Australian Wool Corporation will be important. So, of course, will people connected with shearing. I would be pleased if shearers were to be present and take this opportunity to play a role. Wool classers and a number of others could be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor was quite right. We looked at a paper at the ABARE Agricultural Outlook Conference this year given by a gentleman from Coles-Myer. He spoke about the opportunities for new products. He talked about products such as those that the honourable member for O'Connor has referred to. The use of wool doonas is one. Insulation is another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a child, if someone's woollen jumper somehow got mixed up in the wash and went into the washing machine, it went from a size 16 to a size 12. That is now history; that does not happen to wool. Because of the work of the CSIRO and others in the industry, wool is much more universally used and much more valuable in our community. I use the word `valuable' deliberately. We need to see more value-adding in our wool production. People should use this day as a chance to ask what else they can do to value-add to this very important product. As the honourable member for O'Connor has said, when one looks at the fact that 70 per cent of the world's apparel wool comes from Australia, one realises what a significant role Australia plays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the industry were to reflect on the matter, it would realise that in some senses it priced itself out of the market. There is no doubt that wool, as a fine quality product, is unique; there is no other product that can substitute as well. It was when one moved down the price range that wool began to lose its leverage in the market. Certainly, men can have a wardrobe of two or three suits and that will do. But for women, who often want a wider range of garments, it was often a very expensive commitment to buy woollen garments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this day we want to get the retailers in here and get them to display to us good value woollen products&mdash;because they are available. But the Australian people have lost sight of the fact that there are available many good value products made from Australian wool. We want to see more of those made and manufactured in Australia; not exported and re-imported as a final product. We want to see value-adding in production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying to the Parliament is that here is an opportunity for us as a community in the Parliament to get behind a national wool day. The honourable member for O'Connor has referred to people coming in here, for example, from the trade commissioner area, and having a display in the Great Hall. Honourable members will understand that the intention would be for all of us to wear a woollen garment on that day. I am sure that, if we speak to our colleagues in the Parliament, they will all ensure that on that day in the Parliament they wear a woollen garment made from Australian wool.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Chair. In the paper presented to the Outlook Conference, the gentleman from Myer, Mr Mike Howell, did say some very significant things. I thank him for what was a very good paper in which he talked of examples of how we can reinforce the role of wool. He talked about Superwash in the United States. He mentioned how retail customers through the Marks and Spencer store came to realise that, with Superwash, wool could be treated like any other fabric and that, therefore, it was universally useable. I refer also to the wool mark, which has become a standard. We must congratulate the industry on achieving that standard. It has now been very clearly fixed in people's minds that wool is a quality product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howell also went on to point out that fabric blends and clever marketing could realign wool to the middle market and improve consumption dramatically. I think that that is one of the areas on which we have to focus. We want to see people going in and buying at this middle range. That is the area in which we need to have wool used more and more. In fact, I heard the honourable member in a radio interview in Canberra talking about the increase in the consumption of wool that would occur if we all wore woollen socks, et cetera. It is interesting to see the significant amount of wool that would be taken off the market if we insisted&mdash;or, I should say, encouraged, people to wear Australian made wool products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it meets all the tests. It would meet the test of being a cool wool. By that I mean that it is a product that is not too heavy to wear in an Australian summer. It is important that we be able to say to the community that wool is one of those products that can be used across a wide range of applications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in summing up, I am very pleased to second the motion moved by the honourable member for O'Connor. I think it is a great initiative. I thank him for taking that initiative. I want to support him straight out. We need to say that our proposed national wool day on 2 April next year will be a very significant day. We would like to think that members of parliament would get involved. We would like the wool industry, in all its phases&mdash;woollen mills, retailers, workers&mdash;to be involved. Certainly, we would like the fashion industry to display its new fashions on that day, because we will be between seasons and it would perhaps be appropriate to display winter fashions on that day. I would like to think that we could use this great parliament of ours for such a purpose. I am very pleased to endorse the motion. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a future date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this subject. Coming from the driest State in the driest country of the world, I know that water, particularly River Murray water, is of paramount importance to us. Of course, a lot of work is being done on the River Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of years ago I had a lot of input in respect of the dreaded disease, amoebic meningitis, which was located in Murray water that was pumped to my area in the northern part of South Australia. Unfortunately, a couple of deaths occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australians in general are highly conscious that their State is the driest State in the nation as measured by total run-off and ground water resources. Given that the Murray is the State's only major river&mdash;South Australia lacks a Hawkesbury, a Clarence, a Goulburn or a Shoalhaven river&mdash;South Australians have been most alarmed by the algae disaster in the Darling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Darling and its tributaries do not offer the same water flows as the Murray, South Australia has depended on the Darling in the past at least to partly dilute the Murray's salinity. The Darling also has the effect of increasing turbidity of water flowing to South Australia, which discourages algae. In the past, development of new irrigation along the Darling has been severely questioned in South Australia. Those concerns now appear to have been fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the outbreak of toxic algae has been frightening enough to people living along the affected stretches of river, expert commentators are saying that the algae are still only a symptom of poor water management which may lead to further disasters. In the past, outbreaks of algae have been reasonably common in farm dams, warm still lakes, et cetera, but huge blooms stretching over hundreds of kilometres of a large Australian river have to be regarded as a major warning. The algae are brought on by human actions, namely, sewage and fertiliser run-off in estimated equal quantities plus the impounding of surplus river flows by cotton and other irrigators in the Darling Basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expert view is that sewage inflows from major inland towns in the Darling Basin&mdash;towns such as Tamworth, Orange, Dubbo and Toowoomba&mdash;are critical to the nutrient levels and thus to algae growth. Wide-ranging catchment management changes are also essential. Clearly, provision of funds and advice here is of national, not just local, significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While nutrients in the Murray-Darling are presently being highlighted because of the outbreak of algae, the main pollutant is still salt. Salinity is estimated to cost Australia about $60m a year in lost production, $43m of this being incurred in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys alone. More than 1.3 millions tonnes of salt flush into the Murray each year and this may double in 20 years in the absence of major remedial action. Meanwhile, the economic loss would amount to approximately $95m a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia has been highly conscious of the salinity problem for some time and has frequently urged more concern from New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth. Adelaide depends on the Murray for between 40 and 90 per cent of its water. Murray water is widely distributed to country areas of South Australia, including my areas of Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the positive side, the relatively young Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, together with the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, is making great strides towards better basin management. Once dismissed into the too hard basket, interstate cooperation on the basin is blossoming with the realisation that the Murray-Darling Basin's problems could be terminal. Already, much has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A crucial move by the Council has been to initiate the drawing up of a natural resources management strategy and a salinity and drainage strategy for the basin. The four involved governments are likely to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over 30 years in salinity abatement programs alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of water resources generally, one can list some consequences of living in a dry continent, few of which are fully appreciated in the eastern States. Droughts are part of the Australian climate and must be integrated into water policies. Political and public interest in water needs to be more constant. There is a danger that public concern will flush away with the algae!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many uses for water. Its cost should reflect not only the capital needed to store and distribute it but also its scarcity and the opportunity cost. The Murray-Darling water is needed for drinking water, irrigation, fishing and other recreation, forest and wildlife preservation, flushing of sewage and other nutrients, and so on. Major users, such as cotton and rice growers, cannot be allowed to take unsustainable allotments from what is a very small river system in terms of run-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would expect a dry country to invest heavily in water research. For example, the water requirements of economic and ornamental plants are of vital concern. The 1991-92 Federal Budget increased funding to the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation by more than $2m, to $10.8m. CSIRO has a strong interest in water research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would expect water to be charged on a user-pays basis&mdash;that is, fee per volume&mdash;rather than as a paid service tacked on to a rate bill. Full changeover to this method of payment is unlikely to be popular at first but there is no better way to put over the conservation message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the unreliable rain and high evaporation rates so typical of Australia, there should be a high incidence of rainwater tanks in cities. Their relative scarcity is a reflection of generous but short-sighted water allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our rivers having limited flushing capacity and given the extent of ancient ocean beds in Australia, problems with salinity are inevitable. A total of $6.4m is set aside from the 1991-92 Federal water resources assistance program for salinity control and drainage in the Murray-Darling Basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for cooperation among States. The Murray-Darling Basin incorporates fully 15 per cent of Queensland, yet that State is not a participant in the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to appreciate the natural functions of river flushes or `surplus' water. There is at present little control over private diversion of surplus flows in some rivers. Also, there should be maximum encouragement of flexibility in the use of water rights&mdash;for example, trading. Pollution levels have to be considered in the determination of `credits'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the consequences of poor water management in a dry continent are severe. Already, more than half of the irrigation area of the Murray-Darling Basin is under threat from salinity, so lost production is an early casualty. Secondly, without good management and cooperation, there is inequity and discord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sound water use is everybody's business. The 1983 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water 2000</EMPHASIS> estimated that Australian irrigators were not as efficient in their use of water as their counterparts overseas. Much of the urban water supply was considered to be wasted as a result of gardening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, without correction, Australia's drinking water supplies will continue to deteriorate. Sydney and Melbourne water no longer has a reputation for purity, while country supplies are often grossly contaminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, poor management threatens our way of life culturally and imperils our environmental stage. The Murray-Darling and other grand Australian rivers are not to be regarded merely as water canals upstream and effluent ditches downstream of wherever a person, a farm or a town happens to be or stand. They must be allowed to serve a rich number of functions in harmony. Above all, we must learn that water is precious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, coming from South Australia, which is the driest State in the driest continent, I know that water has a very significant role to play in South Australia's expansion and economic way of life. I urge all honourable members to do more to project water, particularly water from the River Murray, as a major component of this country and this economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for this great nation which has suffered so badly at the hands of this inept Government. This recession, which is clearly the worst in 60 years, has inflicted much pain and suffering on Australia and Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this week the ranks of the unemployed swelled to their largest since the Great Depression. The Australian Bureau of Statistics recorded more than 900,000 Australians as unemployed, an unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent. The number of Australians in jobs in November dropped by another 36,200. The number in full time employment in this country plunged disastrously by 90,400. Significantly, teenage unemployment has now reached a record 31 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to these latest figures was that they were `not unexpected'. When he was interviewed and confronted with the disastrous news about the 10.5 per cent unemployment rate, he said that they were `in line with Budget forecasts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have since heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;and I imagine he is a very temporary Treasurer indeed&mdash;concede that the Budget forecast that unemployment would peak at 10.75 per cent is now looking optimistic. In fact, the Treasurer admitted that what we have been saying for some time is becoming a possibility, that is, that before Australia comes out of this recession, unemployment will in fact go higher than 11 per cent. It seems to me extremely ironic that the Treasury boffins who are desperately seeking to find minor holes in the Opposition's Fightback package are now faced with the reality that their Budget estimates of just four months ago are, in fact, deeply flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The news on unemployment, of course, becomes increasingly gloomy. An estimated 20,000 jobs will be lost in the Australian banking industry in the next year. The ANZ Banking Group Ltd announced only yesterday that it intended to reduce its staff in Australia by some 2,500 during 1992. Last week, the AMP Society announced its plans to shed 550 jobs. Almost every day manufacturers close down or go bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will, indeed, be a very depressing Christmas for those Australians who are unemployed and for the families of those who have been affected. The great irony is that until today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put his job ahead of the nearly one million Australians who are out of work. Today he has apparently decided to do the right thing and resign; and so he should. He is to blame for the miserable Christmas that is faced now by many Australian families. It is his Government's policies and those of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is to be a candidate for the prime ministership tonight, that have inflicted this pain and suffering on Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What hope will there be even under a Prime Minister Keating? As Alan Wood wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the other day, `Forget about the jockey; what about the horse?' He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recovery is hardly being helped by all the activity in the jockeys' changing room.</PARA>
<PARA>What frenetic activity there is in the changing room today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Blaxland becomes Prime Minister, perhaps he will adopt the policy prescriptions of the Opposition in its Fightback package. I wonder whether he will be able to resist the temptation to panic and take the easy options. I wonder what deals are being done in the rooms and hallways of this place today to secure his election. No doubt his friend Bernie Fraser can be relied upon to chop a couple of percentage points off interest rates, but that is not the answer. There are no easy solutions to Australia's problems. I believe that Mr Keating knows this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's legacy to the children of Australia is, of course, a massive debt. Our net debt in 1979-80 was only $6.9 billion; today it is close to $140 billion. Interest payments on this debt increased to more than $14 billion in 1991; in fact, 23 per cent of the value of exports of goods and services is required just to meet that enormous interest debt. The net result of that debt, which was created by the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister to be, is that we have to keep borrowing just to keep pace; otherwise we will have to sell off the farm. Of course, the Government has been rushing headlong into doing that as much as it can as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has mortgaged the future of the children of this country. Today that future is very much at risk as we see the spectre of our credit rating being further downgraded. Our living standards, which have fallen consistently and disastrously under this Government, will continue to fall. I say with great regret that we are a nation in debt and a nation out of work. Yet the Government's attention is focused&mdash;and we see so much evidence of this in this place today, with the Parliament a complete fiasco and out of control&mdash;on its own problems rather than on the country's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and, in particular, the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, caused the recession. Now they are paralysed and cannot find a way out of it. They are unable to deliver the reforms that Australia needs. It has fallen to the Opposition to produce a blueprint for reform. We have taken the initiative; we have the vision; we have the policies. Rather than respond in kind, the Government has resorted to pathetic scaremongering. Its attempts to discredit our Fightback package have failed dismally. It has been unable to find fault with the arithmetic; it has been unable to find fault with the economics. The Government is hopelessly inadequate and cannot provide alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read today the following statement of P. P. McGuinness about the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that remains to be seen is how much damage it does in its death throes.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government is to be condemned on every front. Not only has it created the worst level of unemployment since the Great Depression; it has also, as I said, saddled Australia with a great debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the enormous number of almost one million Australians out of work. The great shame is that many of these unemployed are young Australians. The youth unemployment rate across the country is running in excess of 30 per cent. It is a great pity for these young people. Their ranks are soon to be swelled by those leaving school shortly. Early in 1992 we will see an even higher rate of youth unemployment. The great pity is, of course, that kids are unable not only to get jobs, but also to access a tertiary education. We see that the Government has failed miserably in the provision of places at universities for them and we see it has failed dismally in providing places at TAFE colleges for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I grieve for this great nation, a nation that had so much potential and, indeed, still has potential, but a nation that has been failed by this Government, its Prime Minister and the person who pretends to be Prime Minister. At 7 o'clock tonight we may well have him as the leader of this nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) talks about his package being a visionary program for the future of Australia, he is correct. But it is a vision that is founded on New Right ideology. The package appeals to every bigoted, racist and sexist attitude that pervades our community, building upon a mammoth redistribution of income from low and middle income earners to the rich and powerful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberals keep challenging us to look at the package as a whole agenda for change. We should certainly do so. It is an agenda to divide, to punish and to weaken our fundamental principles of social justice and fair play. It appeals to what the Liberals believe is the lowest common denominator in our community&mdash;greed. The basic message to the Australian community is, `We will give you more money by taking it away from someone else who, we believe, does not deserve it'. But it is like a shell game. Just when we think we know where that extra bit of money is, we lift the shell to find it empty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition promises average families big tax cuts and then takes all of that income away from the extra costs of food and essential services through the GST. Ultimately, all of the tax cuts disappear with bracket creep, but the GST stays and continues to eat into people's incomes and living standards. This is clearly demonstrated in the New Zealand experience. Selwyn Parker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 10 December wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After five years of the goods and services tax, the New Zealand experience has overwhelmingly proved one thing: Consumption taxes are good for governments. So far, what can be said definitively about the GST is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* It has dramatically increased the indirect tax take without slowing much the government's haul from direct taxes. In its first year of operation, in 1986-87, the GST pulled in $NZ1.22 billion (about $A870 million). In 1990-91, as more and more taxpayers were drawn into Inland Revenue's net, the take soared to $NZ6 billion after reimbursements. Driven by the GST, the total indirect tax take nearly tripled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the quid pro quo of lower income taxes was supposed to compensate for the introduction of the GST, the tax you can't duck, the government's indirect tax take has continued to increase. Income taxes amounted to $NZ9.1 billion in 1986; in 1990, they were around $14 billion. Put another way, every New Zealander was paying $4800 in total taxes in 1986. By 1991, they were paying more than $8,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Another of Dr Hewson's promises is cheaper fuel, claiming a 19c a litre, or $12 a tank, fall in prices. But he has not explained how he is going to pay for road funding. The most obvious way is by increasing registration fees by $300 to $400 a year per person to pay for roads. Dr Hewson promises full compensation for inflation but fails to compute a whole range of factors into the inflation measurement, understating the inflationary impact by at least 3 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson promises great productivity growth, but when one actually looks at his calculations, one sees that over the next decade his projected growth in economic performance is less than what the Hawke Government has achieved over the last eight years. Hewson targets the unemployed, sole parents, Aborigines, migrants, older women, environmental groups and students, blaming them for all of the problems in our economy, and making them pay for the benefits which will flow to the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's package is one which rejects fairness and equity and looks set to abandon all that this Government has achieved in terms of social justice and the social wage which the Labor Government has delivered to the Australian public over the last nine years. This Government has done a great deal to lower the overall tax burden on the average PAYE taxpayer and reduce the size of the public sector. This appears to have been overlooked by the Liberal Party of Australia in the preparation of its package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party's Fightback package is fundamentally flawed in that it distributes wealth away from the poor back to the rich. The package will see massive tax cuts for those on high incomes, while lower and middle income earners receive much smaller income tax cuts but will also be slugged 15 per cent on all the necessities of life. A person earning $25,000 a year will gain only $22.70 a week in tax cuts, but a person earning $75,000 will get an extra $135.30 a week in tax cuts. For the person who earns $25,000, all this $22.70 extra will be taken in higher prices because of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Merle Mitchell said, the sick, the disabled, sole parents and the unemployed would bear the brunt of the Liberals' Fightback package. Ms Mitchell said that changes proposed by the Liberal Party would force the wives of disabled pensioners to work part time and still provide care, while sole parents with teenage children would be locked out of part time work opportunities. Ms Mitchell states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing waiting periods for benefits would force even more families and individuals to rely on charity and handouts to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's Fightback package proposes that the social security Budget be cut by $2.5 billion. This, combined with the increase in inflation expected under the Opposition's proposals, would see the poor and disadvantaged even worse off. The cuts in personal income tax rates will be brought about not by the introduction of the GST but by slashing government spending, particularly in the area of social security. Professor Geoffrey Brennan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catholic Weekly</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is anything in the Hewson package for taxpayers as a group, it comes about not through the general sales tax or any over side change but through expenditure cuts. And here we need to remind ourselves that when government cuts $100 million from its expenditure, that $100 million in money that someone got from government yesterday that they won't not get tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Brennan states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, however, the effects of the Hewson package on the tax side are swamped by the effects on expenditure side. Everyone tends to be in favour of cuts in other people's favourite expenditure programmes. And we all like to focus on how much less tax we will pay, and whether the tax calculations show us doing better than most others. But when roads deteriorate, hospital services decline, and we start to pay more for things like water and electricity and postage and television, the cost of tax cuts start to become very evident.</PARA>
<PARA>The package that the Liberal Party is proposing is, of course, a divisive policy mix. The Opposition has clearly given with one hand, by giving personal income tax cuts, and taken back with two hands with the introduction of a goods and services tax and major cuts in income support and services. According to Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson has taken a consumption tax nobody wanted and buried inside a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it all sounds too good to be true, it is. The reason Dr Hewson's tables show that everyone wins and no-one loses, is that it takes no account of the things that make the package add up:  gross cuts in government spending worth $10 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since it is not possible to identify whose pockets would be hit by that $10 billion slash, it is ignored in all of Dr Hewson's figuring of who wins and how much.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He has taken . . . tax reform and surrounded it with gimmicks he thinks will appeal to people whose grasp on the topic is shaky:  the abolition of payroll tax, the tax free saving scheme and the first home owners' scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Political pressures have obliged him to pretend that changing our tax system is the key to rebuilding our economy. He is not silly enough to believe that.</PARA>
<PARA>Gittins concludes with this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if you would prefer to vote for tax cuts and gimmicks, the new look Professor is happy to accommodate you.</PARA>
<PARA>The GST package will do little to help those on low and middle incomes. A week after the release of the Fightback package the President of the Taxpayers Association, Eric Risstrom, strongly criticised the package. Risstrom stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Hewson said at the launch that the tax cuts were directed at the low and middle income earners. The figures don't seem to stack up that way.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Liberal's package is a hoax. It may allow for some items to be cheaper and some people to be better off, particularly the rich, but as Hewson admits, if not boasts, this package will lead to a much more divided Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to draw the attention of this House to an act of wilful vandalism that is being perpetrated by the Government in its attempts to wrest control of the John Curtin School of Medical Research from the Australian National University. Despite the wishes of the Australian National University Council, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has made it clear that he intends to press on with transferring the funding of the John Curtin School to the National Health and Medical Research Council and to support arrangements which would effectively remove from the university the capacity to undertake strategic planning involving the John Curtin School.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government bases its stand on the report of the Committee of Review headed by Sir Ninian Stephen. Despite the understandable opposition of the university to the recommendations of the Committee in relation to the John Curtin School, the Government has demonstrated a quite remarkable determination to proceed regardless of any action taken by the university and any response by the university to the issues raised by the Stephen Committee. There has been a conspicuous unwillingness on the part of the Government to enable proper consultations to take place, consultations that would have been entirely appropriate given the magnitude of the changes proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's move is of dubious legality. It is certainly a departure from the spirit of the legislation governing the Australian National University which unambiguously vests in the university control over the John Curtin School. Further, the Government has not come to the Parliament to seek amendment to this legislation; rather, it is attempting to achieve its aims by financial power because it knows that the Parliament will not give it legislative sanction. It has resorted to those tactics we have come to know so well in higher education&mdash;the bully-boy tactics of thuggery and coercion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of little consequence that the Australian National University will retain what amounts to token representation on the board of management. Behind the soothing words of this arrangement lurks the harsh reality. The disbursement of funding will not be controlled by the Australian National University. If the National Health and Medical Research Council does not get its way, it can simply ask the Minister to cut funding to the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a far more draconian arrangement than the modus vivendi reached over the other research schools of the Institute of Advanced Studies in which the Australian Research Council is to consult and seek agreement with the Australian National University on the composition of review panels and the performance criteria to be applied in evaluating each school at five-yearly intervals. The reports of these reviews will form the basis of the Australian Research Council's advice to the Government as to the notional level of funding to be provided to each school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an arrangement with which the ANU felt finally that it could live, its autonomy and integrity remaining intact. But not so with the John Curtin School, which is effectively being wrenched away, by the Government, from the Australian National University's control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the present dispute is a proposed administrative arrangement for funding the school through the NHMRC. Section 20 of the Australian National University Act confers on the Board of the Institute of Advanced Studies responsibility under the Council for all academic matters relating to the Institute. While the academic matters are to be determined by the ANU, the proposal makes clear that this is to be a matter of mere formality and that academic matters will not effectively include research. Hence, the main function of the school, in fact its very raison d'etre, is not to be within the effective purview of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the latest chapter in an insidious process that has seen the inexorable expansion of ministerial discretion intruding into higher education. The concerns aroused by the Government's actions here are not confined to the John Curtin School nor to the Australian National University. The entire academic community is looking on aghast at this unprecedented trampling of university autonomy. It wonders which institution will be next. The John Curtin School of Medical Research is unquestionably a world-class biomedical research institute. Its standing in the international research community has been objectively demonstrated by bibliometric analysis which quantifies the use made in scientific journals of the school's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The school's particular mission has been in nurturing and fostering long term research on a diverse range of problems. It has been accused of being unfashionable because of this. One of these presumed unfashionable areas has been its continuing research&mdash;much of it in a voluntary capacity&mdash;into the physical legacies of that `unfashionable' war in Vietnam and the `unfashionable' ailments suffered by those `unfashionable' ex-servicemen, the Vietnam veterans. No one could have been unmoved last week when a representative of the Vietnam Veterans Association delivered to an Australian National University protest meeting his heartfelt and unsolicited appreciation of the John Curtin School's tireless efforts in treating the victims of agent orange and various cancers, including brain tumours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Government's course of action has unleashed considerable anger, but it is useful at this stage to take a detached look at the criticisms levelled at the John Curtin School. It is clear, though, that significant measures have been set in train to attend to problems identified in both the Stephen Committee report and the decennial review of 1988. Given this, one must question the haste with which the Government is moving on the issue when the problems are already being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms is that the school has become, in the words of one critic, a sheltered workshop of scientific inbreeding. In academic circles, this is usually taken to mean a general sameness in type and origin of degrees, and for favoured students to be appointed to vacancies when their mentors retire. Professor Max Neutze, Director of the Institute of Advanced Studies has convincingly and irrefutably nailed this one. The facts are that the 31 tenured staff at the school obtained their first degrees from 15 different universities, eight of them overseas. Significantly, not one of them earned their first degree at the Australian National University and only nine obtained their higher degree there. The degrees of the 44 non-tenured staff originated in 25 different universities&mdash;15 of them overseas institutions. Only five earned their first degrees at the Australian National University and 18 earned their higher degree there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism has been the vexed issue of tenure. The John Curtin School, along with the other research schools, has been moving towards a smaller ratio of tenured to non-tenured staff to the extent that it is now much lower than in other universities. Professor Neutze makes the point&mdash;and it is a vital one given the school's long term mission&mdash;that a nucleus of tenured staff is essential if academic freedom is to be protected and the best of the researchers are to be free to undertake long and difficult projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been, it seems, envious and covetous eyes cast at the level of funding for the John Curtin School. It has been alleged that the school is featherbedded and that its staff do not compete for funds. The school has been sensitive to this criticism, notwithstanding that there have been ongoing independent reviews of the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that from 1992, next year, the allocation of resources is to be refereed externally by experts both in Australia and overseas, as well as by a Research Advisory Board which has a majority of seven external members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the John Curtin School is forcibly brought under the funding aegis of the NHMRC, there will be one sole source of funding for all Australian medical research. In such a centralised environment, the very real danger is that the John Curtin School's long term mission&mdash;its propensity for so-called `unfashionable' research&mdash;will be destroyed. It is a further example of this Government's distrust of higher education and scientific communities. They have to be somehow controlled and brought to heel, and the means chosen to achieve this is increasing centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world scientific community is looking very hard at what the Government is doing in relation to the Australian National University at present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak in this House today about leadership. It seems to be a relevant topic in the media and elsewhere at the moment. I must say that the media hype, hysteria and sense of fair play on this issue have been pathetic and appalling and, above all, unprofessional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the leadership I want to talk about is that which has not been grabbing national headlines. I am going talk about two great community leaders in north-west Queensland: the late Philip Yanner, who died earlier this month aged only 44 and who will be missed by everyone throughout the Gulf; and Tony McGrady, the State member for Mount Isa and, as of this week, the Minister for Resource Industries in the Goss Labor Government in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Philip Yanner died of a heart attack in Burketown on Saturday, 30 November, he was chairperson of the ATSIC Gulf Regional Council and a member of the Burketown Shire Council and of the Carpentaria Land Council. He was the key negotiator for the Aboriginal communities in the Gulf region in discussions with the mining giant CRA about the Century Mine development near Doomadgee. Most importantly, he was a supportive husband to his wife, Irene, and eight children. Whenever someone was needed on a committee to lobby for Aboriginal interests, Philip would be there. He was the most travelled man in the Gulf. The Century Mine project kept him especially busy playing a coordinating role between the Doomadgee and Mornington Island communities, the State Government and the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Philip's massive contribution to the Gulf communities was recognised at his funeral service attended by over 1,000 people in Burketown on 7 December. People came from Doomadgee, Mornington Island, Cairns, Mount Isa and Townsville. I was privileged to be a pallbearer at the funeral. Everyone spoke of Philip's tireless commitment to his people and to the difficulty of finding a leader of similar stature to step into his shoes. I have no doubt that the void left by Philip will be filled. As his son Jason said at the service, it is important that Philip's work continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is especially important that someone continues the vital job of looking after the interests of the Gulf communities in relation to the Century Mine development. I arranged for the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to visit the Century Mine site as a guest of CRA in September and I am fully supportive of the Minister's intention to fast track the project. CRA has already spent millions of dollars on exploration feasibility studies and I am confident that the mine will be a great boost to the local economy in north-west Queensland and, more importantly, of course, to the Australian economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, fast tracking does not have to be at the expense of appropriate environmental and Aboriginal concerns. Aboriginal interests are not necessarily in conflict with the interest of mining companies, despite the new right banter of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who, in his continuing campaign to polarise the Australian community, announced this week that he would reverse the Coronation Hill decision if he got into power. He has also announced a possible review of the World Heritage boundaries of the wet tropics area of North Queensland. Economic rationalism rules the day for Dr Hewson. He will not be listening to greenies or Aboriginal groups: stuff the environment, the next generation can worry about that, trample over Aboriginal beliefs and interests and make a mockery of our international human rights obligations, of our basic humanity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson can operate only in cliches; in black and white. It is all or nothing; in fact, it is extremes. Our world, however, is complex; it is shades of grey; it is a multitude of competing interests. It does not respond on cue to mathematical formula. For example, as I understand it, the Gulf Aboriginal communities are very supportive of the Century Mine development, although they do have concerns about a proposed slurry pipeline to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Aboriginal communities' concern is echoed by environmental groups and by the fishing industry in the Gulf, who fear the consequences of a spill from the pipeline. I am very keen to the see the mine go ahead. However, I also share the community concern about the pipeline plan. I have made my concerns known to CRA, as has the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that CRA has made an undertaking to the Queensland Government that it will fully examine the option of moving concentrate from the mine site to port by rail through either Mount Isa or Cloncurry, despite the company's current preferred option being the pipeline to the Gulf. I plan to work very closely with the Queensland State Government to ensure that the railway option gets the thumbs up. Recommendations in the report of the Industry Commission on rail transport released in August this year, if implemented by the Queensland Government, could increase the viability of the rail option for CRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major factors influencing CRA's preference for a pipeline to the Gulf over a rail link with, say, Townsville is the initial infrastructure cost coupled with ongoing freight costs. In Queensland mineral royalties are recovered through the Queensland Rail system. At page 276 of its report, the Industry Commission, in relation to Queensland Rail coal pricing policy, concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the collection of `royalties' by means of excess rail charges: has advantaged Queensland relative to other States in the distribution of Commonwealth general revenue grants; hides the true facts about both royalties and freight rates; provides little opportunity for negotiating more efficient ways of running services; enables unprofitable QR services to be cross-subsidised; and undermines the possible economic gains from more efficient ways of collecting coal royalties.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission further recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . super-normal profits, whether described as `royalties' or otherwise, should not be obtained via rail freight rates. In the case of Queensland, this could initially be achieved by identifying, and separating, the royalty component from the freight charge, and requiring that the royalty be paid directly to the Queensland Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA>For very obvious reasons, it is hard to imagine the Queensland Treasury being too enthusiastic about this idea. However, if we are serious about micro-economic reform in the transport industry, then we must ensure that freight is costed on a rational basis. Also for very obvious reasons, the Queensland Mining Council has strongly endorsed the Industry Commission's assessment of the State's rail freight policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is also a role for the Federal Government in terms of speeding up investment and infrastructure. Dr Hewson's free market extremism ignores the critical role that public infrastructure can play in development in this country. The views of a group of nine major managing directors in Australia, including CRA, BHP and CSR, are not half as gung-ho as Dr Hewson about a free for all, sink or swim economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caroline Currie, lecturer in banking and finance at the University of Technology in Sydney, makes the point that the group of nine have called for policies that draw from both sides of the political spectrum. What she is saying is that simple New Right economic rationalism on its own is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe government must work with industry to develop infrastructure to facilitate investment. We should be extending the national rail network, developing ports and building third runways. We should also be working closely with CSIRO to ensure that we develop a manufacturing base to service our mining industry. I intend to work very closely with Queensland's new Minister for Resource Industries, Tony McGrady, to ensure that both the State and Federal governments do everything they can to facilitate the railway option for the Century project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned at the start of this speech, Tony McGrady is one of the great community leaders in the north-west. Tony was sworn in as a Minister in the Goss Labor Government in Queensland only this week. It is as a personal friend and as a parliamentary colleague that I congratulate Tony. Tony has been a leader in the Mount Isa community for many years. He was Mayor of Mount Isa from 1985 until his election to the State seat of Mount Isa in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is an obvious choice for Minister for Resource Industries, having started out working in the smelters of Mount Isa Mines when he was 20 years of age. When Tony resigned from Mount Isa Mines to become Mayor, he was the head of the Public Relations Department at MIM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tony McGrady is a very strong advocate for the interests of country Queenslanders. He is a very persuasive and effective advocate for his seat of Mount Isa. He understands the mining industry. Tony, as Minister for Resource Industries, will now have a pivotal role to play in the CRA Century Mine development. I look forward to a long and fruitful working relationship with Tony, leading hopefully to a railway link from the Century Mine to the Mount Isa-Townsville railway line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today Australia is locked into a crisis of confidence and has been for almost 18 months. The Government has lost confidence, the people of Australia have lost confidence in that Government and the Government itself is racked with crises. We have a double-barrelled effect of economic and political problems which the Government has forced upon the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on one major issue that that lack of confidence has caused in the Australian economy&mdash;unemployment and the effect it is having on our younger and older people who cannot get work. We have reached a national unemployment figure of 10.5 per cent, which is the worst level ever recorded in surveys by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That figure does not include the hidden unemployed: spouses who are not eligible for benefits; students staying at school longer; people on training programs; and those who have simply given up and have stopped looking for employment because they know that employers have no confidence in this Government. The Government has no confidence in itself. Support for the two leadership aspirants is evenly poised and the Government is racked with divisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost one million people stand in the dole queues while the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spends all of his time trying to save his job&mdash;as he has been for the past 18 months&mdash;rather than trying to find policies that will put people back into employment. Those people have been put out of work by the Government's policies. The leadership fight has been going on for at least 18 months, probably longer. Somebody suggested to me that it has been going on since 1988. People within the Government ranks would know better than I would. But the leadership fight has been going on since the so-called Kirribilli deal and the Prime Minister welshed on that deal for the transition process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of confidence in the Australian economy and the major contributor to this is the high level of unemployment. That lack of confidence, of course, has been forced upon us. We have been led into this recession by a Prime Minister who has lost contact with the Australian people, who has lost the true direction of where we should be heading, and the economy has been pushed into recession by the man who said it was the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Country Victoria is suffering in the extreme from the Government's failed policies. In Bendigo, for example, the unemployment rate almost doubled between June 1990 and June 1991, jumping from 6.6 per cent to 12.8 per cent&mdash;those figures are from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In nearby Eaglehawk, it climbed from 7.7 per cent in 1990 to 15.2 per cent in just 12 months. Bet Bet shire, which is a little further out in a rural area, recorded a jobless rate of 25.9 per cent for the 1991 June quarter&mdash;the highest figure in Victoria. Nationally, unemployment has now reached 10.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 6.30 tonight Government members face a difficult choice. They can either stick with the Prime Minister who has led us into this recession or they can move over to the man who has pushed us into the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anticipated that in Victoria the jobless rate will exceed 11 per cent. There have been predictions by sources close to the Government that it will, in fact, exceed 11.5 per cent by June next year. I want to know how much higher that figure will go before the Government turns its attention to the leadership squabble and sorts it out. We have the answer now; the time of reckoning is at 6.30 tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is going to make any difference at all whom the Government chooses to lead it, because we have had two people who have been working in concert for eight years; the man who led and the man who pushed Australia into that recession. There would be a number of honourable members in this House who&mdash;like the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe)&mdash;must be very unsure of their political futures, with unemployment leaping in his electorate from 4.2 per cent in June 1990 to 10.8 per cent in June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we on the coalition side have done is prepare an economic package which will lead Australia out of the mess that it is in. What the Government has chosen to do is talk about destroying the Fightback package. The only comment that we have really heard from the Government is that it is going to destroy the Fightback package. It says nothing about rebuilding this country and creating jobs for the million people who are out of work. It has been talking only in terms of destruction. It says, `We are going to destroy something'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already destroyed the Australian economy. It has got a million people out of work. Is it going to destroy the economy further? Are Government members not going to pick up any of the initiatives which we on the coalition side have spelt out? We have spelt out a total package. The Fightback package is one of the most comprehensive documents ever seen in the Australian community. It is so embracing that it touches on virtually every aspect of Australian life. It holds out hope for people's futures. It provides some reward for effort. Let people get out and work. Provide them with some incentive to get out and work and reward them. Do not penalise them with the terrible taxation system that we have now whereby the harder they work, the higher the tax bracket they move into, and the less take-home pay they receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package is one which will inspire confidence in this nation. Already the support for my leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), has rocketed ahead. People want some guidance and they want some leadership. They want to move into the 1990s with confidence. They have no confidence in this Government at the moment, none at all. A change of leadership will make absolutely no difference, because all it will do is move the leadership from the leader to the one who pushed. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) acted in concert for 18 months, drove this country into recession, forced it deeper into the mire, and took away the confidence of the small businessman from business and the private sector.

The rural members of the community would have no confidence in a government led by the honourable member for Blaxland. They have little confidence in the present Prime Minister. They would have even less confidence in the honourable member for Blaxland, because the people from the rural sector know that his ideology would not be in their best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of manufacturers have closed down in my electorate. There has been a lot of discussion about tariff reductions. I can tell the House that those manufacturing industries did not close down because of tariff reductions. They closed down because of a lack of sales. The retail trading figures in Australia have been down for some 18 months. Month by month retail sales have been dropping. The lack of orders and the lack of sales have been why many of these manufacturers have gone out of business, closed down and retrenched their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no confidence in Australia until an election is held and the Leader of the Opposition takes over as the Prime Minister of this country. Australia wants the Leader of the Opposition to lead it out of this mire. He has presented the Fightback package, which spells out the reforms which need to be carried out in this country. Reward for effort will be our number one objective. People will work hard and be rewarded, not penalised for their efforts in Australia. This is the sort of leadership that Australia is demanding. The Fightback package is being so well received because it gives people hope for the future. There is absolutely no hope under the present Administration, nor will there be, irrespective of who leads the Labor Party. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At midnight on Tuesday, 10 December the New South Wales Government passed legislation overturning the High Court's decision in Latoudis v. Casey (1990) 65 ALJR 151. The High Court decision gave people appearing before the Local Court on charges of criminal offences the same right to obtain costs as citizens in civil proceedings if the charges were dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently in New South Wales and other States the Crown rarely had costs awarded against it when prosecutions failed. Citizens were left not only with the personal trauma of having had to face the courts, but also with the expense of legal representation. Until the High Court intervened, individual citizens had to bear the costs of prosecutorial errors. Mr Justice McHugh described this very aptly. At page 164 of the judgment, he said, `The result is unequal justice'. Now, unequal justice has been reintroduced in New South Wales in midnight legislation by a government that nine hours later lost its majority on the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justices (Costs) Amendment Bill 1991 was passed at midnight on Tuesday, 10 December by the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. The vote in the chamber was 47-all, with one independent, Mr Macdonald Manly, voting with the Government, and the other three, Mr Hatton, Dr Metherell and Ms Moore, voting with the Opposition. The Bill passed because the Speaker cast his vote with the ayes. Nine-and-a-half hours later, the Liberal-National Party coalition lost that majority when Mr Acting Justice Slattery declared The Entrance election result invalid. The Bill was then rushed through the upper House the next day without the usual five days delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government has taken away the citizen's ordinary expectation that, if a prosecution against him in the Local Court fails, the prosecution side should pay his costs. The ancient legal rule that the Crown is immune from paying costs was overturned in the 1970s. The High Court judgments argue powerfully that, on the balance of public interests, the police should pay the costs. At pages 153-54, the Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that police and other public officers charged with the enforcement of the criminal laws will be discouraged by the apprehension of adverse orders for costs from prosecuting cases which should be brought is without substance and is no longer accepted by the courts: see Ex parte Hivis: Hamdorf v Riddle; Puddy v Borg; Barton v Berman. The courts have rightly recognised that the Executive's practice of indemnifying police officers against payment of costs ordered against them undermines the argument which found favour long ago in Ex parte Jones (1906).</PARA>
<PARA>On page 153, the Chief Justice argued powerfully:</PARA>

Those in the Opposition are trying to tell people in the galleries that they should pay 15 per cent more for bread, milk, train fares, food and clothing. What is going to be cheaper?

I might add that recently a report on cement in Australia was released by the Anti-Dumping Authority. Three-and-a-half years ago, members of the Labor Caucus took up the issue of cement being dumped in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether one is talking about tomatoes, citrus, pasta, chocolates, biscuits or the situation with cement, the reality is that dumping has occurred in Australia and the current anti-dumping mechanism is overly bureaucratic and excessively slow. I put the point that, where the landed price in Australia is below the price in the country of origin of that import, then there is a prima facie case of dumping. It should therefore be on the importer to demonstrate that that good has not been dumped in Australia. We need to reform our dumping system because I believe the current system is ineffective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen such reports. Of course, the Opposition's so-called Fightback package is based on the introduction of a goods and services tax. As the honourable member for Capricornia says, it is claimed by the Opposition that it would make all categories of Australian households better off. There is an inherent implausibility about a proposition which says that if we were to cut income tax and some other taxes and introduce a goods and services tax, and then cut expenditure and government outlays by several billion dollars, suddenly every household in Australia would be better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, this would seem to be a rather implausible proposition and, on analysis, it has proved to be exactly that&mdash;a proposition which has no substance in truth. Analysis by the Federal Treasury shows that the great majority of full time wage and salary earner households and self-employed and farm households would be worse off as a result of the Opposition's package.</PARA>

Seven-and-a-half billion dollars is still a lot of expenditure cuts. When Opposition members did the distribution of the impact of their package to households, do you know what they forgot to do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite say it will be returned to the taxpayers, but they use it as part of the means of compensating for the goods and services tax. Tax bracket creep is an increase in tax which comes about because of the impact of inflation. As people's income goes up with inflation, their average tax rate goes up because more of their income is taxed at higher marginal tax rates. That means that return of tax bracket creep is needed to compensate for the increase in tax itself. So when tax bracket creep is returned it is not done as compensation for some other tax; it is done in compensation for the fact that there has been an increase in tax, which is the tax bracket creep itself. But the Opposition gives back the tax bracket creep to many taxpayers&mdash;in fact, the bulk of them&mdash;as part of the compensation for the goods and services tax, another tax entirely. So they are using the one tax cut to pay both for the return of tax bracket creep&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

Rather than providing net benefits to all households, the reality is that, after taking account of those expenditure cuts that can be included in the analysis&mdash;and many of them could not be included in our analysis because it was not statistically possible to do it&mdash;and the tax bracket creep con, we find that over 70 per cent of full time wage and salary earner households are worse off when all the things that can be taken into account in statistical analysis are taken into account, as are over 60 per cent of self-employed and farm households.

The real priorities in this country concern what happens in the labour market, which occupied 1 1/2 pages in the 600-page Fightback package, and what happens in micro-economic reform, which gets a couple of guest mentions in the Fightback package.</PARA>

That was an effort made in the early 1980s; as a result of that the Opposition has produced a 1980s package. If those opposite do not think that will be exposed over the next 15 months, they have another think coming. It will be, and is being, thoroughly exposed.

The public will learn over the next 15 months that this is a gigantic steal from the pockets of ordinary Australians to benefit massively the very wealthy in this country, and they will not take to it.</PARA>

It is important to understand this because it is the fundamental difference between our approach to industry policy and the approach of those opposite. Those opposite seem to think that they are going to get industry going by simply changing the tax mix, rather than by using the leverage of their ability to actually engineer investment. What we did in being prepared to give up the $47m in the coal export duty was to get from BHP-Utah&mdash;those opposite should listen to this because they might learn something&mdash;a commitment to invest $122m in mining activity which will produce 120 jobs, a commitment over five years to an additional $65m for research and development and a commitment to $50m for rehabilitation works.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, which does address an issue of real importance to this country. We would have to say that we have reached the point of make or break in the Uruguay Round. Tomorrow the Director-General of GATT will bring down a package right across the Round on a take it or leave it basis for the international community. I believe that success is within our grasp if the international political will exists to accept that package. There can be no doubt that the international economy desperately needs the kind of boost it would receive from a successful Uruguay Round package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have pursued Australia's interests in the Round vigorously through the Cairns Group and bilaterally. Last week we had a very useful Cairns Group meeting in Geneva. The Group revealed both its unity and its determination to achieve a truly liberalising outcome to the Round. That commitment remains undiminished. I quote from the communique, which stated that the Cairns Group `renewed their resolve that the Round could not and would not conclude, in whole or in part, without a substantial outcome on agriculture'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Group indicated the essential elements required for a successful outcome to the agricultural side of the Round. I will go through the major points. It was stated that we must have a full reinstrumentation and reduction of border protection and assured increases in the current market access that agricultural trading countries have. It was stated that we reject any notion that these cuts in border protection should be balanced by increased protection in other agricultural areas&mdash;the so-called notion of `rebalancing'. It was further stated that we are urging substantial reductions in export subsidies. We believe that at least part of that reduction must be done in volume terms to be truly effective and that there must be an immediate commitment that export subsidies will not be used on new products or in new markets. Finally, of course, we want to see effective disciplines on all internal payments linked to production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I relayed that message from the Cairns Group to the Director-General. The Cairns Group also asked me to stay involved in the negotiations in Europe during the week, so I had subsequent meetings with key British officials and with Dutch Prime Minister Lubbers and Trade Minister Van Rooy, who are critical because at the moment they occupy the presidency of the European Community. In all, I had a series of three major meetings with the Director-General of the GATT. He indicated quite clearly that he intends to bring down a package of measures across all aspects of the Uruguay Round on Friday, Geneva time. I believe that that package, with all the compromises that it involves, will still respond very clearly to the needs outlined by the Cairns Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my meetings with Arthur Dunkel last week he made it quite clear that he was resolved to craft this compromise because the majors have as yet not managed to reach the compromises themselves. There are high level contacts continuing in Europe between the United States and the European Community. The Cairns Group has signalled in relation to those bilateral meetings that anything that emerges from those bilateral meetings must be multilateralised and must be acceptable to all of the 108 parties meeting in the Round. I believe that the action that Arthur Dunkel will take tomorrow will ensure a package which tries to address the interests of all the major players in the Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that package has been tabled, I intend to inform all honourable members and the general community of its contents. However, I have to say that the package will be a comprehensive one encompassing all parts of the Round. It is one that will require careful analysis. It will not be possible to respond immediately so the Government will not be delivering any immediate judgment on the package. The response will follow careful consideration by the Cabinet here, but also careful consideration in consultation with our Cairns Group colleagues because we wish to continue the work we have done with them over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I hope that the major players in the international community will take the same careful and considered response as this country has taken to the package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House censures the Prime Minister for allowing his government to be destabilised and rendered impotent over the issue of leadership at a time when:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) a million Australians are unemployed with little chance of getting a job;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) the Australian economy has been in recession for five consecutive quarters;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) business investment has ground to a halt and bankruptcies are running at record levels;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Australia's foreign debt of $166 billion is a crushing burden on every Australian worker; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) the Labor government has manifestly failed its responsibilities to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The censure of a Prime Minister is a very important matter, in particular the censure of a Prime Minister in the circumstances in which we find this nation today; namely, the worst economic circumstances for 60 years. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over the period since the last election, now nearly 20 months, has allowed a continuing process of destabilisation to undermine his leadership and his Government, to the point of total paralysis. In fact, the situation has been left to drift and our economy has now slipped into the worst recession, as I say, in 60 years. Most recently we have seen some of the manifestations of that economic slide. Most important and alarming is the significant increase in unemployment in the course of the last couple of years as the economy has slid into that very deep recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we saw the unemployment rate reach 10 1/2 per cent, the highest level since the 1930s. There are over 900,000 Australians recorded officially as unemployed. Of course, we know that that official statistic dramatically understates the full magnitude of the unemployment crisis in Australia, where there are some 500,000 or 600,000 other Australians who cannot get the work they want. Approaching 17 or 18 per cent of our work force today is directly or indirectly touched by unemployment. That means that not one family in Australia today can really stand up and say it is not directly or indirectly touched by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we also saw the release of the balance of payments number, $1.7 billion, a number that is staggering in its size, given the depth of the recession. I put it to the Prime Minister that a few years ago there would not have been an economist who would have been prepared to concede that our balance of payments monthly number could be as high as $1.7 billion in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the outcome of the paralysis of policy and leadership that has characterised this Government since the last election. It is very hard to point to any significant attempt, let alone decision, to deal with those problems in that time. Undoubtedly the Prime Minister would point to the Budget as an occasion when he attempted to deal with those problems, but already it is conceded by the new Treasurer (Mr Willis) that that Budget is dead in the water, that its growth assumptions were unbelievably optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular the Government completely misread the state of the international economy, and we have implicit recognition now that perhaps 1992 will be worse than 1991. We have already had five consecutive measured quarters of negative growth in the Australian economy. It is a staggering admission on the part of the Government, in the one major attempt it has made to deal with the problem, that the Budget itself was dead in the water within a very short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when the Prime Minister and the new acting Treasurer or temporary Treasurer rise to deal with this motion, they will spell out their current assessment of the Australian economic circumstances and where our economy is headed in 1992. It is fundamental now to every Australian that an open and objective assessment be provided by the Government as to where we find ourselves in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. That has arisen because this Prime Minister has been so weak that he has allowed the continual destabilisation of his leadership and his Government by members of his own Party. It is not just back bench members of his Party, not just outer-Ministry members of his Party; it is also some of his key Cabinet colleagues who have repeatedly destabilised this man and his Government in the last 20 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of examples come to mind. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is a classic case. He has had a longstanding public role in undermining the credibility and direction of the Hawke Government. We can go back before the last election, to about October 1988 when, it will be recalled, that Minister&mdash;who should more appropriately be called the `Minister for unemployment'&mdash;went in and told the Prime Minister it was time to go. Even right back then before the last election, or immediately after the last election, this man&mdash;the Prime Minister&mdash;did nothing about the undermining actions of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election there have been dozens and dozens of occasions on which we have seen evidence in the media that that Minister has continued to undermine this Prime Minister. For example, immediately after the last election campaign the `Minister for unemployment' predicted that the economy would get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Ronald Edwards)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition should refer to Ministers by their appropriate title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, who is a principal cause of the level of unemployment, predicted immediately after the last election campaign that the economy would get much worse than the Government had forecast, not because he had any commitment to the truth but because he had an irrational hatred of this Prime Minister. One can go through the following 18-month period and see the magnitude of the debilitation, the extent to which that Minister has undermined this Prime Minister. For example, that Minister spoke to the press gallery and publicly called on the Government to develop a `pick the winners' industry policy, speaking deliberately and consciously outside his portfolio and knowing that it would undermine the Prime Minister&mdash;not because he had any genuine belief in industry policy, but because he wanted to continue to undermine the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, on Australia Day this year the Minister for Employment, Education and Training called on the Government to adopt the policies of Gough Whitlam. It shows how frustrated he was getting, when he resorted to a call for the policies of Gough Whitlam. Again this was not because he had any particular interest in those policies, but because he wanted to undermine the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently the Minister went on and blamed the Government's float of the Australian dollar as being the major cause of some of our economic problems. That was the one decision that the Prime Minister had publicly identified himself with as being a great success in his early years in government, and the Minister for Employment deliberately sought to undermine the Prime Minister by drawing attention to the fact that he believed that that float decision was a mistake. Again this Prime Minister sat by and showed a complete lack of leadership in failing to deal with a blatant act of disloyalty by one of his principal Cabinet Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the ALP conference this year that same Minister tried to launch a debate on immigration, not because he had any particular interest in the issue of immigration, and not because he even tried to relate it to the labour market and the emerging unemployment crisis in this country, but because he knew that the issue of immigration went to the very heart of one of the areas always cherished by this Prime Minister as a particular area of his own interest and success. Again, that Minister sought to undermine the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after that conference there was another good example of that Minister's going public. He said that there had been a distinct failure of leadership at the conference. That was more or less a veiled attempt to again undermine the Prime Minister. And so it has gone on. There have been dozens of occasions when the Minister for Employment has deliberately and knowingly set out to undermine the Prime Minister. On every occasion this Prime Minister has just stood there, or sat there, and done nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples, within the front bench and within the innermost sanctums of the Caucus, of senior Ministers undermining this Prime Minister. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is another classic example. On behalf of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), she torpedoed the Prime Minister's new federalism policy. Indeed, she wanted to make sure, after the challenge of the honourable member for Blaxland failed back in June, that his chances were kept alive and well. She took onto her staff the ex-press secretary of the honourable member for Blaxland so that the honourable member could continue to have the press resources of a Minister at his disposal and so that he could continue to wage the leadership campaign against this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) is another classic example, and we saw him at Question Time today. He and the others are all Judases on the front bench of the ALP, deliberately and knowingly undermining this Prime Minister. Of course, the original Judas had a basic sense of decency; he at least had the sense to go out and hang himself after the betrayal. But not this lot. This lot stayed and continued to betray. This lot continued to put out their hands for the 30 pieces of silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate betrayer, the ultimate underminer, the ultimate wrecker, was the honourable member for Blaxland, who was relegated to the back bench. If he gets up tonight, he will bring with him two monuments which will be recognised in the history of this country. The first, of course, will be the nearly one million Australians who are unemployed as a result of the recession that he said we had to have. Nobody else believes we ever had to have it. He will have the distinction of being the first Labor Prime Minister to destroy his own Party. The honourable member for Blaxland is a classic in the tradition of Jack Lang. Today I came across a quote worth putting on the record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a copious ability to hate and envy anyone whom he thought was financially, socially or intellectually superior, especially if that individual appeared to be a rival . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a description of Jack Lang. But does it not fit Jack Lang's student, the honourable member for Blaxland, the ultimate underminer, the man who set out on a clear cut course to wreck this Prime Minister and this Government? He has brought this Government to its knees in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years, when this Prime Minister and his Government have been unable to deal with the emerging economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the principal reason why this Prime Minister ought to be censured. But a second very important reason is that this Prime Minister has no sense of direction, no sense of vision, no real understanding of the needs of the people of Australia and has spent the great bulk of the last 18 months not only being obsessed with the protection of his job, irrespective of the costs of other jobs around Australia, but he has also been obsessed with trying to destroy us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never have we seen that obsession more pronounced and extreme than in the last four weeks since we released the Fightback package, where he completely misread the direction in which we would go in relation to rebuilding the Australian economy and found himself absolutely flat-footed and unable to deal with a very clear-cut sense of direction and vision for this country. The big difference that we highlight in the Fightback program that this Prime Minister has just not been able to come to grips with is that we, in that document, do not put our faith in government, bureaucracy, mates, union leaders, business mates, lobbyists or some of those who have managed to extract unbelievable deals out of this Government; we put our faith in the average Australian, in the people of Australia. This country will be rebuilt by the average Australian as an individual, as a member of a family, as a person running his business or trying to expand his business. It is that group of people who will rebuild this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package has struck a chord with average Australians because it has tapped their mood, their hope, their vision for this country and their embarrassment about the extent to which this Government has undermined our standing as a nation in the world as a whole, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is to be censured for two principal reasons: firstly, the total lack of leadership that he has shown over the course of the last 18 to 20 months as he has allowed a succession of his innermost Cabinet to undermine him publicly and privately and reduce his Government to a point where it is totally paralysed and unable to deal with the worst economic circumstances in 60 years; and, secondly, he has been unable to respond positively, he has only been able to respond negatively, to a clear-cut alternative which gives a sense of direction, vision and hope for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extreme nature of this man's obsession about destroying the Fightback package is the clearest commentary on just how far out of touch he now is with the people of Australia. The people of Australia are not the slightest bit interested in whether the Prime Minister can destroy our package. They are not the slightest bit interested in how many hours are put in by the Treasury staff, the Finance staff and the Employment Department staff in an attempt to find numerical holes in our package. They are not the slightest bit interested in any of that; they are interested to see whether the Prime Minister has any clear-cut sense of direction and commitment to the future of this country, whether he can understand the hardship that they now feel, and whether he can give them some hope and some sense of direction out of the mire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing is that as the Prime Minister has gone around Australia&mdash;I have followed him to some of the towns that he has gone to&mdash;he has not listened to what the people have been saying to him, whether they have been saying it to him on talk back radio or at lunch time meetings. I notice that, on most occasions, he does not take questions so he does not give them a chance to get to him directly, but he certainly has not listened to what they have said to him. They do not want bickering, fighting and political game playing and they do not want outlandish claims and blatant lies about our figuring.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They want the Prime Minister to develop an alternative sense of direction for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have seen what the Prime Minister's style of Government has done in the last eight years. They wish that he could rise above the mire and that he could take a clear-cut view of the direction in which this country has to go. The Prime Minister could make a genuine political fight out of the period between now and the next election by presenting an alternative and arguing that alternative so that the people of Australia are given a real choice at the next election as to which way this country can and should go as a result of a change of government at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other disturbing feature of what is now emerging in this leadership battle&mdash;I guess it is true; it does not matter who wins tonight&mdash;is that we will see the worst features of a tired and visionless Government. I think that either one will ditch any sense of economic respectability and responsibility; there will be a dramatic policy U-turn; and we will see a resort to the old pump priming, infrastructure, government expenditure style projects to try to get us out of our difficulties. That is the last thing that this country could possibly contemplate in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we have done in recent days is to take the Government's Murphy model and look at what might happen if in that model the Government were to proceed down the path of a February mini-Budget with, let us say, a 2 per cent cut in interest rates across the board and an increase in government expenditure of about $1 billion a year. It is a fairly modest package, I fear, compared with what the Government would do whoever is to win tonight, but the consequences for the Australian economy are horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real risks, and a principal risk, is that of an exchange rate crisis. Not only has the domestic confidence of both consumers and business leaders been shot in recent days by this debilitating leadership contest but also international confidence in Australia could easily be shot. If that were to happen, as shown in this analysis, the exchange rate could fall quite significantly. So we would suddenly see a return to the higher inflation days; a jump in inflation of somewhere between 3.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent as a result of that further drift in policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, it might be possible to create 50,000 or 60,000 jobs under that sort of scenario. It may be possible that they will not be real jobs, they will not be sustainable jobs and they will be created only by a significant increase in our international debts yet again at the cost, roughly, of $100,000 in debt per job. That is the prospect that the Australian economy has under either alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter whether Hawke or Keating gets up tonight. There will be a major policy U-turn in this country which will blow this country out of the water and inflict much greater pain and hardship on average Australians than they have yet endured, and they have already endured the worst recession in 60 years. It is a sad commentary on just how far out of touch both the honourable member for Blaxland and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) are that their insane personal ambitions have thrown this economy into the worst circumstances in 60 years, and their solutions will inflict further pain and hardship on average Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me just make a couple of observations about some of the personality issues that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) introduced in his speech this afternoon. He referred to the fact that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) came to see me in 1988 and that I did nothing about it. I listened to what Mr Dawkins had to say and then I went on with the business of government and won the 1990 election. That is what I did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different ways in which an individual can handle representations or attacks upon himself: he can get into a lather, he can start wielding big sticks and throwing his weight around, or he can listen and then make the decision that he will quietly get on with the job of governing. I chose to do that in 1988. All I can say is that I plead guilty to the result of having beaten the mob opposite pointless in the 1990 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really want to go on, however, with the issues of substance that are involved in the attack which the Leader of the Opposition has made upon me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity afforded by the motion of the Leader of the Opposition to address the real issues confronting this nation and, may I say, to expose once again the hypocrisy of those opposite. As I have had cause to say before, and as I said earlier today, in 1993 there will be a clear choice for the people of Australia. That choice will be a stark one. It will be a choice which will highlight the fundamental differences of philosophy, policies and approach between the two sides of politics in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has gone to his package. Let me say that nowhere&mdash;absolutely nowhere&mdash;are those stark differences between Labor and the tories more evident, nor are they better illustrated anywhere else, than in the Opposition's consumption tax package. It is for that reason that this motion is in its essentials about that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear choice in 1993 will be this: it will be between a coalition committed on its own admissions to an immediate rise in unemployment, to higher interest rates, to a sharp rise in inflation, to a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services&mdash;the essential necessities of life&mdash;to an increase in the foreign debt, to a massive redistribution of the national wealth in favour of the top 15 per cent of the nation's income earners, to the destruction of Medicare, to the destruction of the social wage, to a reduction in real wages and to an era of industrial confrontation and disruption without parallel in postwar Australia. That is their promise, that is their boast and that is their vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the people of Australia will have the choice of a government which will have restored growth, which will be creating jobs and which has beaten inflation; a government which will continue to deliver tax reform and to do that in the context of a strong and restructured economy. It will be a government delivering on jobs. It will be a government delivering on inflation, delivering on micro-economic reform, delivering on fair, modern and efficient welfare, health and education systems. And it will be a government delivering to this generation and future generations of Australians an internationally competitive economy built on the foundation of fairness, justice, equal opportunity and cooperation. That is our commitment, that is our achievement and that is our vision. </PARA>

It works in this way: workers on $20,000 get a gain in after tax income of 4.8 per cent. Remember, on $20,000 one gets a gain in after tax income of 4.8 per cent. On $30,000, the level of average weekly earnings, it is 6.8 per cent. But if one earns $75,000, as only 2 per cent of wage and salary earners do, the gain in after tax income is not 4.8 per cent or 6.8 per cent; it is almost 15 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the magic pudding of the Leader of the Opposition. He claims that everyone is a winner, but how did he get to the conclusion that everyone is a winner? He got there simply by ignoring the impact of these regressive proposals that are included in it. The critical decisions which adversely affect households&mdash;the net $4 billion reduction in outlays&mdash;will not impact upon the rich; they will hurt the poor. So by ignoring, as my colleague the Treasurer said, the regressive impact of the reduction of these services, he comes out and says that this magic pudding has produced this situation where everyone in this country is better off. This is absolutely untrue, and the tragedy is that the Leader of the Opposition knows that it is untrue. That is the magnitude of the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 15 per cent consumption tax would create a whole new area of tax avoidance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is perhaps just as interesting in terms of the Opposition Leader's commitment to micro-economic reform and efficiency is the area of road user charges. I will spend no more time on this than to remind this House and this nation of what the Leader of the Opposition said in his document. I read it again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall level of road user charges and road expenditures will be the responsibility of the National Road Transport Commission. Charges and taxes on road users and the level of expenditure on roads will no longer be subject to the vagaries of the political or budget processes which have produced wild fluctuations in rates of charges and levels of expenditure in past years.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, on the Leader of the Opposition's own statement, his micro-economic reform in this centrally important area depends upon the imposition of charges. But I snookered him the first day after he released the package. He said, `No, we will take off the excise on petrol; you will get the benefit there'. By definition, the only way he can deliver, if he is going to deliver, is by a massive increase in registration charges. But when, in the late night confrontation with the National Party, he was told, `Not on your nelly', he caved in. He will not get the revenue to do the micro-economic reform by charges on petrol or road user charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On what clearly will be an historic day in the political history of Australia, we have just witnessed possibly the swan song of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The House has been subdued, because I think the gallery and honourable members on both sides realise that it is an extraordinary circumstance in which the Prime Minister has presented a letter saying he will resign as leader of his Party at 6.30 p.m. tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin by addressing some of the points the Prime Minister brought forward in the debate and highlighting one factor he completely ignored in his examination of the coalition Fightback package. In that context, I can do no better than refer to the remarks of Dr John Bell, one of Senator Button's senior public servants, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, who has no brief for the Opposition. He said recently that the current taxation regime, particularly with regard to sales tax, creates a 5 per cent disadvantage for all Australian export industries, on all Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not come from the Opposition; it comes from Dr John Bell, a senior public servant in John Button's Department. The Fightback package abolishes that sales tax disadvantage to our exporters and provides the framework for our export industries to get up off the floor and to generate jobs and economic active by removing the horrific 5 per cent disadvantage which should have been abolished by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a second point in respect of the Prime Minister's address. He wants to talk about the regressive nature of our package. He is wrong on two counts. Dr John Edwards, senior consultant economist to the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), said last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has made a plausible effort to arrange the tax cuts and the social security compensation so that the poor are not worse off as a result of the imposition of the goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Another aspect of the argument about the regressive nature of the goods and services tax is the question of superannuation. This Government has presided over some very regressive treatment of superannuation, where the rich have got bigger and better tax breaks &mdash;more than Mr and Mrs Average Worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition Fightback package we are addressing that in a way which is absolutely fair. If that is not enough, let me turn to a list of 14 organisations which have come out in support of the package: the National Farmers Federation; the Voluntary Health Insurance Association; the Motor Trades Association; the National Catholic Education Commission; the National Council of Independent Schools Associations; the Australian Supermarket Institute; the Australian Institute of Company Directors; the Australian Livestock Transporters Association; the BCA; the CAI; the Housing Industry Association; the Institute of Chartered Accountants; the Metal Trades Industry Association; the New South Wales Farmers Association; and the National Association of Forest Industries. Those organisations, to name but some, have all come out and strongly supported the integrity and vision of the alternative conferred by the coalition Fightback package successfully launched by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) several months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that in his final attack when at the dispatch box, in his attack on the coalition package, the Prime Minister is wrong. I put it to the House that the strong endorsement by the community, reflected by opinion polls and by the comments of organisations, show very clearly that people are satisfied with the alternative vision, with the vision which will create jobs and give people a chance to have a go and get off the dole list, which will boost industry, which will boost exports in a responsible way. People are attracted very much to the coalition package. I read the press releases of the Forest Industries Association with particular interest, as does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) and other frontbenchers. We noted yesterday its very strong criticisms of the resources security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the Caucus's problem is that it faces Hobson's choice: a paralysed Hawke versus a pathetic Keating. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) occasionally gets around his electorate beyond Mount Isa. He has done his soundings. Last week he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>He is unacceptable in the bush. Senator Margaret Reynolds, based in Townsville in far north Queensland, which is well known to me and many others who visit there regularly, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You cannot give Keating away.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week, in a famous press release which may go down in history as the one most used&mdash;especially in the electorate of Swan&mdash;between now and the next election, whenever it might occur, Senator Jim McKiernan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 900,700 reasons why Keating should not be Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth of the matter is that the Caucus, the Parliament and the country have run out of confidence in the Prime Minister and in the honourable member for Blaxland, as demonstrated by the polls and as would be demonstrated if the Parliament had a secret vote on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one other key issue. What right has the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party to bludgeon Caucus into accepting its choice as Prime Minister? What right does the New South Wales Right have to impose a Prime Minister on this nation against the will of the Parliament, against the will of the people? That is what we will face at 6.30 tonight. I put to honourable members the chilling terms of the letter by the Prime Minister which I sought to table earlier today. The letter, dated 19 December, which is addressed to the Caucus Chairperson, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident to me that there is now an intention to challenge my leadership before the Parliament rises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe in these circumstances that it is in the interests of the Party and the Government that this issue be resolved at the earliest reasonable opportunity and in the least disruptive manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this purpose and to avoid, therefore, any requirement for any show of hands or signing of a petition, I request you to convene a special meeting of the caucus at 6.30 pm today. At that meeting I will tender my resignation as Leader and offer myself for re-election and go to a secret ballot if anyone wishes to challenge me for this position.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should listen to the last paragraph of this extraordinary letter. Here is the nub. This is the last paragraph of a letter from a Prime Minister who has led the Labor Party to four election wins, for reasons various. This is the last plea he had to insert into this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should there be such a challenge I would ask that all members be released from any suggestion of having to show their ballot paper to any other member.</PARA>
<PARA>What a shameful comment from the Prime Minister. The bludgeoning, the bulldozing New South Wales Right is so out of hand that the Prime Minister of this country has to ask for a fair dinkum secret ballot in his own Caucus, not the show and tell method so well practised in the New South Wales State Parliament by the honourable member for Robertson, (Mr Walker), the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), and other members who have graduated from that university of hard knocks&mdash;the bear pit of the New South Wales Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has given the lie to how democratic this ballot will be in the Caucus tonight. The Prime Minister has had to plead on bended knee for a truly secret ballot to decide who will be Prime Minister beyond this day for the few remaining twilight months of this particular administration. That is simply not good enough. I say to the House that the New South Wales Right has no right to decide who will be Prime Minister of this nation. I say further to the House that the sooner we have a fair dinkum Federal election so that the people can decide who gets the keys to the Lodge the better for the sake of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key issue has involved the total tearing up of the Westminster convention on Cabinet solidarity in recent months. Minister after Minister has directly and indirectly attacked this Prime Minister. Then we had the famous activities of last week when the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) led the six-pack into the office of the Prime Minister. There was the Minister for Finance, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray), the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). This famous six-pack wheeled into the office; this famous six-pack blinked; this famous six-pack departed the office. But every Westminster convention was torn up because the six-pack did not offer to resign in accordance with Westminster convention; the six-pack decided to hang on. I must add that in those circumstances they have certainly tainted themselves in their conduct and their modus operandi as Ministers and frontbenchers of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight what has happened since this Parliament last met. Not only have we had a Cabinet and a Government in absolute chaos, a Government in policy paralysis; we have had a Government that can do no better than attack a fair dinkum alternative which honestly seeks to address the problems facing Australia. This Government just did not wake up to the fact that every time it did that it enhanced the credibility and the standing of Dr Hewson and the coalition Fightback package. This Government, as a result of its actions over the last month, has demonstrated its incompetence, its lack of integrity and its selfish cynicism. It has now reached a stage where it will be a rich irony that the Prime Minister, whose popularity is now 17 percentage points lower than the popularity of Bill Hayden when Hawke took over as the leader of the ALP, will have to go out to Government House to hand in his resignation to the same Bill Hayden, now Governor-General of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Prime Minister must resign. He cannot shy away from his responsibility for the recession. The Prime Minister cannot shy away from the fact that he has continuously and dishonestly raised community expectations about this recession, when he must have had figures from his office telling the story as it is. During the last election campaign the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no need to fear a recession in any sense.</PARA>
<PARA>That was before we had the one million unemployed and before we had the five consecutive quarters of negative growth spelt out in this motion. In May of this year the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The signs of the recovery will be apparent in the second half of the year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the second half of this calendar year. There is no recovery, Prime Minister. There is no recovery, members of the Cabinet and Caucus. The trouble is that so many of them are embedded in the cocoon of Canberra, so many are embedded in the rhetoric of the Treasury and the mandarins of economic advisers to this Government that they have no idea of the extent of economic misery existing across Australia today. I take the point that it is wrong to blame the people of Canberra as they ride their bicycles around on their hot mix bitumen freeway bicycle paths for the recession we did not have to have. But it is in order to blame the elements of this Government and the elements of Treasury and Finance who delivered to the rest of Australia this recession we did not have to have. They delivered it ahead of the real impact of the drought; they delivered it ahead of the world recession; and they delivered an economic downturn deeper than that in the rest of the world. I sheet home the blame to Canberra, to this Prime Minister and to the former Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that the Prime Minister must resign. He has given misleading quotes which have given people false hopes which have been dashed in this Christmas time. I remind honourable members that in October the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's (recovery)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of the economy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">already started to come out. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's not a massive recovery but we are coming off the bottom. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the economy will be really moving by the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>He had another six months on that particular projection. The truth of the matter is that all those projections are false hopes, because the fundamentals are wrong. The fundamental economic policies are so wrong and the economic situation so serious that this new Treasurer, in the course of seven days, has completely changed his attitude and is now looking for an economic U-turn. I say to the House that there is only one U-turn which will stack up: when John Hewson is Prime Minister of Australia; when we have the coalition Fightback policy on the legislative books of this nation; and when we have fair dinkum alternative policies in place which abolish seven taxes, greatly reduce three other taxes, including massive reductions in income tax, and create jobs for millions of Australians who have been forced onto the jobless queues. </PARA>

They built this economy and industrialised it in completely the wrong way, which they implicitly acknowledge by the fact that they now argue for completely opposite policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the ones in government who have undertaken the brunt of the task of making this fundamental structural change to the Australian nation, because we recognised before those opposite that the course that had been pursued for the previous 33 years was immensely damaging and could not be sustained by the Australian nation. We had to change the structure of our economy because the structure which depended overwhelmingly on exports of commodities and essentially value added products was not going to enable this country to continue to grow and expand, to maintain anything like full employment and improved living standards for the rest of this century, let alone the next century. This Government has embarked on the enormous amount of structural change necessary to put us on a path where the Australian nation can have some real hope of becoming a leading economic nation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has been no paralysis in that sense and there has been no paralysis either in the sense of dealing with the short term nature of the economy. Of course there are economic difficulties. There are economic difficulties in almost every country in the Western world; recessions are all over the place. In particular, most countries which have a GST still have not been able to avoid an economic slowdown, and many of them are in recession. So proposing the GST as some solution for recession is simplistic nonsense of the worst kind. The fact that this Government has continually addressed policy to try to get the economy back onto a growth path is shown by the Budget, which involved a significant turnaround from the $8 billion surplus of a couple of years ago to a $5 billion deficit this year, a very substantial turnaround allowing the full play of the automatic stabilisers and some slight discretionary easing. The 10 reductions in official interest rates have meant that monetary policy has been considerably loosened since the beginning of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has been this continuous process of adjustment. But quite clearly there are concerns, which I have acknowledged outside this House earlier this week, that maybe there is need for further adjustments of policy to be made. This nation, like virtually every other nation in the Western world&mdash;certainly all the English speaking ones&mdash;is suffering the acute difficulty of economic management at a time when, through the 1980s, there has been a corporate debt binge with financial deregulation and an asset price boom, the management of which by the economic authorities has been extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This corporate debt binge has changed the nature of economic reactions by corporations which are now very much concerned about redressing their balance sheets rather than investing. Also, the asset price boom and the collapse of prices subsequent to that have added greatly to that difficulty. We are in somewhat unique economic circumstances and they do make the processes of economic management at this time a difficulty for many countries which have experienced much the same kind of circumstance. That is not an excuse; it is simply stating the real facts. The facts are that we recognise that the policies have to be put in place which will get Australia back on a sustainable growth path, sustainable in terms of maintaining low inflation and in terms of not going back to the kinds of balance of payments difficulties which marked the economy two or three years ago. We can do that. We are in a position now to lock in the low rate of inflation which we now have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the December quarter we will almost certainly see inflation drop below 2 per cent, and probably well below. The underlying rate will be a bit above that, but we are looking at exceedingly low levels of inflation. We are also able to have a real opportunity to lock that in because we have an accord in which the trade union movement has agreed, in relation to wages policy, to seek wages outcomes which will enable the inflation rate of this country to be comparable to those of our major trading partners. So there is in that sense a real opportunity to lock in the low inflation rate and for Australia uniquely to make that most important structural adjustment and to go into the rest of the 1990s as a low inflation country with inflation rates less than those of our major trading partners. It is a position that we very rarely enjoy. We have enjoyed it only momentarily at spots in time; it is not some continuing feature of our economy which has given our industries a real chance to export and to become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the kinds of developments which are available to us now. The task is to get back onto that growth path as quickly as possible, so long as we do not do it in some way which blows the opportunities we now have in terms of low inflation and achieving long term growth, including substantial levels of economic and employment growth, without bringing about the problems of rising foreign debt. There is no policy paralysis. I indicated earlier this week that there is a mid-term review of economic policy taking place at the present time of our Budget forecast. If that review, which we will publish when it is available in late January, shows that we will significantly undershoot our economic forecasts, then we will certainly be prepared to adjust policy to try to get to the kinds of levels of growth for 1992 and beyond that we forecast in the Budget. The Budget was somewhat bullish about employment in 1992. </PARA>

In those circumstances, what do those opposite think the Reserve Bank is going to do&mdash;the independent Reserve Bank which they have told has to have an inflation rate of no more than 2 per cent? Those opposite are going to put 5 per cent in there and loosen fiscal policy by $5 billion. Where do they think interest rates will go?

They say, `Let's let everybody go out there; let employers screw the workers. Let them hire them at wages less than the award rate. It does not matter. We are not concerned about minimum standards. We don't mind. Let all the conditions of employment be taken away. In areas where unions are strong, they can work up big wage deals&mdash;which means we will get a wages blow-out. Well, so what?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Treasurer, when asked to speak in defence of the Prime Minister, attacks the Opposition but fails to utter one word of support for the Prime Minister. Presumably, the Treasurer is more concerned about his job, following the reshuffle, than he is about the Prime Minister's job and defending him. If the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, is right and the first leader he replaces is the one he tears down, and if he tears down the Prime Minister in the Caucus meeting at 6.30 tonight, today will be an historic day in Australian politics at two levels: the level of the personality of the Prime Minister and, secondly, the more important level, the direction which this country will take in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the personality level, the Prime Minister will be the first Labor leader post war to be executed by his own Caucus. It will be the end of the longest serving period for a Labor Prime Minister, and it will be the end of the prime ministership of the most successful&mdash;electorally&mdash;Labor Prime Minister in Australia's history, who is to be replaced by the ex-Treasurer whose policies have brought about the highest unemployment since the Great Depression in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a symbol of what has been going on within the Government in the last few weeks that captures the totality of Government members' thinking, it was last week when the unemployment figures were released. It was a classic. It showed how these people think. On the day that the unemployment figure came out showing the highest number of unemployed since the 1930s&mdash;10.5 per cent, or 900,700 Australians unemployed &mdash;Government members, instead of going into crisis mode and being concerned about the level of unemployment, were having secret conspiratorial meetings, one lot trying to keep the Prime Minister in the top job and the other lot trying to dislodge him from the top job and install `Mr Recession', the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland. There was absolutely no concern for those 900,000 Australians unemployed and no concern whatsoever&mdash;not a second thought&mdash;for the business people and the small investors who have seen their dreams shattered as a result of this Government's economic incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members did not stop to consider for a moment that nearly one in three young Australians is unemployed as a result of the Government's policies. These young people will be scarred for life as a result of this Government's failure. Government members are more concerned about their own jobs than anybody else's job. That says a lot about this Government and its priorities. That is what the day the unemployment figures were released showed: when it comes to jobs, the only jobs these people are interested in are their own jobs and nobody else's&mdash;the Prime Minister trying to keep his job and the ex-Treasurer trying to get it. It does not really matter who wins, they will both go on jointly putting themselves ahead of the community that they were elected to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the two combatants, the two protagonists at the top; it is all their soldiers too. On the one hand, there are the Hawkites, the new Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley)&mdash;and I do not suppose he will be Minister for Finance for long&mdash;and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), whichever side he is on; on the other, there are all the Keatingites, spending all their time, running up all their phone bills, and using all their stationery, officers and staff in actively pushing their own ambitions. This Government&mdash;not just the Prime Minister, but this Government and all the various factions which it comprises&mdash;has put itself ahead of the people and has failed the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the Prime Minister's defence today in response to the censure motion also highlighted the second and substrata issue that I think today's events bring forward. When we placed a censure motion against the Prime Minister and sought his response to the charge of economic mismanagement, he spent virtually the whole of his speech attacking the Opposition. We have not been in office for eight or nine years. Today's problems are the problems of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why this Prime Minister finds himself about to be executed in the Caucus tonight, if that is what happens, is that when we released the Fightback program, a comprehensive set of sweeping reforms to fix Australia's long term economic problems, this Government, which for 12 or 18 months had been saying, `Just release it. We can't wait for the day when you guys release it. We can't wait for the chance to get our hands on it and to demolish it from day one', had no response and no vision whatsoever. This Government has been in office for eight years, and it does not have the vaguest idea of what to do next in terms of solving Australia's economic problems that the Government itself is largely responsible for.

The after tax increase for a person on $5,000 a year was 2.1 per cent; the after-tax increase for a person on $200,000 was not 2.1 per cent, it was 21.7 per cent. What incredible hypocrisy. It is just amazing that the Prime Minister could come in here and attack our package on the basis of so-called regressivity. Look at the Government's record, for heaven's sake&mdash;and that is not even half the picture. Government members have to look at the entirety of our package. What has absolutely gazumped the Government is the fact that our package is actually progressive; the people at the low end get proportionately more than people at the high end.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, people in the gallery and very few people in the public have had an opportunity to witness what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is saying. He turns up in zoos to look at the impact of the GST on animals and he goes to supermarkets and suggests that the average family buys seven kilos of dog food a week and about seven litres of Harpic&mdash;but no bread, no meat and no vegetables&mdash;and lives on various household poisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Opposition Leader wanders around the country with those picture opportunities, with the State-based media as opposed to the media here, he will find himself increasingly required to give some answers. He actually knows this; he knows that all the serious economic commentators in this country have picked him. He knows that they have gone through the effects of his package in terms of both its achievability and, if the attempt is made to achieve it, its actual effect on the economy. They have demonstrated comprehensively what nonsense it is. When he actually appears before business forums he says, `Ross this, Ross that. I have had this discussion with Ross. Ross will find this or that'. I wonder who this Ross is who keeps appearing whenever the Leader of the Opposition manages to find himself at any forum in which there is any likelihood of a serious intellectual analysis of the proposition he has put forward. He is extremely defensive, because that Ross happens to be Ross Gittins, who day after day in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has done an exercise on this package which has rendered it utterly, totally, intellectually impotent. That is the position in which the Leader of the Opposition finds himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a good position to be in, intellectually, 18 months out from an election; there is no question about that. If there is one thing that has to be understood about this package, it is this: this is the end of the Liberal Party's agenda as far as public presentation is concerned. It locks members of the Liberal Party in. This is what they will do. They will have nothing else to offer. Their position stands or falls on the viability of this package. What a thing to introduce into our society when what our society needs is major micro-economic reform, which it is getting from this Government, and major labour market reform, which it is getting from this Government and which ensures that the inflation rate that we now have gets locked in so that we are an internationally competitive nation. When those are the crying needs of this country, some bunch of loons marches down the main street with a lit bomb, like some nineteenth century anarchist looking for the grand duke so that they can lob the darn thing in his carriage, in order to start in the Australian economy the equivalent of World War I. That is what the Opposition mostly represents, if we are looking for historical analogies, as far as its package is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that package the material that has so concerned the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) gets 1 1/2 pages. The serried ranks of people who are supposed to be responsible for micro-economic reform in this country&mdash;these are central issues&mdash;get a couple of pages. But what else do we get? We get, again in that sort of military parlance that Winston Churchill was so fond of, the principle that in war time it is necessary for a central truth to be surrounded by legions of lies in order for it to be got through. What is the central truth of this package at the end of the day? Economic policy is to be subordinated to the introduction of the harshest goods and services tax around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the productivity of this darn country. What if I came into this chamber cold and said as Minister for Finance, `Have I got a top idea for Australian business. If you take an item and add value to it, I am going to tax it at 15 per cent when you on-sell it, and when you add a bit more value to that, we will tax it again at 15 per cent, and when you add a bit more value, we will again tax it at 15 per cent. There will be a rebate system down the line, so that at the end of the day it will be paid for by the person who ultimately picks it up.'?  If I said that that was my idea for increasing the productivity of this country, would anybody in this country think that I had come up with a good one? Would anybody in this country think that I had come up with what is going to be the thing that will lift Australians out of a malaise and will make them work harder and work better? Would  anyone seriously think that that would be a proposition? Yet this is what the Opposition invites us to think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable members one or two other things about goods and services taxes elsewhere. People who introduce such taxes, as they are in existence mainly in Europe, generally do so with at least a partial eye to what their impact is likely to be on the average household and a partial eye to the possibility that maybe one needs to introduce elements of equity into the package itself. Therefore, in many of the European countries in which a goods and services tax operates, it is levied at differential rates so that luxury items are taxed more heavily than items which are more in everyday use and, above all, items that are essential in everyday use are not taxed at all. Therefore, a far higher rate of exemption and a far higher level of equity are introduced into such packages.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another piece of nonsense from the Opposition. Opposition members stand and say in this place, `Listen, it is so unfair. You have a wholesale sales tax now. What does the Government say about the fairness of that?'. I have listened to the Opposition on that subject. I have listened to that argument. If what honourable members opposite are seriously proposing is, say, a goods and services tax levied at 5 per cent, there is no doubt at all that at the various wholesale sales tax arrangements up to the 20 per cent mark, goods that were subject to a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax and then subsequently became subject to a 5 per cent GST would be cheaper. But the fact of the matter is that no goods under the wholesale sales tax, in so far as the taxation regime has an impact on its pricing&mdash;apart from those goods taxed at the 30 per cent level&mdash;are going to be cheaper. </PARA>

Honourable members opposite are saying that, in order to bring those goods down in terms of taxation treatment, they will keep in place taxation arrangements which already exist on a number of goods and bring into the taxation system a vast array of goods and services that ordinary people need. Of course, it is an act of great inequity as far as the community is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What amazes me is that the public has now begun to understand this. When we tried to get the old Australia Card through, we started off with about 80 per cent public approval. The goods and services tax has started off at about 50 per cent approval. Somehow through the flak in the media in the last couple of weeks, between the sort of extraordinary pic-fax of the Opposition Leader parading himself around the country, it has actually got through to the average Australians that there is a man waiting around the corner with a great big club with a 15 per cent marker on it, ready to whack them over the back of the head as they come through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business understands, too. I happen to know that from personal anecdotal evidence. Into my office a week ago came a man who has been a longstanding Liberal Party branch president in my electorate. He gave me what was effectively his resignation letter from the Liberal Party in Western Australia because he was a small businessman who had done his sums. He had made a calculation. He does not pay payroll tax, I might say, as one would expect, and 60 per cent of Australian small business does not. He had done his sums on what he would have to do in his accountancy arrangements to operate his business with a goods and services tax in place. He understood that he would be going to the wall. He did not think that this was a terribly good idea. So this fellow who, at least at the State level, had been a Liberal Party candidate from time to time in my electorate is a Liberal Party member and candidate no longer. That, of course, was a piece of intelligent analysis on his part. This will be more and more the feature. The Liberal Party has had the best run it is going to get on the goods and services tax. It has had the best of it. From this point on it will be hard slog uphill for honourable members opposite as each group in the community begins to understand the true ramifications of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis we do not need to worry too much about that sort of area. The Opposition will be found out. The population will understand that the Opposition will damage it; what the population may not understand, but will come to understand, is just how much the Opposition will damage the country. The policy settings that the Treasurer referred to will mean that in one year there will be a massive clawback, which will massively increase unemployment in this country, and in the next year there will be a huge fiscal surge into the economy, ultimately sending interest rates rocketing through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will introduce the situation where practically every conceivable impact on inflation that there is will be massively affected by the way in which the goods and services tax is introduced. But what is the coalition's answer to it? `Well, we will have the Prices Surveillance Authority run its eye over it'. Two or three years ago the coalition tried to abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority. The Opposition went into an election campaign with that approach.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite like the Prices Surveillance Authority. We on this side have an ongoing favourable disposition towards it, but we do not expect it to monitor something like a million businesses and a million taxation outlets for a goods and services tax in this country. Fair dinkum; we are not in the business of considering that that Authority will have that sort of capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have here, presented as a Liberal Party position as far as the future of this country is concerned, is a most terrible fraud. But fortunately it is an exposable one, and over the next 18 months we will have a great deal of joy, as a political exercise, going through it and pointing out what the employment and inflation impacts will be, how devastating it will be, and what a pathetic vision it is for the future of this country. We will start by shutting off this debate now to give us an opportunity to get out there to do that. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking of successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Prime Minister announced that the Government would formally respond to committee reports within six months of the tabling of a report. With a change in Government in 1983, there was also a change to the method of response to parliamentary committee reports. On 24 August 1983 the Leader of the Government in the Senate stated that irrespective of any undertaking by the previous Government, the Government had decided that responses to parliamentary committee reports would be made by way of a ministerial statement in Parliament. Furthermore, the period in which responses were to be made would be reduced from six months to three months. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament will be considered the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedule does not include reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Public Works nor the reports of the House of Representatives Members' Interests, Privileges, Publications and Selection Committees. Responses to reports of the Public Accounts Committee are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Senate by way of a question, Senator Tambling made serious allegations against me and allegations against members of the Gagudju Association, an Aboriginal organisation, and misled the Senate as to the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The substance of his allegation in respect of me was that I was an unauthorised consultant on a taxpayer backed management investment deal, whatever that meant. He also alleged that I had interfered in the internal affairs of the Gagudju Association, an Aboriginal organisation of traditional owners who own hotel properties at Jabiru and Cooinda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are, of course, that for some years I and my family have `had skin' with two Aboriginal organisations, Gagudju being one of them. `Having skin' simply means that one has been asked to become part of a clan. One becomes part of what is a broad Aboriginal community and family group. This carries considerable obligations. It is an honour which I was asked to take when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I was proud and pleased to accept that honour. It is not a token relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September of last year I was approached by Miss Jessie Alderson, the chairperson of the Gagudju Association who was concerned and worried about the financial and legal problems that were arising in respect of the future of both Cooinda and Crocodile hotels and she sought my assistance. That was not an offer that I could personally refuse, nor did I want to. I accepted her offer to assist on the basis of taking up an honorary consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the importance of both of those hotels to the tourism industry in the Northern Territory and having failed to contact Mr Vale, the Minister for Tourism in the Territory, I contacted the Chief Minister and told him of my involvement, of the objectives of the Gagudju Association and what I hoped to achieve. I also indicated to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and Senator Collins what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At various meetings the Gagudju Association has strongly indicated its desire to obtain greater involvement in the decisions concerning its own hotel properties with a view to ultimately managing them itself. My task has been simply to assist the realisation of those objectives against a number of competing agendas by various tourist groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management agreements are made frequently all over Australia. A fresh one was made only this week in the Northern Territory. What I find of concern here&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I will finish in a minute, sir. What I find of concern is that on the first occasion an Aboriginal group in Australia says `We want to learn how to manage and control our own hotels', it is the subject of attack and spurious allegations are made about its objectives and actions by Senator Tambling. I am proud of my association with the Gagudju Association and with other Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory. I leave it to Senator Tambling to explain, if he can, his public relationships with Aboriginal groups in the Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This will help facilitate the business of the House for the rest of the day and ensure that what is an extremely tight program is gone through. This is the first time since we have been in office that we have moved this motion; as a precedent, we have the shining example of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), who I believe was the last Minister to move this motion, no doubt for similar reasons&mdash;to ensure that for the rest of a very busy day the proceedings of the House can move along with a reasonable degree of expedition and concentration on the legislative issues that are before the House. With such an admirable and ample precedent before me, I have moved accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I expected that the Leader of the House would draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that I was the last Minister to move this resolution, but the circumstances were completely different. There were two basic differences. The first is that the Opposition at the time was disorderly and was frustrating the conveyance of legislation through the chamber. This is a very serious matter. The second difference is that between now and 8 p.m. this evening, when the House resumes after dinner, there is every indication that Australia could have a new Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not irrelevant. The Prime Minister and the Executive have a very important role in this country. What the Leader of the House is proposing now is a means by which the Opposition, for the remainder of today and, if the House happens to sit tomorrow, for the remainder of the sittings for this year, will have no capacity to move any motion concerning the changes that might occur tonight. Therefore, the circumstances are quite different. The Government is not just frustrating the Opposition. After all, a democracy is a system whereby the majority view prevails and the minority view is heard. On this occasion, the Leader of the House, with the support of the numbers of the Government, will take action to ensure that, for the remainder of this day, there will be no capacity for the Opposition to move any motion at all in relation to the monumental changes that are likely to occur tonight. We oppose the motion and we will vote against it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to remind honourable members about this Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill and the shabby and appalling way the Government has behaved, and to bring back some interesting comments that we made when this Bill was first considered by the Government. It was one of its shabbiest efforts so far to try to swing the pendulum its way when it comes up for re-election. It is worth noting that when the Government first considered this Bill the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)&mdash;the current Prime Minister for at least another two hours&mdash;was supposed to have said to some of his members of Cabinet in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that this bit of legislation would be very appropriate as it would `teach this kid a lesson'. I wonder who has learnt the lesson since this legislation has gone through its tortuous path. It has some 47 amendments, it has involved the Senate in a considerable amount of debate and now that it has reached this place there is considerable doubt about its legality from a constitutional point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) introduced the Bill he made some rather interesting introductory comments in his second reading speech about the duty of the representatives of the people in a democratic society. He said that this duty requires government which is free of corruption and undue influence. That is interesting to note, particularly coming from the Labor Party, a party that makes no bones about its close affiliation with the ACTU and the union movement, a party that has no problems with collecting the affiliation fees that come from the union movement. My colleague Senator Parer&mdash;and he has done quite a lot of work on this&mdash;believes that between $4m and $5m is provided to the Labor Party each year from the union movement. The Minister wants to talk about the duty that requires a government to be free of corruption and undue influence. I would have thought that $4m to $5m is quite a bit of influence. Apparently, when it comes to the trade union movement and its influence on the Labor Party, that is somehow different. As has been pointed out in another place, not only have the unions got this influence but also they have a very protected position when it comes to comparing the treatment of them and the treatment of other organisations before the Taxation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because time is short I will just make a couple of comments about some of the changes that have been brought in. Of course, it is the taxpayer who is going to foot the bill. We now have a situation where the Government has agreed, in order to keep its protected position for the union movement, that private donations of up to $100 will now be tax deductible. Obviously, this could mean that the taxpayer is indirectly going to be slugged even more. Not only will the Government be putting forward a position whereby all paid political advertising on radio and television is to be banned&mdash;and not only will this ban apply to Federal elections; it is going to apply to State and local government elections, by-elections and referendums&mdash;but also the Government is going to demand free time on radio and television. Likewise it is estimated that it is going to cost something like $8m to inform every household about who is standing in each election. Many people could abuse this by nominating themselves. For $250 they can get saturation exposure within an electorate; their name could become a household word, and if they are running a business it could be rather attractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another salient point, and that is whether such a Bill could be challenged on constitutional grounds. I draw the attention of honourable members to an opinion that has been given to the Opposition by Professor Zines, the Robert Garran Professor of Law at the Australian National University. Professor Zines raises some very interesting constitutional problems. First of all he looks at whether or not these provisions can validly operate in respect of State elections, whether there are substantial arguments against these provisions that concern Commonwealth elections and referendums, and whether the provision of free time is not inconsistent with the Constitution. The central provisions relating to State elections&mdash;if I can talk about State elections first&mdash;are contained in section 95D of the proposed Bill. Professor Zines says that, in his opinion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the law comes within the provisions of section 51(v) of the Constitution. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion, therefore, a federal law which purported to control the advertising of political matter in relation to a State election would be contrary to the implied constitutional prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very significant. So we already have some very strong constitutional questions over this legislation. In relation to State elections, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusion I have reached might also be derived from section 106 of the Constitution which provides, in part, that "the Constitution of each State of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth. . . </PARA>
<PARA>On that first point, the validity of this legislation in relation to State elections is obviously under some doubt from a constitutional point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second point, in relation to Commonwealth elections, Professor Zines points out that the provisions of the Bill relating to Commonwealth elections may be susceptible to constitutional attack by virtue of provisions of the Constitution relating to elections or under section 92 of the Constitution. Again, there is considerable doubt about the constitutional validity of this Bill as it relates to Commonwealth elections. On the third question that I was going to raise, Professor Zines says that there is some doubt, but he has not given a conclusive opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that we have 47 amendments before us, despite the fact that the Government has ignored considerable advice from the coalition parties in relation to the Bill, and despite the fact that, in view of the influence of the trade union movement, the Government is running a fairly hypocritical line when it talks about elections and those in public office having a duty to be free from undue influence, this Bill has considerable doubt about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting in passing that the Australian Democrats, despite their supposed concern about many provisions of this Bill, have allowed the Government to get away with this and have supported this. It is interesting to look a little below the surface to find out why this legislation would be so attractive to the Democrats. What has been found is that, under this legislation, the Democrats will be able to more than double the amount of television advertising they have had in the past. Some carrot, I would suggest!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Democrats may have stated during the debate in another place that they preferred less television advertising&mdash;and they have massively increased their own electronic advertising&mdash;the fact is that at the same time they will be denying the right to free time to many other parties and groups. They will be denied the opportunity of gaining free time&mdash;</PARA>

Just to show honourable members how much it has been worth, at the last Federal election the Democrats were able to afford $380,000 in electronic advertising. As a result of this Bill, they will get the equivalent of some $1.8m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining, let me say that the coalition parties have very strong reservations about the constitutional validity of some parts of this Bill. Obviously we have expressed our concern and our opposition on many occasions to the way the Government is approaching this and on the utter hypocrisy of the Government when it talks about trying to remove areas of undue influence while still quite happily accepting such huge sums from the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make to the honourable member is that it was the Liberal Party which proposed in the Senate that that deductibility should be unlimited; that if BHP wanted to make a $1m donation to the Liberal Party at the next election, then BHP should get a $500,000 tax deduction for that political donation. It was actually the Democrats who forced the Liberals and the Nationals to put a ceiling of $100 on that donation. I suggest that, if members of the public are concerned about a tax deduction for a donation to a political party, they should write to the Opposition because it was the Labor Party in the Senate that opposed that political donation. I would suggest that, if the honourable member is drawing our attention to those matters, perhaps he could draw the attention of honourable senators to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this measure so important?

We will end up with a system such as the one in the United States, where only the Rockefellers or the Heinzes can afford the tens of millions of dollars that are required to run for Congress. In effect, we are simply extending to commercial television the system of free time that now applies to the ABC. Those opposite say that this is a massive threat to democracy in this country, but it is a system that has worked in Maggie Thatcher and John Major's Britain for decades. It is a system that ensures that the political parties do not have to sell their souls to fund the cost of radio and television. This is a proposal that has not been rushed through.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) indicated, this amendment does correct drafting problems in relation to the pharmaceutical allowance, particularly an advance pharmaceutical allowance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not detain the House on this historic day because I know that members of the Caucus are very anxious to go and wield the guillotine. I simply point out once again the need for this amending legislation. It illustrates the shoddy nature of legislation from this tired Government which has run its term of office. The Government has to keep coming back to the Parliament with follow-up legislation to correct drafting mistakes, as is the case in this instance. I affirm that the Opposition is not opposed to this amending legislation. </PARA>

It was a privilege to go to Gallipoli with both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Prime Minister of this hour for the seventy-fifth anniversary. I could not fault the excellent arrangements for, and hosting of, that extremely important occasion. This amending legislation shows the price we in this Parliament pay for legislative gobbledegook by a Government which has not double-checked its legislation before it brings it before the House. However, the Opposition is not opposed to the measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the motion moved by the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Free), the coalition sought agreement in the other place and achieved Democrat support for the motion it moved, which provided that environmental impact expenses be deductible in the following circumstances: firstly, where the project proceeds, the expenditure is to be written off over three years; and, secondly, where the project does not proceed, the expenditure is to be deductible outright.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am disturbed to think the Government acted quite inappropriately in not accepting that series of amendments which were put forward by the coalition and agreed to by the Senate. This is a very important issue for industry and the environmental movement in this country. The motion that we moved and was successful in the Senate provides that environmental impact expenses would be deductible in the following circumstances: where the project did proceed, expenditure would be written off over three years; and where the project does not proceed, the expenditure is to be deductible outright. We believe that it is only just and equitable that where a project does not proceed, expenditure can be written off forthwith&mdash;particularly as in those circumstances no asset has in fact been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has now stated it will not support that amendment, as allowing for the expenses of an environmental impact study to be written off over that three-year period or, where a project does not proceed, for the expenses to be written off outright is providing a subsidy to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax deductibility of the expenditure to be written off over three years is not a subsidy. I substantiate that statement by putting to the chamber the following reasons. Firstly, the Industry Commission recommendations regarding depreciation&mdash;and there is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, 19 December 1991&mdash;indicate that an easing of depreciation rates is necessary. That Industry Commission report was set up by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). It gained Cabinet approval for the inquiry, and the brief to the Industry Commission was to study other countries' measures to boost exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has now come back and will recommend that the tax burden on industry be lowered and that tax depreciation measures be reviewed. That is precisely what our motion and amendment to the legislation in the Senate provided&mdash;that those depreciation measures be reviewed and certainly that environmental impact statements be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environmental impact statements, of course, are something which every level of government&mdash;local, State and Federal&mdash;has forced upon it by law. All of those EI statements are legitimate business expenses which we believe should be able to be written off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian accountancy profession also has recommended the three-year write-off period. I have in my possession a statement by the Taxation Institute of Australia regarding the environmental impact statements. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the income tax system unintentionally discourages taxpayers from undertaking certain environmental expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>I would not think anyone in the chamber, particularly the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), would argue with the proposition that it is necessary to undertake certain environmental expenditure and it is necessary to take out environmental impact statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Taxation Institute of Australia has set out an extremely good case in this matter. No doubt the Government has received that paper and the Minister handling this legislation obviously would be aware of it. But I understand that other countries, such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, have acted in various ways to remedy similar anomalies and, in some cases, have gone even further by deliberately encouraging expenditure in a variety of environmental programs through the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to remedy the technical deficiencies in Australia's tax laws has the effect of discouraging taxpayers from undertaking environmental expenditure. It also adds to the complexity and inefficiency of the income tax system, its cost to taxpayers, and it impedes Australian producers who are attempting to compete with overseas manufacturers and producers and could result in Australian producers relocating their operations offshore. That is exactly the issue the Industry Commission has identified in its latest report, which was reported today, Thursday, 19 December 1991, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Taxation Institute of Australia has quite clearly recognised the importance of this issue. It also points out and emphasises that its submission to ourselves and the Government does not seek subsidies or incentives for environmental expenditure, but rather the elimination of unintended consequences which discourage beneficial action by the recognition that expenditure on environmental matters is now, in response to community demands, an ordinary business expense. Of course it is, because at all levels of government, local, State and Federal, it is a requirement by law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also well to remember that, whilst no deduction is available to Australian companies for the cost of undertaking environmental impact studies and land rectification, deductions for donations to environmental groups are specifically allowable. The Government will not allow a deduction to any Australian company that is trying to do the right thing by undertaking what can at times be an expensive environmental impact study; yet deductions for donations to environmental groups are specifically allowable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute has proposed that with feasibility studies where the project proceeds a write-off period over three years be allowed; and where the project does not proceed, an outright deduction be allowed. The Australian accountancy profession has recommended, though, the three-year write-off. There is a need for Australia to be internationally competitive, and the adoption of three-year write-offs would put us in the forefront of environmental impact statement write-offs. The environmental impact statement expenses are a necessarily incurred expense required, as I mentioned, by all levels of government, Federal, State and local. The precedent for this has already been acknowledged in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) where preliminary expenses for exploration can be written off in the year of occurrence. Therefore, the same situation, I believe, should occur with environmental impact statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if we are searching for resources, whether it be for gold&mdash;I mentioned this in my contribution during the second reading debate&mdash;or for some other resource, one's taxation liability, the preliminary expenses for exploration, can be written off in the year of occurrence. We believe that should also occur with environmental impact studies. The Opposition amendment, which was moved and accepted in the Senate, recognises asset creation in the three-year write-off period. It is for those reasons that we register the coalitions's opposition to the Government not accepting the amendments which were moved and considered at great length in the Senate. I register the coalition's opposition to that proposal by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to support the comments made on behalf of the Opposition by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). The steady increase in the burdens which are imposed on industry in the interests of environmental management is a matter which, I suppose, has commanded the broad assent and support of both sides of this House. I think it is now generally accepted that in the carrying out of business in Australia we expect very high environmental standards. By law, it is frequently required that before business can be carried out there will be an environmental impact statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expense which is involved here is of a slightly different nature to the other expenses which are involved in seeking to establish a business because those expenses are, in a much more direct way, related to the public interest rather than the direct commercial interest of the taxpayer. I think that what illustrates the different nature of these expenses is the serious discussion which takes place about having the cost of environmental impact statements met not by the private but by the public purse. There is a quite serious argument that it would be sensible to have environmental impact statements publicly funded on the basis that those people conducting studies would then have their direct duty to the public, because many people who are concerned about the environment believe that, where a private enterprise body retains a consultant for the purpose of producing an environmental impact statement, there is essentially a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not put that forward here because it is a matter that we are considering legislating on or because it is Opposition policy, but because I think that argument acutely illustrates that in requiring environmental impact statements we are looking to the public rather than to the private interest. I think that there are very good arguments for saying that it should remain a private cost. We are saying that one of the problems of environment management is that so many costs are hidden. The environment is used as a free good. As a result, air, water and soil are degraded without regard to the long term economic cost to the country, to the community and, indeed, to the enterprise itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it seems to me to be flying in the face of reason to be saying to people who face what we would all regard as necessary environmental costs that those costs should not be regarded as costs which are necessarily incurred in carrying out the business. I think it is artificial to regard them as capital costs in the normal sense. I think that they are essentially costs which are there to provide information which enables the public interest to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is probably foremost in the world, not for its environmental record but for trumpeting its environmental record and then claiming that it demands the world's highest standards and so on&mdash;these are a much remarked upon feature of the approach of the Hawke Government&mdash;and, in those circumstances, there is some requirement of a bit of consistency. I say to the Minister handling this legislation that I think it sits oddly with the Government's rhetoric that it should knock back these amendments which were passed by the Senate and which I think are no more than a reasonable acknowledgment of the fact that it is the parliaments of Australia which have imposed these additional obligations on people. We have done that because we believe that by imposing those obligations we protect the public interest. In those circumstances it is clearly a cost which is necessarily incurred in carrying out business. It, in fact, has nothing to do with achieving a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, where carrying on business is very difficult, where thousands of small businesses and, indeed, some larger businesses have found the going all too hard to keep up and where a lot of people have gone bankrupt, I think we should be very careful when imposing statutory obligations on people to expect that cost to be borne out of after-tax income. That is essentially the case here. For that reason I wish to express my very great disappointment at the stance that the Government has taken. I do not know whether any discretion is left in Ministers in this place, but if there is any I would ask the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, to consider taking the legislation back and having it considered in light of the comments that have been made principally by the honourable member for Bendigo and also in light of my own comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has transmitted to the House the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, which is an omnibus Bill to amend various Acts in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill was debated in the other place on 26 November last and was passed on that day with amendments. In particular, the Senate rejected amendments which the Government had put forward with respect to section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903. In addition, the Senate inserted into the Bill amendments to section 9 of the Law Officers Act of 1964. It will be up to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to formally indicate the Government's position on those amendments. As I understand it, the Government is not going to, yet again, pursue the amendment to the Judiciary Act. As I understand it, it has indicated that it will not be accepting the Senate amendment to the Law Officers Act. I will go into the question of the Law Officers Act amendment a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before referring to that element, I mention briefly two other matters that are contained within the Bill, namely, the amendment to the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 and, secondly, the amendment to section 117C of the Family Law Act 1975. It is my intention to speak at some considerable length on this matter. It is a fairly historic moment and I rather doubt that in the whole sweep of human history many people will take much notice of amendments to the Law and Justice Act at 10 minutes past six when there is a decision to be taken at 6.30. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very good. I am green with envy. Section 5 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 will be amended to provide that State police, when investigating offences committed on Commonwealth land, are not bound by the provisions of part 1(c) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. The provisions found in part 1(c) were recently introduced by the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991, which was debated in the House on 13 February this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act was debated in the House, the Opposition expressed a concern that the legislation would give rise to operational complexities on the part of the State police and that in this respect the State police would be required to follow different investigatory rules, depending on whether they were investigating Commonwealth or State offences and, in some cases, both. That matter has now been attended to and was conceded by the Attorney in the second reading speech on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 117C of the Family Law Act provides that parties to maintenance and property proceedings in the Family Court may file and deliver offers of compromise. Offers of compromise are designed to encourage the early settlement of disputes and to dispose of proceedings without final adjudication due to the cost consequences that may flow from the rejection of a reasonable offer of compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By subsection 117C(3), the existence of an offer of compromise should not be disclosed to the court except at the conclusion of the proceedings when the court comes to consider the question of costs. Subsection (3) gives statutory expression to the rule of natural justice that a court or tribunal be free of any bias. In the event that an offer of compromise is disclosed to a judge during the course of proceedings, the rules of natural justice require that the judge, if an objection is taken by one of the parties, disqualify himself or herself from continuing to hear the proceedings. The Bill will amend section 117C by inserting a new subsection (4) to the effect that if the fact of an offer of compromise is disclosed to a judge, that judge is not disqualified from continuing to hear the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extraordinary thing is that no explanation was given by the Government about this proposed amendment for the proposed departure from the rules of natural justice. During the second reading debate on the Bill in the other place, an explanation was given for this derogation from the requirements of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanation was put forward by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate), who said that the amendment was in response to the entreaty of the Family Court judges. The Minister has given an assurance to the Parliament that the amendment will apply only where a judge becomes aware of only the fact of an offer and not the terms and conditions of the relevant offer of compromise. If a judge becomes aware of the terms and conditions of an offer, he or she will need to stand aside unless, of course, the parties do not object to the judge continuing to hear the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition is prepared to accept the amendment on the basis of the assurance given by Senator Tate, I take this opportunity to place on the record our concern with the amendment. The rules of natural justice, having been developed by our courts over the centuries in order to protect the rights of the parties, are fundamental to the administration of justice. The Parliament should always be cautious about interfering with the rights of individuals conferred by the common law. Accordingly, I would ask that the Attorney undertake to monitor closely the operation of this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to say something about the amendment that the Attorney is not happy with, an amendment put by my colleagues in another place. It was supported by the Australian Democrats. It called on the Attorney-General to provide a statement concerning the background to the leave that he has given and, in case it should operate in the future, to leave given with full pay to the Solicitor-General. I refer to the amendment moved in the other place to section 9 of the Law Officers Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members will be aware&mdash;I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in this House&mdash;the Attorney-General's decision to grant the Solicitor-General paid leave of absence and his giving consent for the Solicitor-General to engage in private practice while on that paid leave have been widely criticised in this place, in the legal profession and in the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply extraordinary that taxpayers are being called upon to subsidise the second most senior law officer of the land in his venture to supplement his very substantial income by returning to the bar. The Solicitor-General is an officer, I might add, to whom the Attorney-General may delegate all of his powers, privileges and responsibilities. What is even more extraordinary is the Attorney's refusal to account for the reasons for his decision before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do not know what is going on with this issue. It seems clear to me that taxpayers are outraged that a person of such alleged eminence in the law will be given $160,000, will have access to his offices, to government cars, to the title `Solicitor-General' and will be told, `Take this money; go on leave and earn $500,000 or $600,000 in the next year if you wish'. It really is the most extraordinary decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time I seek a reason from the Attorney as to why he has done this I am traduced for wanting to invade the man's privacy. The man's privacy! It is not his private money; it is public money. It is the money of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock); it is the Attorney's money; it is the people's money. The Solicitor-General is on the public payroll and we are entitled to an explanation as to how this fellow can just wander in, have a chat with the Attorney, and walk out with $160,000 for the next 12 months, his title, his offices, his cars and everything else, which will take it to well over a quarter of a million dollars, and then be wished well in his endeavour to make more than half a million dollars at the bar. It is almost obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People seem to think that I have some personal animosity towards the Solicitor-General. I have not. I have none at all. Members opposite keep saying to me, `What is wrong with a fellow working while he is on holidays?'. Come off the grass!  As I have said, I have a few slow horses that have been pretty bad investments, but I cannot go to the Attorney to get an extra quid and go out and earn money at the same time. I cannot get 12 months leave from this place. It really is the most extraordinary decision, one which was given within 12 months of the time when the Solicitor-General entered into a new contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am appalled at the decision, I continue to ask the Attorney: will he please give the House a reason for his decision without traducing me for raising it or telling me it is private and confidential?  It is taxpayers' money. The Solicitor-General is the second most senior law officer in the Commonwealth. He leaves to go to the bar for 12 months; he retains his title and his offices; he takes his money and is wished well. Indeed, it has been said in this place that honourable members opposite wish him well and hope that he can earn half a million dollars. It is the most extraordinary decision and, as I say, it has been widely criticised here and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers are being called upon to subsidise the Solicitor-General's venture to supplement his already substantial income. According to the Attorney, matters relating to the administration of a statutory office and the expenditure of public moneys are private matters which need not concern either the Parliament or the people. This, to put it mildly, is a quite outrageous derogation from an excellent Minister who normally comes into this House and gives full reasons for his decisions&mdash;but on this occasion, not at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Solicitor-General holds statutory office through appointment by the Attorney-General and the accountability of that office to the public must be channelled through the Attorney. The Solicitor-General is in no position to come in here and explain what has gone on; only the Attorney can do that. The responsibility of explaining the reason rests with the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney claims that he need not account to the Parliament over the matter because to do so would intrude upon the Solicitor-General's personal affairs. Incomprehensible! The committee of inquiry chaired by Sir Nigel Bowen noted at paragraph 3.51 of its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Duty and Private Interest</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not think that the right to privacy forms a complete and automatic bar to the imposition of any disclosure requirements. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, as the Full Federal Court noted in the 1984 decision in News Corporation Ltd v. National Companies and Securities Commission, which is reported in part 1 of the 1984 volume of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Federal Court Reports</EMPHASIS> at page 64, the expression `personal affairs', in the context of section 41 of the Freedom of Information Act, `clearly indicates a dichotomy between business and non-business affairs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that the Parliament seeks from the Attorney relates to the expenditure of public moneys and the administration of the affairs of a statutory office within his portfolio. That is not information of a private nature. Subsequent to raising the matter in the House on a number of occasions, I wrote to the Attorney and I requested of the Attorney, pursuant to the provisions of section 13 of what is termed the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977, that he provide me with a statement of the reasons for and the facts behind his decision in regard to the Solicitor-General and all this money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney has refused my request on the somewhat spurious ground that I do not have sufficient standing. In addition to this, I delivered three&mdash;not one, not two but three&mdash;separate requests under the Freedom of Information Act for documents in possession of the Attorney, his Department and the Solicitor-General. In response, I got a letter from a departmental officer claiming to have authority to act on behalf of the Attorney, the Solicitor-General and the Secretary to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I write, under the terms that are granted to any citizen under the Freedom of Information Act, to the Attorney, the Solicitor-General and the Department, and a public servant replies on behalf of all of them. One of the most curious aspects of the letter I received was a determination by this officer that my request&mdash;listen to this one&mdash;did not relate to a matter of public interest. This just heaps unbelievable proposition on unbelievable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating this matter because the Senate took a stance on this issue and moved an amendment to the Bill. A chamber of the Houses of the Parliament of Australia has expressed a view on this issue, clearly indicating at the very least that it is a matter of public interest, but a public servant, on the Attorney's behalf, writes to me&mdash;and it would not matter who it was; it could be any elected official&mdash;sweeps all that aside and says that he, as the judge of public interest, is telling me that this is not a matter of public interest. That is completely at odds with the view taken by a chamber of the Houses of this Parliament&mdash;the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a public servant's interpretation of public interest is allowed to override that of an elected body, namely, the Senate, then my fears are confirmed&mdash;that bureaucrats and those they represent, albeit temporarily, are making a mockery of the Freedom of Information Act. If this is not a matter of public interest, I do not know what is. The Government shovels out money to a public officer, lets him go on leave to earn as much money as he likes, we ask a question about it and we are told the matter is private. We are not going to be told the reasons. We seek information under the Freedom of Information Act and we are told it is not even a matter of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lo and behold, a chamber of the Parliament has passed a view on it. Wait until we get before the AAT on this, because we will not rest on it. I am not going to leave it here. There are various avenues open to those who have rights under the Freedom of Information Act to go beyond simply the writing and receipt of letters. But given that the information we seek cannot be obtained through the parliamentary process or by the use of maybe other means&mdash;although I will be seeking to use those other means&mdash;we have been moved to put forward an amendment to section 9 of the Law Officers Act which would require the Attorney to table in both Houses a statement of reasons and facts when giving consent for the Solicitor-General to undertake paid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Attorney is not prepared to fulfil his ministerial responsibilities and to account to Parliament, it falls on the Parliament to compel him to do so by way of legislation. The amendment to the Law Officers Act uses the same formula as that found in section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in that the Attorney is required to table written reasons, together with a statement as to his findings, on any material questions of fact.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that this formula be adopted, given that a decision by the Attorney-General under section 9 of the Law Officers Act is a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment and, therefore, prima facie amenable to judicial review. We take this opportunity to call on the Attorney-General once more&mdash;</PARA>

As a result of this amendment&mdash;which I do not necessarily object to&mdash;I have some concerns, given that there is the opportunity for the court to be made aware of the offer of compromise, that there is possibly the opportunity for some of the terms and conditions to be introduced via the back door without necessarily specifically itemising those terms and conditions. Therefore, I believe that there is still the potential for considerable compromise in respect of the judge who might be handling the particular matter. I think the Attorney needs to address that question very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I can, off the top of my head, give an example. Let us say that an offer of compromise has been filed for some $65,000. Someone giving evidence about the amount of property that he or she considers to be appropriate might be asked, `What do you believe is an appropriate figure?'. That person may say to the court, `Well, $60,000 seems reasonable to me', which is not far off what has been offered. In my view, this would obviously potentially compromise the judge in charge of the case. Although there is no specific reference to the terms and conditions of the offer of compromise, in a de facto way evidence has been led that will indicate roughly the terms and conditions of the offer of compromise. I really believe that the Attorney needs to have a closer look at that. I note that his advisers are with him tonight. I would be quite happy to have an input into the problems that I see in regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I support the thrust of that amendment. Quite frankly, I believe that it has the potential to limit significantly not only individual costs but, potentially, the costs of the Legal Aid Commission. Mr Speaker, as you would well know, the Commission needs every red cent it can get its hands on at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions under section 60H(1) and the other matters in relation to custody, guardianship, et cetera, make a lot of sense. I support those provisions. I think it is fair to say that the Family Law Act, which was introduced in 1975, potentially cleared the way for a more rational application of family law in this country. I, for one, would hate to go back to the days when people jumped through windows to take photographs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have concerns about the Act as it currently operates. I have very great concerns about the question of child maintenance. I believe the Child Support Agency, and the legislation under which it operates, is creating a very significant division throughout the community. From my experience, and as you, Mr Speaker, would be well aware, the crisis in any marriage is not so much the act of separation but the act of division of property. It is the act of working out the level of maintenance and, in the end, of ascertaining who will and who will not retain custody of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Act in some ways addresses those concerns, but it has become an extremely divisive parliamentary weapon, a legislative weapon. I can assure you, Mr Speaker&mdash;and I am sure it is the same for a lot of other members in this House&mdash;that a great proportion of the people who come through our doors are there to see us about the Child Support Act and about complaints with the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the inquiry that is presently taking place will address some of those concerns, but I do not believe that the inquiry is far reaching enough. It should have been far more far reaching. We need to address those potential divisions coming in to the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extraordinary part&mdash;but maybe it is not extraordinary&mdash;is that those of my colleagues still practising in the family law area tell me that over the past 18 months applications have dropped off significantly. That obviously results from a combination of factors, but the recession appears to have had a considerable effect on the willingness or otherwise of people to separate. Whether that is related to the price of property or to the ability of non-custodial parents to pay sufficient maintenance is anyone's guess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, although the number of people taking the option of separation may have stopped for a certain amount of time, an extremely difficult period for Australian families has also been created in the Australian community. They are under enormous pressure at the moment. They are under enormous financial pressures, and I believe that in the long run we may well again see an upsurge in the number of people choosing the option of separation, but it will be related to nothing but financial disability which has led to the breakdown of the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In half an hour or so, or by tomorrow morning, we will have a new Prime Minister. While I pay tribute to the outgoing Prime Minister, I can assure honourable members that I pay absolutely no tribute to the incoming Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) because of the ramifications of his policies on Australian families and on the people affected by the Family Law Act. Obviously, we are just seeing the start of the problems. The honourable member for Blaxland is carrying around his neck the noose of one million people unemployed and of quite considerable family breakdown and the enormously detrimental impact on family life in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will deal with some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the shadow Attorney, and then those raised by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). The shadow Attorney indicated, correctly&mdash;the honourable member for Ballarat also touched on this&mdash;that we will not be pursuing the amendment in respect of the Judiciary Act, for the reasons stated. The matters of concern expressed in respect of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act no longer exist. The other issue raised by the honourable member for Kooyong related to section 117C of the Family Law Act relating to the assurance that was given on this matter by Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, when this matter was debated in the other place. I reiterate that assurance and go just a little further than that in the sense that, if there are difficulties with this amendment, as indicated by my colleague in the Senate when the matter was debated there, we will monitor it very closely. Further, if there are difficulties, they can be dealt with the next time there is an opportunity for amendments to the Family Law Act which, as both honourable members will be more than well aware, arise somewhat frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go to a matter which concerns those opposite and which has become the magnificent obsession of the honourable member for Kooyong over the last few months or weeks. That is the question of the leave of the Solicitor-General and his right to private practice whilst on leave. Before moving to that, I should indicate that in committee I will be moving the amendment which has been circulated in my name. However, in the circumstances this evening I would prefer to touch on those matters now and, if they are raised again in committee, I will respond then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, from memory, three Question Times have concentrated on this matter and we have had a censure motion in respect of it. The shadow Attorney has indicated some very strong views about it. Tonight he added a couple, saying that he does not know what is going on and that he needs more access to information.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should not respond to interjections, but the shadow Attorney wanted to know whether the Solicitor-General felt he was chasing him. I really do not know that I would waste a great deal of the time spent with the Solicitor-General in dealing with matters of importance to this Government by requesting him to indicate his views on what the shadow Attorney was doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few points have to be made about this matter. Generally, as the shadow Attorney knows after almost an eternity in this place, Ministers have discretion as to what information they provide to Parliament, for example, in responding in Question Time. In exercising that discretion on what to provide to Parliament, Ministers can take into account various factors. In my view, all the relevant circumstances should be taken into account in determining whether and to what extent Ministers provide information on reasons for a decision. Although, of course, when Ministers are disclosing information, they are not required to act consistently with the provisions in the Privacy Act relating to the disclosure of personal information&mdash;for example, privacy principle 11&mdash;the existence of this discretion permits them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present&mdash;and I think it is a point that has been overlooked for a long time&mdash;when an Attorney-General gives consent under section 10 of the Law Officers Act, there is a discretion not to disclose reasons for exercising that discretion. An Attorney-General may disclose reasons, but in choosing to do so, I suggest, any Attorney-General should weigh up a number of factors. Those factors are matters relating to the effect on the privacy of the individual concerned, taking into account the issue which the shadow Attorney has raised on many occasions, and balancing that with the public interest in making the disclosure. I accept that, and that is what I did. It is my view that, balancing those two things, the reasons should not be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provision, which was inserted in the Senate, would remove that discretion from any Minister in this Parliament in the future. The privacy safeguards that I referred to would disappear. We would then move into the area of compulsion. In this instance, an Attorney-General would be compelled to disclose, regardless of the circumstances of a particular case, and the provision would prevent that balancing of the public interest and private interest before making a disclosure of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a lack of privacy protection is absolutely at variance with the policy of other legislation where the disclosure of personal information is in issue. For example, under the Freedom of Information Act, a document is exempt from disclosure&mdash;it is well known to those opposite&mdash;if disclosure would involve an unreasonable disclosure of the personal affairs of any person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot be persuaded that there is a difference in this case. I go back to where, in a sense, this whole argument started. The reasons for granting approval of the Solicitor-General's application to engage in private practice were simply these&mdash;and I have given them before. He wished to engage in private practice and it was possible, after discussions with the Solicitor-General, to agree to that request on the basis that there would be no conflict between Dr Griffith's private practice and his office of Solicitor-General. There was no other reason to refuse approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the question of intrusion on the affairs of a person&mdash;that is, the personal affairs, in this case, of the Solicitor-General. The Opposition's amendment has a retrospective operation in relation to Dr Gavan Griffith, QC. Senator Hill has said in the Senate that the retrospective application of the provision is not to elicit personal information which might be relevant to the approval being given to Dr Griffith to engage in private practice in 1992. To some extent, I can understand Senator Hill saying that. It was not his matter. It was my matter, on behalf of the Government, and the matter of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we analyse Senator Hill's statement, it is quite an extraordinary statement. He says the purpose of the amendment was not to elicit personal information which might be relevant to the approval given to Dr Griffith. It is very difficult to see any other purpose in retrospective application of this provision. If the Opposition is moving to a stage of really gilding the lily, this is the classic case&mdash;getting up and saying, `It is not even in the future that we are going to change the terms and conditions of the employment of the Solicitor-General and require disclosure in this type of case; we are going to do it retrospectively. But that is not going to be used to elicit information which might be relevant to the approval given to Dr Griffith'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what was said in the other place. We in this place all gave up believing in fairy stories a long while ago. If people can believe that, they can believe anything. I think it may well be that it was not fully understood when the matter was looked at in the Senate. I think that in touching on what was said in the Senate one has to come back to the exact wording. Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not wish to intrude unduly upon the personal affairs of this particular officer or any other officers. . . There may well be ways in which he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Attorney-General&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can meet the obligation that we seek to apply without unduly intruding upon the personal affairs of the law officer concerned. That is not our wish; we do not seek that. What we do wish is that Ministers be properly accountable to the Parliament for expenditure of public moneys, particularly in most unusual circumstances. We regard this as a most unusual circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA>That was reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 26 November 1991 at page 3389. I repeat the words of Senator Hill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not wish to intrude unduly upon the personal affairs of this particular officer or any other officers.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we are told that this suggested amendment should be retrospective. It may be that from time to time we do become obsessed about odd things. It has happened to me on very rare occasions; it is happening more regularly to the shadow Attorney-General. I think that this one has got out of hand. If, as said by someone of the enormous significance of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, there is no wish to intrude unduly upon the personal affairs of this particular officer or any other officers, what are those opposite on about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the retrospective nature of this legislation, we have all talked about the significance that has to be in a matter before we get into retrospectivity. This is not a fishing expedition for the Opposition or any of its members. In respect of the comments made this evening by the honourable member for Kooyong, the Solicitor-General's annual salary is just under $140,000, not $160,000 as was said earlier tonight. He will have just short of nine months paid leave&mdash;and I think this again is the interesting factor which is perpetually overlooked&mdash;that is, leave that he is entitled to and entitled to be paid for. Unpaid leave is from 2 September to 20 December. The value of the paid leave is of the order of $100,000. As I have said in this place before, if someone in those circumstances says that he is going to engage in practice during that period and I am satisfied, as I have been, that I could agree to that request on the basis that there would be no conflict between Dr Griffith's private practice and his office of Solicitor-General, I find it very difficult, and have found it so for a long time, to know why the honourable member for Kooyong wishes to pursue this matter with vigour&mdash;somewhat erratic vigour at times, but with an enormous amount of vigour. I will be accused of being unnecessarily provocative about that. He says that every time I come in here I attack him on this issue. I am not attacking him; I am just a bit worried about him at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Solicitor-General&mdash;and I confirm it again&mdash;has an entitlement to paid leave. Nobody disputes that, not even the honourable member for Kooyong. The Solicitor-General has asked to take that leave and I have agreed to it. He is entitled to that payment for nine months, which is an accrued right that he has. He is entitled to it in 1992. Whether he went fishing or back to legal practice in that period, he is entitled to that leave. The question then became: should he be allowed to practise as a barrister at that time? And he asked for that. I have agreed, as I said, on the basis of no conflict being allowed to develop between his private practice and that of the office. It is not a matter for me or any Attorney-General, I would suggest, in the future, or anyone in this place, how often the Solicitor-General exercises that right of private practice. It is not a matter for me and it is certainly not a matter for the Opposition. He may exercise it a lot or he may not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney has an enormously exaggerated view of the capacity of people to go back to the bar for a short period&mdash;he may prove to be right; I hope he is&mdash;and earn enormous amounts of money. He is always talking about sums of $500,000 or more, depending on his mood from time to time, but it is a question that has to be addressed on the basis of the public interest being protected by the conditions that are granted for private practice to ensure that the office of the Solicitor-General is not subject to any conflict. In my view, that is probably the only relevant matter, despite all the rhetoric that from time to time the honourable member for Kooyong has gone on with and has then, of course, forced me into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the debate in the Senate on this matter because it really did go to the essence of what is now suggested. Debates in the Senate, of course, go a lot longer, but in many ways the debate did get to the real essence of the matter. As was said in that House by Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to enact this particular clause so that it becomes part of the Law Officers Act would be to retrospectively alter the statutory conditions under which the office of the Solicitor-General was conferred on a particular person.</PARA>
<PARA>I went to that earlier. By trying to draft the process of the ADJR Act into this situation, the Opposition has potentially created a grave invasion of the privacy of the holder of the office. That would not be permitted under the ADJR Act. Under that Act, of course, an aggrieved person cannot be given reasons where the giving of those reasons would impinge on the personal affairs of a third party; and, for reasons that totally escape me, that is what the Opposition is attempting to do here. The shadow Attorney has made an application knowing that the Act would not be applicable, because he is not an aggrieved person. That is a matter that I must not say a great deal about, because I understand that that and other matters, such as freedom of information, will be taken further by the shadow Attorney. That is of course his right&mdash;and the very best of luck to him. He will proceed with that&mdash;</PARA>

As honourable members know, I am very interested in these amendments, and anything to do with the Family Law Act, particularly as it affects families. The Attorney-General knows that prior to the Budget every year I express deep concern about family matters. Whilst we have amendments to the Family Law Act before us with regard to State child welfare organisations and their references to the Family Court, together with an amendment which refers to a Family Court judge not being disqualified from hearing a case where an offer of compromise, et cetera, has been made in a property dispute, I express on behalf of the majority of Australians, I believe, deep concern at the fact that we are always year after year putting the cart before the horse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are spending enormous, voluminous amounts of taxpayers' money propping up families because of marriage failure or family breakdown. In fact, in 1974&mdash;the Family Law Act was introduced in 1975&mdash;the cost to the taxpayer was a mere $40m. The Family Law Act has many good aspects and a number of very negative aspects, as it has turned out. By 1982 the cost to the taxpayer was $800m. I know the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has heard me say this a number of times at the inquiry being undertaken into the Family Law Act and related services. In the 1991-92 Budget, the bill to the taxpayer, as a result of family breakdown, now amounts to just under $3,000m. I find that absolutely horrendous. It ought to concern this Parliament, but we seem to go on day after day totally unconcerned about the fact that the main areas of stability in any society, strong families and happy marriages, are receiving no attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in 1985, the amount of money being allocated to marriage education in this country nationally was 25c per year per family; that is just unacceptable. We are paying out $500 and $600 per year per family to prop up families as a result of marriage breakdown. If that is not putting the cart before the horse, what is? The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) needs to pay a lot more attention to this, as does the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). We have a situation in this country where&mdash;and it does not matter how good the new Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), will be or how good new economic packages are&mdash;if we do not have strong, stable families and a certain degree of moral fibre in our nation, we will go down the gurgler one day or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to express my very deep concern about the fact that we are continually putting the cart before the horse. Here we are spending just under $3,000m propping up families as a result of family breakdown, and a mere $16m on marriage counselling and a mere $500,000 on marriage education. Research and statistics show us that 75 per cent of marriages fail because of benign neglect, not because of malicious intent. They show that prior to marriage only 6 per cent of young people seek any kind of education with regard to making their marriages work. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never in 26 years in this Parliament struck this as a precedent where a public servant can take his money, and go and work at something else like this, and I want an explanation for it. The Attorney has refused to give me an explanation saying, `It is private'. He says that, even though it is public money. He says, `It is personal and private and you are not going to be told why this money has been made available to the Solicitor-General. It is a very personal matter'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that my colleagues in the Senate, with the support of the Democrats, brought about require the Attorney to give a statement to the Parliament in writing as to the reasons he gives this amount of money and leave in the circumstances. I think that is pretty reasonable. But now it has come down to the House, all we are asking for is a statement in writing that relates to the granting of the consent that he gave that refers to the evidence and other material. We are asking for the reasons to be given. We even said that we would compromise as to the nature of that statement, but that it would have to apply retrospectively. The Attorney thinks it is unfair for it to be retrospective. Unless we make it retrospective, we will not get an explanation with regard to the current Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not like retrospective law normally, and those on this side of the chamber generally oppose retrospective laws where they impose a different duty on individuals and taxpayers. It would be ludicrous, for example, if we said that from last week any person who went through a green light would be committing an offence or if we retrospectively amended tax laws and the like. This proposal does not do that. This is a different form of retrospectivity. It is saying, in terms of months, this Attorney-General, as a Minister of the Crown, has an obligation to explain why these public moneys are being paid out. He ought to meet that obligation. We are prepared to put an amendment to ensure that he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber have a general policy against the enactment of retrospective legislation where it takes away a benefit or imposes obligations on private persons. That is one thing, but this amendment seeks to amend section 9 of the Law Officers Act. It does not fall foul of the general prohibition in that it imposes an obligation on a public figure, namely, a Minister of the Crown, the Attorney-General. In addition, the amendment does not take away any benefit. What is normally odious about retrospective legislation is that we can enact it and take away a benefit a person hitherto thought he had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This confers a benefit on the taxpaying community by calling on a Minister of the Crown to account to the Parliament for the administration of a statutory office and the expenditure of public moneys. All we are saying, in essence, is that we want the Minister to fulfil his obligations and account to the Parliament by outlining the reasons for allowing the Solicitor-General to keep his title and practice at the bar, but not do any more work for the Commonwealth and still get all his money for the whole of 1992 while he earns an estimated $500,000 or $600,000 in private practice. I regard it as obnoxious that it has even been done. It is compounded by the fact that we are not even told why. That goes on and on in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sent applications under the Freedom of Information Act and I will pursue them through to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if necessary. I simply want to know why, because I know that no-one in this place could get that sort of deal&mdash;nor should they. I do not want to know all the personal affairs of the Solicitor-General. I read in the paper that he has made some bad investments and he wants to make some more money. There are a lot of people out there who do not even have any money to make any investments, and there are a lot of people out there who cannot even get a job. But in this case not only is a man allowed to keep his job; he does not have to do any work in that job. It is not leave without pay, and it is an incredible sum of money. On top of that, the Attorney publicly wishes him well in earning in excess of half a million dollars. I do not know whether there is a different mentality in this world today, but I do not comprehend it. All I wanted was an explanation and all we have done in the Senate is seek that explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The element of retrospectivity does not take away any benefit. It simply says, `This applies because some months ago you did this'. I know I will not get an answer from the Attorney in here and I will have to go further. It has been a difficult day for the Attorney; a day on which he honourably stood with his leader and lost in a battle a couple of hours ago. I will not dwell on that, but it has been a very difficult day for him because he has invested a great deal of time, emotion and loyalty in support of his Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I ask him whether at the conclusion of this debate he will please change his mind and at last account to the public why he is treating the Solicitor-General so favourably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had an indication that we had better finish the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) fairly quickly. I want to touch again on a few of the matters raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), because every time he says something on this subject the obsession gets deeper and deeper. He is now telling us that the Solicitor-General does not have to work while he is on leave in order to receive payment. No, he does not have to work while he is on leave to receive payment for his leave because it is accrued leave that he is entitled to. I have said that over and over again. He is entitled to paid leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney keeps saying that the Solicitor-General is being paid while he is not doing anything. That is a matter for the Solicitor-General. If we go on leave and we are entitled to leave and entitled to payment and we do not do anything, of course we are going to get paid. That is what the leave is all about. The difference here is that the Solicitor-General has made a decision that that was not what he wanted to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of retrospectivity, the shadow Attorney referred again to the fact that he does not want to intrude on people's privacy. There is a terrible conflict here between what he says and what was said by his leader in the Senate: he does not wish to intrude unduly upon the personal affairs of this officer. I am afraid that if, for reasons which escape me, the shadow Attorney does want to find out personal information about someone which in my view he is not entitled to, and he proposes to pursue that through the legal processes available to him in this country, that is his right. I have told him before that it is none of his business. That was my position weeks ago and it is still my position. Should another decision be taken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, good luck to the shadow Attorney-General. I have told him over and over again. His interest has become obsessive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth reports of the Committee for 1991, which relate to stage 3 of the development of RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory; CSIRO redevelopment, Parkville, Victoria; relocation of Naval Support Command Headquarters, Pyrmont, New South Wales; and the Special Broadcasting Service, relocation of radio and television, Artarmon, New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report that I have presented relates to the third stage of the development of RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Stages 1 and 2 of the development were the subject of previous reports by the Committee in 1984 and 1987. The development of RAAF Base Tindal over the past seven years represents one of the largest and most expensive defence infrastructure developments in Australia's history. What in 1984 was a bare base located in a remote area with a harsh climate has been transformed into a modern air force base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious to the Committee during the inspection of the base that the RAAF personnel are proud of what has been achieved. Stage 3 will involve the provision of air defence facilities, living-in accommodation, deployed squadron operational and technical facilities, aircraft pavements, aircraft shelters and associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $53.5m at April 1991 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the works comprising stage 3 should proceed. Facilities for the use of aircraft deployed to Tindal are required because existing operational and support facilities which were essentially provided for No. 75 Squadron are inadequate. Therefore, the Committee concluded that if it is intended to continue the deployment of fighter and strike aircraft at Tindal, adequate facilities must be provided for them. Similarly, additional aircraft pavements are required to realise the full potential of the master- planned coat-hanger runway and taxi configuration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also concluded that now is a good time for the relocation of No. 2 control and reporting unit from Darwin to Tindal. Facilities in Darwin are inadequate to house replacement equipment which it has been proposed to acquire. There would be strategic and operational advantages as well as financial benefits if the unit were located at Tindal and for the relocation to coincide with the delivery of replacement equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to mention two matters which generated some local interest at the Committee's public hearing into the proposal. Firstly, a number of witnesses suggested that the scope of stage 3 development should be extended by the inclusion of a bicycle track from Katherine to Tindal. Some RAAF personnel cycle along the Stuart Highway, a practice which is potentially dangerous because of the heavy traffic. The Committee concluded that a bike track could be constructed linking east Katherine with Tindal, with the Northern Territory Government and Katherine Town Council meeting the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter concerns the need for an independent analysis of the drainage pattern of the Tindal-Katherine area. The Katherine Town Council submitted to the Committee that unusually heavy flooding of the eastern side of Katherine had occurred during the 1990-91 wet season. The Council believes that this flooding may be the result of the development of Tindal. The Committee has recommended that an independent analysis of the drainage pattern of the Tindal-Katherine area should be undertaken to identify factors contributing to flooding and to recommend realistic measures to minimise it. The analysis should be funded by the Commonwealth Government, the Territory Government and Katherine Town Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report I have tabled relates to the redevelopment of CSIRO facilities at Parkville, Victoria. CSIRO is proposing to redevelop its Parkville site as a major research complex and to provide the headquarters for the Division of Biomolecular Engineering. The redevelopment will provide facilities for 140 staff and work will be undertaken in three stages so that the site remains operational at all times. The Committee has recommended that the work proceed at a cost of $12.25m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1990, the mission of the Division of Biomolecular Engineering was changed to concentrate on assisting the development of the Australian pharmaceutical and health care industries. The change in direction away from wool technology and agricultural protein research will have a major impact on the nature of laboratory accommodation required by the Division. CSIRO advised the Committee that the existing laboratories require urgent upgrading to provide facilities suitable for sophisticated computer based instrumentation and micro-analytical techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued operation by CSIRO of the site at 343 Royal Parade, Parkville, was strongly opposed by the Parkville Association. The Association fundamentally believes that the location in North Parkville of such a facility is inappropriate, because North Parkville is an area which the Association regards as being predominantly residential and having high environmental sensitivity. The view of the Parkville Association was supported by the Melbourne City Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee appreciates the wish of the Parkville Association and the Melbourne City Council to retain the predominantly residential nature of Parkville, the fact is that CSIRO has been established on the Parkville site in accordance with local planning regulations since 1952. The Committee accepts the view of CSIRO, which was supported by other research institutions, that the Parkville location of the Division of Biomolecular Engineering is vital to its research program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that the works proceed, the Committee has recommended that CSIRO should provide it with a comprehensive report detailing the energy management systems and energy conservation measures to be incorporated in the Parkville development. Concern was expressed at the public hearing by the Commonwealth Fire Board and the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade regarding the effects of the immunity of the Crown from State building regulations, particularly in relation to fire safety. The Committee is still considering the wider implication of this issue and will report to the Parliament shortly. However, at this stage the Committee has recommended that consultation with local fire authorities should be undertaken prior to the referral of all projects to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report relates to the relocation of Naval Support Command Headquarters from the Remington Centre in the Sydney CBD to two former naval warehouses at the Royal Edward Victualling Yard, Pyrmont. The proposal is to refurbish the historic warehouses to provide office accommodation. The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed at an estimated cost of $13.34m at April 1991 prices. The Committee concluded that accommodation occupied by the Support Command in the city is inadequate and very costly at an annual rental of $4.7m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed relocation and refurbishment appeared to the Committee to be the best option examined in terms of capital cost and recurrent expenditure. Indeed, the Committee concluded that the refurbishment offers the Commonwealth the opportunity to capitalise on an existing asset and, at the same time, provide the Support Command with accommodation in an area with a maritime flavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two buildings to be refurbished are listed on the Register of the National Estate. The Committee concluded that, provided the recommendations of the conservation and management plan and of the Australian Heritage Commission are adhered to, the refurbished buildings will maintain an important part of Sydney's maritime heritage as well as providing modern office accommodation for the personnel of the Support Command Headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also concluded that the proposal represents an ideal opportunity for the inclusion of a state of the art building services system designed to exceed current energy targets, and for the provision of a building services monitoring system capable of sensing and rectifying air quality as well as temperatures. The proposal is the first occasion in which the Department of Defence has not used Australian Construction Services as its design and construction authority. Instead, Defence will call tenders for a number of contractors to design, execute and supervise construction. Given this change, the Committee has recommended that it be provided with six-monthly reports on the achievement of major milestones in the design and construction of the proposal and the level of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last of the four reports that I am tabling this evening relates to the relocation of SBS radio and television to premises in Artarmon, New South Wales. The SBS plans to relocate radio station 2EA at Bondi Junction and SBS television at Milsons Point to an existing building in Artarmon. The proposal that the SBS put to the Public Works Committee was for the renovation of an office-warehouse complex for the use of the SBS at a cost of $14.5m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the SBS to have new premises. Its present premises are too small for its requirements, and its television service is constrained by the grossly inadequate studio space which is available to it. The SBS carried out an extensive search for new premises before choosing the Artarmon site. It found that a new, purpose-built building was beyond its means and opted to adapt an existing building to its requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building in Artarmon will provide the SBS with the space that it needs and, most importantly, with the scope to adapt part of the warehouse in the complex as studios to industry standards. This will allow the SBS, for the first time since it was established in 1978, to extend its television current affairs coverage to panel discussions with more than three participants and with the possibility of having an audience. It will also provide the SBS with the means of making its own productions. With these facilities, the SBS will be better placed than it is at present to serve Australia's multicultural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was expressed to the Committee about the choice of Artarmon as the location for the SBS's new premises. On balance, however, the Committee believes that the location is a suitable one. It is a cheaper location than the central business district, it is near other television stations and associated services, public transport makes it readily accessible for staff and contributors, and it will prove to be an asset. Furthermore, the building is larger than the SBS needs. The SBS plans to lease out the excess space and use the revenue gained to help finance local productions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee is recommending that Commonwealth funds be spent on the refurbishment of the office-warehouse complex at 14 Herbert Street, Artarmon, to provide accommodation for the SBS radio, television and corporate services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making this recommendation, the Committee was concerned about the very tight time frame for the refurbishment and the use of fast-track methods of construction. We know that fast-track construction tends to be more expensive than normal methods. If a tight time-frame for the project slips, the SBS will encounter additional costs. Because of these concerns, the Committee has recommended  that the SBS report to it every three months on how well the project is keeping to its program and budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will mention that the Committee also made recommendations about energy conservation, parking and transport for shift workers and the provision of child-care. In addition, the Committee urges the SBS to undertake more comprehensive consultation with the unions than it has undertaken hitherto. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I  commend the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for its report and certainly support the relocation of SBS from its present substandard premises. However, the site SBS is moving to contains a five-storey car park. I believe that it is an outrageous use of taxpayers' money to fund such a car park, which is worth several million dollars, and convert the whole work force of SBS from public transport to private transport. It is not only outrageous but also an unfair use of public funds. It is totally contrary to all public policy, especially as it is in the centre of Australia's largest city.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) with his mantra about stopping urban sprawl. To convert a whole work force involving several hundred people to the use of private cars in an area that is already very much subject to traffic congestion and pollution will obviously exacerbate the sprawl and involve hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure spending. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said, this site is one of the best served in Australia by public transport facilities. There are buses and trains within a five-minute walk of the site. I do not believe that any argument can justify public expenditure on a five-storey car park for a staff of some hundreds. We are simply pandering to the selfishness of Commonwealth employees, particularly when it is so detrimental to the area. In those circumstances it should be recommended that SBS be directed to sell that car park by public tender. It could then be utilised by anyone who wants to use it and by the rest of the community. </PARA>

I think that the Committee puts a lot of time and effort into its references. I too want to make one brief comment about the SBS relocation. I commented on this matter a month or two ago in this chamber. I am concerned that SBS seems to be getting into the empire building operation. As was pointed out by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), this complex is larger than current needs dictate, which does make one wonder about the future plans for SBS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of fast-track construction also concerns me because I believe that SBS on its current site has a lease that will run until 1995. Therefore, I would have thought that there is no urgency to warrant getting into fast-track construction. Nonetheless, I also voice my concern as to whether the size of the current SBS operation is fully justified. Finally, I wonder whether we will ever see a time when the Public Works Committee knocks something back and says, `Hang on, is there an alternative?'. I am sure that the Committee does look at these things very thoroughly and I will take its guidance. </PARA>

<PARA>To ensure the preservation of permanent value records the Australian Archives maintains purpose built repositories in all regions except Victoria. The Melbourne accommodation is located in two principal sites: Brighton for permanent records and Dandenong for the records of temporary value. The Brighton site is currently owned by the Commonwealth, while the Dandenong site is leased. The Brighton accommodation is extremely dilapidated, suffering from rising damp, salt and water penetration and floors which are breaking up. These poor conditions have led to one building having to cease being used for record storage. This, together with the general deterioration of paper records at Brighton, indicates that the higher than average temperatures within the repository are increasing the rate of decomposition. If the records continue to be exposed to the degrading influences of this environment, it will only serve to compound the problem for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed facility will rectify these problems by providing up-to-date, climate controlled secure storage facilities for permanent value Commonwealth records. It will consist of three main elements, including record storage, office accommodation and conservation.

<PARA>The international terminal building was opened in 1970 and met all the then relevant codes. Since that time the building has been modified in a number of areas to ensure public safety is not compromised. Airport terminal buildings are not expressly covered by codes, but they need to have appropriate protection. A number of reports have recommended the installation of fire sprinklers to provide safety for the occupants of the building, to protect the property as well as other improvements to provide smoke isolation and an emergency evacuation system and additional fire exits. </PARA>

Smoke isolation measures were also installed on existing stairwells and escalators. The Corporation later proceeded with further extensions to provide a new 70,000 square metre terminal and concourse at a cost of $272m.

<PARA>This stage of the development will involve the provision of air defence facilities comprising the sector operations centre and No. 2 Control and Reporting Unit headquarters, accommodation associated with projected personnel increases stemming from the air defence facilities, deployed squadron operational and technical facilities, aircraft pavements, aircraft shelters and associated engineering services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the Public Works Committee agreed to the stage 3 development of the RAAF base, Tindal, Northern Territory, subject to the implementation of the following recommendations: that Defence should liaise with the Defence Housing Authority to ensure that sufficient numbers of houses are available at Tindal or in Katherine for personnel when the planned population of the base is achieved; and that Defence maintains continuous liaison with the Defence Housing Authority to develop forecasts for changes to married quarter requirements. This process will include RAAF's perceived personnel increases from the stage 3 development as well as other influencing factors. </PARA>

<PARA>The work will involve the internal and external refurbishment of two substantial buildings together with the removal of a vehicle garage, relocation of an electrical substation, and the construction of a special purpose workshop facility for use by the underwater systems division of the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation, DSTO.

<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled and which are now being circulated to honourable members relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 12 (1991) will operate on and from 1 January 1992. Proposal No. 12 contains the following alterations: the implementation of the Government's decision to take economic measures against Yugoslavia; redefinition of the upper weight limit for light commercial vehicles; changes to item 36B in schedule four as a consequence of Customs Cooperation Council nomenclature changes and current phasing rates; and the introduction of a new item in schedule four to maintain current duty rates for orthopaedic appliances following changes to the harmonised nomenclature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the serious situation in Yugoslavia, the European Community, which has taken a leading role in trying to mediate between the parties, announced a series of economic measures against Yugoslavia, including the withdrawal of Yugoslavia's access to the European Community's generalised system of preferences. Australia and a number of other countries decided to take supportive measures. Accordingly, Yugoslavia will be taken off the list of countries which benefit from the Australian system of tariff preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Community also decided that those of Yugoslavia's six republics which cooperate with the European Community's peace efforts would be exempted from the measures taken against Yugoslavia, and the Australian Government decided to adopt the same distinction. Accordingly, the republics of Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia will be listed among those places which are eligible under the Australian system of tariff preferences. The business community has put on notice that these actions were to be taken in a press statement on 13 November 1991 by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The date of effect of these changes will be 1 January 1992 so as not to disadvantage importers of goods on the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing arrangements, light commercial vehicles have an upper limit of 2.72 tonnes gross vehicle weight. This limit is now being widely replaced by the European standard, which has an upper limit of 3.5 tonnes. The European standard is currently in use in Australian design rules for vehicles and is also used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The changes in this proposal arise from new automotive arrangements announced in the Government's March industry statement and bring the Customs tariff into line with current practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of amendments to the harmonised nomenclature by the Customs Cooperation Council, two changes are being made to schedule four: the table to item 36B is being altered to reflect a change in schedule three and to remove references to classifications which become duty free on 1 January; and new item 40G is being introduced to maintain the current free rate of duty for orthopaedic goods of textile material which are currently classified in chapter 90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs Tariff Proposal No. 13 will operate on and from 1 March 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have been made in the context of the post-1988 assistance arrangements for textiles, clothing and footwear industries based on the premium tender rates for the 1992 quota period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of aspects. The Bill will implement the changes initially announced in the March industry statement to taxation depreciation arrangements. Following consultations with business and professionals, further details of the changes to depreciation were announced on 26 September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces amendments to prevent avoidance of tax under various provisions which authorise tax deductions for capital expenditure incurred in income producing activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment provides for a deferral&mdash;or `roll-over'&mdash;of balancing adjustments that may arise on the disposal of property to which the various capital allowance rules have applied; for example, plant depreciation or the various capital allowances for mining property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will provide a company that is the beneficial owner of shares held by a trustee or partnership, with a rebate for its share of net income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividends paid on those shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also bolster the trading stock provisions of the law by ensuring that tax deductions under section 51 for buying trading stock are not allowed until the stock is on hand. This will remedy a weakness exposed in a recent Federal Court case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will also amend the tax law to streamline the tax file number arrangements. The capital gains tax roll-over provisions for transfers of partnership assets to wholly-owned companies are also to be amended to correct a technical deficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other minor amendments to be given effect by this Bill relate to foreign source income measures; foreign exchange gains and losses, the rehabilitation of mining, quarrying and petroleum sites; the research and development provisions; substantiation; and the taxation of education entry payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical or procedural amendments of the tax laws.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Depreciation amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will implement a number of announced changes to depreciation arrangements. For the first time, a definition of effective life will be inserted into the income tax law. Broadly, effective life will be defined as the period during which an item of plant can reasonably be expected to be used for income producing purposes by any person.This definition will facilitate the matching of depreciation deductions to the income generated by the item of plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new effective life definition will apply to assets acquired on or after 1 July 1991. However, following representations from business groups, assets acquired after 12 March 1991 will be eligible for the new effective life rules from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with self-assessment principles, taxpayers will be able to estimate the rate of depreciation at the time an item of plant is first used, or installed ready for use, for income producing purposes. This estimate will be based on an objective view of effective life having regard to the statutory definition. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation will continue to publish advisory depreciation rates that taxpayers not wishing to make independent estimates may adopt for convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also give effect to several simplification initiatives. The number of depreciation rates will be reduced from 18 to seven broad-banded rate classes, effective from the 1991-92 income year. All assets eligible for broadbanding, excluding motor vehicles, will receive loading at the rate of 20 per cent. For assets acquired on or after 1 July 1991, 100 per cent depreciation will be allowable where the value of the unit of plant does not exceed $300 or the estimated effective life of the item is less than three years. This will reduce the large accounting task associated with small items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also with effect from the 1991-92 income year, taxpayers will be able to pool items within a rate class for further administrative simplicity. The estimated cost of broadbanding and 100 per cent depreciation is $100m in 1992-93, with a declining cost in later years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anti-avoidance Measures&mdash;Deduction  Recoupment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will correct a technical deficiency in certain provisions which provide tax deductions for capital expenditure incurred in income producing activities, for example, plant depreciation allowances and allowable capital expenditure in mining operations. The amendments will prevent avoidance of tax on recoupments of previously allowed capital deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A common feature of the capital allowance provisions is that taxpayers are required to bring to account as income amounts received on the disposal of property that represent a recovery of deductions previously allowed. For example, under the plant depreciation rules, an assessable recoupment of deduction occurs when the disposal proceeds of an asset exceed its depreciated value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances, the existing law allows taxpayers to nominate as the selling price of an asset the lesser of its market value and its tax written down value. This rule can result in tax avoidance where an asset with a high market value and a low written down value is disposed of by a taxpayer to a related entity at the lower value. If the related entity then sells the property at its true market value, the proceeds cannot be treated as a recoupment of the previous owner's deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remedy the situation, the various capital allowance recoupment rules are being amended to treat disposals of relevant property under non-arm's length arrangements, or under arrangements that involve some continuity of ownership of the property, as occurring at market value. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Balancing Adjustment Roll-over Relief</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill gives effect to the then Treasurer's announcement of 8 December 1990 that wholly owned group companies could elect to defer capital allowance balancing adjustments that would otherwise apply to intra-company group asset transfers occurring after 6 December 1990 where capital gains tax roll-over relief applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A variant from the announcement is that, in respect of intra-group disposals occurring after today, capital allowance balancing adjustment roll-over relief will apply automatically whenever capital gains tax roll-over relief is obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also decided to extend capital allowance balancing adjustment roll-over relief to the following kinds of asset disposals where capital gains tax roll-over relief is obtained:</PARA>
<PARA>.a disposal of an asset by an individual or trustee to a wholly owned company;</PARA>
<PARA>.a disposal of partnership property to a company which is wholly owned by the partners; and</PARA>
<PARA>.a transfer of an asset to a spouse as the result of a marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA>An optional form of balancing adjustment roll-over relief will also be available for disposals of property which are taken to occur as the result of a part change in ownership of property, for example, as can occur when the membership of a partnership is varied. This will enable owners of property to avoid being unnecessarily taxed on amounts that relate to a share of property which they continue to own. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend Rebates: Company Beneficiaries and Partners</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will extend the scope of the inter- company dividend rebate to allow the rebate to companies that are not shareholders. The proposed amendment will overcome the effect of the High Court decision in the Patcorp case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this decision was that only the registered shareholder was entitled to the inter-company dividend rebate. Even though a company was absolutely entitled to the shares as against the trustee and was taxed on the dividend as trust income, it was not entitled to the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entitlement to the rebate of the beneficial owner or partner that is a company will be determined as if it was a shareholder and had received a dividend equal to its share of the income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will apply to dividends paid after 17 August 1976&mdash;the day the High Court handed down the decision in Patcorp. But the assessment of any company that was not allowed the rebate in an assessment that issued before today will not be able to have that assessment amended to allow the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deferral of Deductions for Prepayments of Trading Stock</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will affirm the principle of matching tax deductions for expenditure on trading stock against income from selling that stock in the appropriate tax year. This matching process is not just a principle of the tax law but is also a general accounting principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present law, expenditure on trading stock is initially deductible under section 51 in the year in which it is incurred. To match deductions against appropriate income, section 28 then writes back as income the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the year. By this process, deductions are deferred until the stock is sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court case of Federal Commissioner of Taxation versus Raymor exposed a weakness in the interaction of section 51 and section 28. In that case the taxpayer was able to achieve a tax timing advantage by prepaying the cost of certain trading stock that was not delivered, or even made, by the end of the relevant tax year. Because this particular stock was not on hand at year end, section 28 could not operate to defer the deduction allowable under section 51 for the expenditure incurred in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed by this Bill will ensure that a deduction under section 51 for expenditure on stock is not available until the stock becomes trading stock on hand of the taxpayer. The amendment will apply to expenditure incurred after today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tax File Number</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the tax file number provisions will deal with situations where a security, such as a share, is subject to a securities lending arrangement, or has been sold under certain `cum-dividend' or `cum-interest' contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, investors in transferable investments such as shares or debentures will be required to quote their tax file number by the `books closing time' for the investment if they want to avoid having 48.25 per cent withheld from any income paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Securities dealers' `entrepot nominee companies', which are used solely to facilitate the buying and selling of securities, will be excluded from the tax file number arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will also correct a technical defect in the current law by making the person liable to pay income for the trust the `investment body' for the purposes of deducting tax file number amounts. The amendments will have no significant effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital Gains Tax Roll-over Relief for Partnerships</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes to correct a technical deficiency in the capital gains tax roll-over provisions for transfers of partnership assets to companies wholly-owned by the partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing law, partners can obtain inappropriately high cost bases for shares received as consideration for transfers of partnership assets encumbered by attached partnership liabilities. This can result in increased capital losses or reduced capital gains when those shares are sold. These outcomes are unintended, and the law is to be amended to ensure that the cost bases of shares received in such circumstances reflect assumed partnership liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will prevent an unintended cost to the revenue, and will apply to disposals occurring after 6 December 1990, the application date for the capital gains tax partnership roll-over provisions. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Taxation of Foreign Source Income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment of the measures for taxing foreign source income in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>part X of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will reduce the income of a controlled foreign company that is attributed to resident taxpayers by the amount of dividends paid by the company to unrelated parties on certain widely distributed finance shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment, which will relieve taxpayers from an unintended liability to tax, is to apply from the time when the foreign source income measures took effect, generally the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill contains amendments which will ensure that the foreign exchange gains and losses provisions operate as intended. Any deductions for losses on a foreign exchange contract on capital account will be reduced by the amount of any offsetting gain on another contract if that gain is not included in assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rehabilitation of Mining, Quarrying and Petroleum Sites</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make minor amendments to the rehabilitation provisions to clarify their operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ensures that any rehabilitation which restores a site only part way to its pre-mining condition, or which restores only part of the site, will qualify for the deduction. It will also ensure that only depreciable expenses on plant or articles are excluded from the deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments, which will take effect from 1 July 1991, will alleviate concerns the mining and quarrying industries held on the operation of the rehabilitation provisions. They will not have any impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Research and Development Provisions in Relation to Core Technology and Expenditure on Plant</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes three minor modifications to the research and development provisions of the law, which allow accelerated deductions in respect of expenditure on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, deductions in respect of `core technology' are to be limited to an arm's length amount. Secondly, amounts of expenditure incurred on core technology are to be excluded from the calculation of the reduced deduction that is available in the case of guaranteed returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment relates to deductions in relation to qualifying plant that is deductible in three equal instalments over three years. Where that plant is first eligible to be claimed as a deduction prior to 30 June 1993, it will continue to be deductible at a maximum of 150 per cent after that date rather than 125 per cent that is to apply to  other types of expenditure deductible under the R&amp;D provisions after that date. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax&mdash;Substantiation Discretion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also amend the fringe benefits legislation to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to accept a lower level of substantiation than is currently allowable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present fringe benefits tax legislation, substantiation is required in order either to reduce the taxable value of certain fringe benefits or to ensure that certain other benefits are exempt from fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will allow the Commissioner a discretion, similar to that contained in the income tax law when considering the substantiation requirements of the fringe benefits legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we on this closing day of the Parliament consider what is going to happen to the Primary Industry Councils Bill, I remind honourable members that the people most affected by this Bill&mdash;the primary producers of Australia&mdash;are in many cases, even this evening, going around in ever diminishing circles reaping the very crop that Australia needs in order to survive in export terms. This Bill is designed to set up the framework for the establishment of additional primary industry councils. It is specifically designed to cover the establishment of a council for the grains industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, we have had Bills to establish appropriate primary industry councils covering the wool industry. This legislation is specifically deigned to provide a similar sort of council for the grain industry. It is proposed that the grains industry council comprise the president of the Grains Council of Australia with three members appointed on the nomination of the Grains Council; the chairman of the Australian Barley Marketing Federation; the president of the National Agricultural Commodities Marketing Association; the chairman of the Australian Bulk Grain Handling Authorities; the stockfeed manufacturers; the flour- millers; the president of the Australian Oil Seed Federation; the chairman of the grocery manufacturers of Australia; the malt producers will have a representative; the ACTU will have a representative; the Australian Agricultural Council will nominate someone; the chairman of the Australian Wheat Board; the chairman of the Grains Research and Development Corporation; and a government member will be appointed to the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern has been raised in my electorate by the representatives of the South Australian Co-op Bulk Handling Association about the establishment of these primary industry councils. This concern is expressed not only in South Australia but in Western Australia. Those of us in this House who represent the grain growing electorates of South Australia are aware that the chairman of the CBH in South Australia and, I am told, the chairman of the Bulk Handling Authority in Western Australia feel that there may be inadequate consultation between bulk handling authorities in dealing with this Bill. Given that the bulk handling authorities of both South Australia and Western Australia have reasonably secure financial outlooks, their concern has been that it may be appropriate for them as co-op bulk handling authorities to be represented on the council in addition to the bulk handling authorities which are already represented from other States and which do not enjoy the same sort of financial security as the Western Australian and South Australian industries. In fact, if we look at the bulk handling authorities of Western Australia and South Australia we find, to the credit of both their boards and their grower-owners, that without government funding both have capital assets of over $1 1/2 billion dollars and are in a financially sound position with bank balances in excess of $50m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is no mean achievement. It reflects on a rather different bulk handling situation in the States of South Australia and Western Australia. They have a valid point that they are currently being represented by the Bulk Handling Association of Australia, which represents bulk handling authorities that are not in as secure a financial position as their South Australian and Western Australian counterparts. Given the number of members of the Grains Industry Council, I think it would be inappropriate to expand it at this stage. But without seeking in any way to amend the legislation, we need to recognise that some of the cooperative bulk handling facilities have a viability that is not characteristic of their representation on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Council is being established to provide a broader range of industry advice compared with the grower only groups that currently offer advice to the Minister. Because the Council will give this broader range of advice, the Opposition does not intend to oppose either the establishment of the Council or the Bill currently before the House. The functions of the Council will be to keep the strategic direction of the industry under review and to report to the Minister; to inquire into and report to the Minister on matters affecting the industry and which the Council considers require investigation or action; to inquire into matters which are referred to it by the Minister; to convene industry review conferences; and to consult with other bodies and persons as it thinks fit in the long term interests of the grain industries of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Council should be made up of members who have hands-on experience and who have been grain producers. Many people who ought to be on the Council find themselves currently too busy in production&mdash;which is primary industry&mdash;to make available the time necessary to do the Council justice. We need to recognise that farmers frequently find themselves represented by people who are, in many cases, professional board representatives. It is not a criticism I can make of the establishment of primary industry councils in general or the Grains Industry Council in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet, I want to point out that currently the grains industry in Australia faces very much the insoluble problem of how to handle the subsidisation and the war of subsidy that is currently going on between the EC and the USA. When we consider that something like $55 billion a year goes into the subsidy of EC agricultural produce, we begin to see how impossibly difficult it is for Australian farmers to compete with such subsidies. Australian taxpayers, governments and oppositions cannot suppose that 17 million taxpayers in Australia can in any way match the subsidy being paid by the 270 million taxpayers in the EC and the USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the Minister gets first-hand advice of the state of affairs in the grain industry in Australia. The Government and the Opposition have not pretended that we can enter into the grain subsidy war, but the success of grain growing in Australia will depend largely on the capacity we have to get the right sort of advice to the Minister. The Government has to represent farmers in such rounds as the GATT round. We cannot hope to win the economic battle; we can only hope to negotiate our way out of the present subsidy level that EC farmers are enjoying and that the European Community governments know they cannot continue to afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that negotiation is to work, it is clearly important that the Minister be well briefed. It is clearly important that he be able to brief adequately the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) as well. I would hope that the Grains Industry Council will see itself as having a key role in this briefing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs also to be said that, if grain growers in Australia are to survive, the fundamental responsibility the Parliament has is to reduce their cost of production. The fundamental responsibility we have is effectively to encourage export income and, of course, the incentive in the Opposition's goods and services tax package is generated by an enthusiasm for increasing export income and reducing costs of production. In the interests of the grain growers and of all Australian primary producers and exporters, we have an obligation as a parliament to reduce costs of production. We have an obligation no less to encourage export income in order to meet the national debt that we have run up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides for the establishment of an effective Grains Industry Council. For that reason, the Opposition is happy to support the legislation. In fact, it does not take issue with the Bill currently before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government in June introduced a series of wool Bills to prepare the way for the future arrangements for the wool industry. Amongst those Bills was a Primary Industry (Industry Councils) Bill, which was to be used as an umbrella Bill to establish initially a wool industry council, then a grains industry council and, presumably, other councils as well. We objected to that legislation because it was going to establish a series of primary industry advisory councils by regulation rather than by legislation. That is bad government at any time. We were successful in having that Bill withdrawn and replaced by a wool industry council Bill which was for the wool industry only and in which the membership and criteria relevant to that council were there by legislation rather than coming through at some other time by regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, the Primary Industry Councils Bill, is another umbrella Bill, but it appears to be more appropriate in that any future council established will be by legislation rather than by regulation. The particular purpose of this Bill, as my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has just mentioned, establishes a Grains Industry Council. This Grains Industry Council has 17 members; in other words, just about anybody&mdash;or organisation&mdash;who has any relationship to any aspect of the grain industry is included, as well as perhaps one or two who may not have too close a relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointments to the Council are made by the Minister from those nominated by the various organisations. The Minister has the power to reject the nominations. The Council is established to provide a broader range of industry advice compared with the grower only groups, such as the Grains Council. It is interesting that the Grains Council supports this legislation because, in a way, it will reduce the significance of the Grains Council as a lobbying body with government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposing the legislation, but I will be watching&mdash;I think my colleagues will also be watching&mdash;with interest to see, firstly, whether there are too many members on the Council. I have grave doubts as to the efficiency of a body with 17 members. The Council is subject to the Minister and the Government. At this stage, the Government is paying the bills and determining the membership. Just how important and independent will be the advice from that Council and how much note will be taken of it by the Government? It could be seen to be too much a creature of government rather than an independent industry body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the grains industry is considering the best options for the future. It had the Grains 2000 conference. I note that one of the ways in which this Council and other councils can have an impact on forward thinking is to have similar types of seminars or conferences covering that industry. One point related to that which concerns me very much is that the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Miller, has been talking of his visions for agriculture, including the grains industry. This is causing considerable confusion and concern in rural Australia, because people are asking whether or not his comments are government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they are not government policy, the Minister for Primary Industries should say they are not. If they are, the Minister should confirm it. If they are not government policy, I believe the Minister for Primary Industries should ask the Secretary, Mr Miller, to confine himself to his official role as Secretary to the Department. If he wants to be part of the public debate on primary industry policy formulation, he can get out of what he is doing and robustly enter that debate. If he does not, I believe there is a conflict of interest in that he is making comments which I believe are inappropriate for a senior administrator of a department, though they would not be if made by a public policy debating official. </PARA>

The other point I want to make is that the dairy industry is quite concerned that the Minister may have that industry as the next on his list for a council Bill of the same type. The dairy industry wants to make the point very clear to the Government that it has a Dairy Industry Council, which has been established for some time. The Council is made up of the different sectors of the industry&mdash;producers, processors and manufacturers&mdash;and is cooperating and working very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry has the most value adding of any of the primary industries, with a range of value adding that takes place before export&mdash;in Australia rather than offshore. There is a different situation in most of the other primary industries. The industry is covering that situation very well at present. For all these reasons, the Government would do well to leave the industry alone rather than try to shape it into what the dairy industry considers to be not as effective or accountable an organisation. As I indicated earlier, the Opposition will not be opposing this legislation but will be watching its efficiency and value with some interest so that we can determine our position with regard to it and other councils when we become the government after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill amends the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority Act 1988. The amendments to this Act arise from changes to assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries announced by the Government in the March industry statement this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I might just take a few moments, as the hour is late, to express similar sentiments to those of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for the tremendous support that we in this House have enjoyed from those people who make our lives a lot easier than otherwise might be the case. Just reflecting on the year, I can only endorse what the Prime Minister said, that is, that it was a momentous year of change internationally. I think that what staggered most people was the pace of that change; how unexpectedly fast it was. Few of us just 12 months ago could have predicted the pace of that change, the break-up of the Soviet Union, the pressures in Yugoslavia&mdash;the staggering pace of change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for Australia, of course, it was a very hard year. It was a year when many Australians faced the reality of the deepest recession in 60 years. It is therefore going to be a pretty lousy Christmas for a lot of Australians. The challenge is there for all of us in this place to turn this place in the direction that it ought to go; that is, to ensure that there is good government, that the decisions that ought to be taken are taken and are taken quickly. The pain and hardship being experienced by average Australians today have not been experienced before by most of them in their lifetime, although some of them remember what their parents told them about the difficulties of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year was also a very good year for the Opposition. It was a year of hard work. We produced a major plan for the rebuilding of the Australian economy&mdash;our Fightback package. As a party and as a coalition, it was a fightback for us too. We put the differences and the divisions behind us and got on and did the job. I am very pleased with the teamwork that was shown in the course of the year. A lot of people have contributed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must begin by thanking my colleague from the National Party of Australia, Tim Fischer, for the tremendous contribution that he has made to building a very effective coalition. I think it is the strength of that coalition which has been fundamental to our capacity to put together such an honest and substantive Fightback package as we have been able to achieve this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my deputy, Peter Reith, I must say that he did a fantastic job&mdash;a phenomenal job in the amount of work that was done in putting that Fightback package together. Honourable members will notice that he is on my right-hand side these days. He has moved in that direction in the course of this year, and I am pleased to see that. But there was a tremendous amount of work done on that package. An enormous amount of detail went into that package. Never has there been a more detailed package brought down by an opposition and, dare I say, by many governments in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robert Hill has run our Opposition in the Senate and has given the Government a good run in the Senate. I formally record our recognition of the tremendous contribution that he has made in the other place. To our Manager of Opposition Business, Wal Fife&mdash;I am not going to stand up here and say that I love Wal Fife. But Wal has made a phenomenal contribution to our side. What Bob Hawke said is true; Wal is a man of outstanding experience and integrity. That is evident every day. He is a very fine Australian who has a unique capacity, I think, to temper the enthusiasm of younger Turks around him. I think that is a very good thing, being one of those who have only recently come to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I should also acknowledge the outstanding contribution of all the shadow Ministers on this side. They have worked very well as a team through a very detailed and laborious process of putting the Fightback package together. So I thank them all for their contribution.

To our Whips, Bob Halverson and Noel Hicks, Neil Andrew and Garry Nehl, I express my thanks for their tremendous contribution as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the Clerks, particularly Lyn Barlin for the very quiet, professional and efficient manner in which he conducts this Parliament. Of course, I wish to thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, Phil Bergin, who has assumed that role in the course of this year and done an outstanding job. I wish to thank the parliamentary staff. There are many of them whose contribution we need to acknowledge. I refer to the PLO, Clare Nairn, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters, the attendants, the Bills and Papers Office. I wish to give special thanks, particularly given the amount of work we gave them this year, to the staff of the Parliamentary Library. I thank the catering staff, our drivers and so on.

I would say at the outset to the honourable member for Wills that I wish him well in his life after direct politics&mdash;whenever that might be. I want also to make one other point. I had the privilege of going to the seventy-fifth anniversary celebrations at Gallipoli last year. It was a rare privilege to go with a group of members from both sides of the House&mdash;the Prime Minister, who was the host-in-chief, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and the Leader of the Opposition &mdash;and more particularly with those veterans of World War I. It was a very moving occasion. Certainly, it was one which I was very honoured to attend on behalf of the parliamentary National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want also to say that I was a very new leader of the parliamentary National Party at that time. I had been elected just a few days earlier. In a situation in which the Prime Minister had a large number of official calls to make and had the whole cacophony of a bilateral visit as well as the Gallipoli visit, it was a matter of record that he extended every courtesy and additional courtesy on the occasion to both the Leader of the Opposition and me and made us feel very welcome and comfortable with the particular pilgrimage that we were making, including a very memorable day, the day after Anzac Day, when we crossed the Bosphorus on a boat&mdash;and survived&mdash;and attended a luncheon which I will also remember. I just want to place on record that it is perhaps, in these parting moments, a sign of the man that on that occasion he was a perfect host and catalyst to the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli. I salute him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I disagreed with the Prime Minister on the partisan political front.

I might also take this opportunity to express to my coalition colleagues and to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, my thanks for their liaison and cooperation throughout the year and, indeed, I pass on my thanks for all the arrangements associated with the progress which has been made this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also express my appreciation to the Clerks, to the staff of the House and the Parliament, to the transport office, to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, to the Parliamentary Library, to the catering service, to the national press gallery and, indeed, to my own staff for all the assistance which I have been afforded throughout this long, hard year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add two other things. It is my hope to spend this Christmas Day at home and not in Namibia or in the Gulf.

But I did bring back some presents for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is normal for me to make some remarks adding to those of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other speakers, and likewise for my counterpart from the Opposition at this time of the year. For me this is a day of great sadness on two counts, first because I sat to listen to the Prime Minister for the last time deliver the valedictories here. I think there is no member of the House who does not wish him well in his future. It is a measure of his contribution to the history of our Party that, as I had pointed out to me the other day by a friend of my father, although my father served something like three times as long as I have in this place, I have served three times as long as he did as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a member of the Labor Party to have had that privilege when we have had the rough end of the pineapple of Federal politics virtually since Federation is a mark of a sea change which will be of great historical record in times to come. The person who led us through that period, and who put us there in the first place, was the Prime Minister. His name and record are fixed forever in the history of this country and he needs no defence from me, or from any other member of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for my sadness is what was referred to as the departure of Johnno. Johnno is a total political animal. It will be of interest to honourable members to know that he actually did not come from the branches or a background with the Labor Party with a long record of interest in party politics, as do many of our good staffers. He was in the Department of Defence and firstly came across to my office as a Defence official. He stayed on and grew to love this place and the members in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am loath to say too much more about Johnno, and I will not for the sake of brevity and because fundamentally I think he is engaged in a hoax. I do not want to farewell him too fulsomely in case he takes it seriously. I know he is looking for something like double the normal four weeks annual leave and a few really decent Christmas gifts for a change, and then will return fully refreshed for the fray. Nevertheless, I express my very great thanks to him and anticipate a manifestation of yet another visitation by him at some point of time in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people have been thanked here in detail, and I will not mention them again.

Both sides of the House rely heavily on him and on his staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people have not had the mention they usually have, but they do still deserve it. There is Liz who cuts our hair on occasions, and Aussie, and all those who run the small enterprises, official and unofficial, around the House.

The Whips are very important to the effective functioning of our side of the House, as I know the Opposition Whips are to that side. I wish them a very restful Christmas.

When an election is held in this country, the party that wins is very happy; the party that loses is very disappointed. But the party that loses always respects the decision of the people. As I said in another debate earlier today, democracy is all about the opinions and decisions of the majority prevailing and the opinions and voices of the minority being heard.

It is a special, historic occasion. It is not often that a change of Prime Minister occurs during the lifetime of a government. It is even less often that it occurs while the Parliament is sitting.

We will continue to disagree. The mere achievement of so many electoral victories has shown something of his skills as an Australian and as a political leader.

There is a greater respect on both sides of the House for the other point of view; I think that is very important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The infrastructure support program is designed to provide assistance in areas such as research and development, skills and training, marketing and management services where such assistance is currently not provided under other Government programs.

<PARA>Other legislation covers the last two programs. In the March industry statement commitment was made to the continued provision of up to $120m through the IDS over the period until 30 June 1995. At the same time the decision was made to increase the annual allocation for the incentives for international competitiveness and infrastructure programs from $10m to $15m and to allow the Authority to roll over funds not spent in any one year to the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These programs will assist TCF firms to respond positively to greater import competition. As protection falls, firms will need to review their competitive strategies to focus less on price and more on design, quality and service.

We will not be opposing the Bill and, in the interests of members of this House, we will not be taking very long about speaking to it. Of course, the Bill is of minor importance in the greater scheme of things, but I must say just a few things about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the survey by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures predicted that unemployment would be at 11 per cent by Easter, and even that alarming prospect could be optimistic as thousands of school leavers flood onto the job market which has not many jobs to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The textiles, clothing and footwear industry has not escaped this holocaust. Indeed, 20,000 TCF jobs have been lost in the last two years, with, of course, most jobs going in the footwear and clothing industries. In fact, the only manufacturing industry to fare worse is the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of this scenario, a Bill which rearranges a few grants schemes worth a few million dollars is not a great substitute for a comprehensive taxation reform which, for example, takes $20 billion off business taxes, which reforms government, which reforms transport and makes for leaner government sectors and more responsible macro-economic policies. In short, it is a poor substitute for the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one disputes that the TCF industries have a massive restructuring process ahead of them. Their protection levels have come down somewhat, but they remain very high&mdash;far higher than the average for manufacturing industry. But, in our view, the necessarily limiting cash grants will not provide the basis for tackling this task, for a number of reasons that are known to many people in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in the interests of time, I will be brief. This Bill proposes to consolidate the existing programs into two: the incentives for international competitiveness program, which will provide companies with specific assistance; and the broader infrastructure support program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the consolidation of these programs should simplify the eligibility criteria, and to some extent simplify the whole process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I take pleasure in introducing the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1991 to the House. The amendments provided for in this Bill are necessary to accommodate certain changes to the drug approval process which were recommended by Professor Peter Baume in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Future of Drug Evaluation in Australia</EMPHASIS> and which were subsequently accepted by the Government for early introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal thrust of these reforms is to give greater recognition to the need for early access by the Australian community to new drugs, provided of course that due attention is still paid to their safety, quality and efficacy. Thus one of the amendments is to the objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act to provide specific reference to the pursuit of timely availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of certain changes to both application requirements and to the evaluation process, it is intended to introduce certain target times for the processing of applications, with a financial penalty on Government in instances where those targets are not met. It is necessary to amend the Act to provide for the formal adoption of targets specifically recommended by Professor Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing the amount of information which is required in support of a marketing application means that greater responsibility rests with industry to report accurately and fairly on the various studies and trials which have been conducted and, where considered necessary, to provide ready access to supporting data. Professor Baume deemed it appropriate, and the Government has accepted, that companies should be penalised should they fail to honour this greater trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of the proposed reforms relates to access to unapproved drugs. In the case of patients who are seriously ill with a life-threatening disease it is proposed to leave the use of unapproved products to the patient and his or her practitioner to determine. In other cases, the limitations on access are to be reduced. It is also intended to more widely delegate the authority for approving the supply of unapproved drugs. A number of amendments have been necessary to accommodate these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that companies should be able to make, without prior approval, certain changes to the information provided to doctors concerning a drug. These are safety related changes, where it is important that the company make the changes as quickly as possible. Amendment to the registration procedures is sought for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the changes made to accommodate Professor Baume's recommendations, a further amendment has been included in this Bill. This relates to certain labelling requirements presently applying to registrable therapeutic goods that are intended for export only. The Bill removes the need for sponsors of such goods to comply with labelling requirements that have relevance only for the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would have been easier to address the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill if I had had a copy of the amendments or the changes to the amendments. My record in terms of the Therapeutic Goods Administration is well known. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on several occasions I have been very critical of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We have been very supportive of the report by Professor Peter Baume, a former member of the Senate. His main aim was to improve access to drugs, pharmaceuticals, and yet maintain the provisions for protecting the public from inappropriate, ineffective or dangerous drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the emphasis from the bureaucracy has been very much on protecting Australians from new drugs that have not been thoroughly evaluated. That is something which we support, of course, except that the evaluations which have been required have been, I think it is fair to say, over the top. The documentation that has been required has been excessive. Only last week I found out about a drug for which the amount of documentation required by the TGA for the application was in the order of 86 volumes. Most of that documentation had been evaluated in at least five, if not six or seven, overseas countries. That product is available in almost every Western country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is a duplication of a number of processes carried out overseas. We have said&mdash;and Professor Baume has also endorsed it&mdash;that the process is too slow, partly because of this approach. We should accept part of the evaluation processes done overseas. I was delighted to see in the report that the thrust of Peter Baume's comments was exactly this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems has been that the Therapeutic Goods Administration has been very much a bureaucrat orientated monolith. It has not been very effective, it has been very slow, it has been cumbersome and it has been unable to respond to the needs of the Australian public. A number of products have just not been made available at the time when they should have been. The suffering which has occurred as a result of this has been very real indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of drugs spring to mind. Recently erythropoietin has become available. It has taken an inordinate length of time to get erythropoietin available. The drug is not only effective in restoring the health of patients but is a cost-effective drug. The processes that have been used in drug evaluation have not saved the Government any money; indeed, they have probably cost money by keeping people in hospital or making it necessary for them to be re-admitted to hospital at times when that was unnecessary&mdash;for example, to have unnecessary blood transfusions, and being therefore kept out of the work force. The unavailability of erythropoietin has been a disaster for Australia&mdash;fortunately one that, in the last few months, has largely been corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somatonorm and other growth hormones took an inordinate length of time to come to Australia. A number of anti-cancer drugs which I was involved with in my previous career as an oncologist were not available in Australia at times when they were available overseas&mdash;and, indeed, were curing patients overseas. One particular drug, cis-platinum, was actually curing young men with multiple metastatic testicular cancer at a time when people in Australia were dying who might otherwise have been saved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An anti-rejection drug, cyclosporin, was much slower to come to Australia than to most other overseas countries. We have the current problem with deprenyl and the recent nonsense with benemid, which is made in Australia and exported to New Zealand. There was a problem with a particular batch of benemid in Australia, so the TGA said that, contrary to requests from the company involved, we could not use the New Zealand batch; however, if people went to New Zealand and brought the New Zealand batch back into Australia, they were allowed to use it. That is real Sir Humphrey stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still problems. This Bill has been considered by the Senate and three amendments were recommended. I have had no indication as to whether the Government will accept those. We will assess those in the committee stage. They related partly to the timeliness which Peter Baume, in his report, emphasised as being so important. We gave this equal weight and there was an amendment to make sure that timeliness was taken into consideration in the evaluation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also wanted to ensure that the retrospectivity of some of the penalties and some of the other aspects of the legislation were restricted. It was obviously inappropriate to put retrospective conditions on drugs which were already going through the evaluation process. We wanted to ensure that the regulations were changed. Under the new special access scheme, where drugs were imported by an individual, it would have been possible, for example, for an individual to import a 12-month supply of a drug, use some himself and sell the rest. Clearly, that was not the intention of the legislation. I understand the Government has agreed to introduce in the regulations measures to prevent this from happening by ensuring that the control of the dispensing of the product remains with the doctor in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems. However, the amendments&mdash;which I trust the Government has not altered since the Senate considered them&mdash;will correct some of the problems. The legislation is long overdue. Whether it will actually work&mdash;whether the Therapeutic Goods Administration will actually work&mdash;will depend very largely upon its new chief, Professor Geoffrey Vaughan. I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on his recent appointment. I wish him well and I look forward to working with him in implementing an efficient administration to evaluate drugs not only in a protective way, to make sure that Australians are protected from irrelevant, inappropriate or dangerous drugs, but also, more importantly, so that useful, worthwhile drugs are allowed to come into Australia at an appropriate time and over an appropriate time scale. With those things in mind, I am happy to support the legislation as discussed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, which operates as Comcare, was established under the CERC Act in December 1988 to effectively manage the Commonwealth public sector workers compensation function. The legislation introduced income-related benefits and emphasised the Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments implement changes based on a recent review of the Comcare program. The review was conducted by Mr Ron Brown, a management consultant. He was commissioned in December 1990 to carry out a comprehensive review of the Comcare program, including the self administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare provides the full workers compensation insurance function to around 250 Commonwealth public sector agencies. Australia Post and Telecom, however, have been operating as `self administrators' on a two year trial. Under the self administration arrangements, these two organisations are responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act in relation to their own staff. The review was asked to consider the effectiveness of the Comcare scheme and any policy and legislative changes needed to better achieve the Government's objectives. The review acknowledged the success of improvements in workers compensation arrangements and policy achieved by the Commission since its establishment. Nevertheless, it targeted additional areas where effectiveness could be enhanced. In particular, the Commission is to be restructured to separate its regulatory and service functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new provisions, the restructured Commission will be a tripartite body responsible for regulatory functions associated with the CERC Act, including determining and setting premiums, occupational health and safety and licensing of compensation self administrators. A new statutory body to be called Comcare is to be established, with responsibility for commercial and service functions under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments create a new position of Chief Executive Officer of Comcare. The Chief Executive Officer is to be a member of the new Commission and to have responsibility for all functions under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and the CERC Act, other than those performed by the Commission. The new Commission and the Chief Executive Officer of Comcare will be subject to ministerial direction and will be required to prepare annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the amendments made in this part of the Bill provide for the separation of the powers and functions of the current Commission between the new Commission and the new body to be known as Comcare. The Bill also provides for the transition from the current legislative scheme, to that which will result from the amendments, to ensure an orderly changeover. A number of other consequential changes are also made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments made to the CERC Act were the cause of some concern at the time the Bill was considered in the Senate. In order to clarify the position the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) tabled a statement further outlining the changes made to the Act by the Bill and indicating the Government's intention to introduce legislation in the autumn sitting 1992 to implement other recommendations of the Brown review, particularly in relation to licensing of self administrators. Some concerns were expressed during the debate in the Senate about the operations of the self administrators and the Minister's statement proposes an approach for dealing with these concerns in advance of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement also expands on other areas of Comcare's activities which the Government intends to further consider, such as diversification of Comcare's market base outside the Commonwealth public sector, commercialisation of Comcare and a special redemptions arrangement for some beneficiaries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill amends the Act to allow for a joint application to be made for an assessment certificate in relation to a new industrial chemical. Currently, the Act does not allow a joint application by two or more persons for an assessment certificate in relation to the importation and use of the same new industrial chemical. Where two or more persons wish to have the same chemical assessed, the Act currently requires separate applications to be submitted to the Director of Industrial Chemicals and the required information to be supplied by all applicants. This results in overlap in the information provided to the Director. It has also inhibited cooperation between applicants, usually companies, in the manufacture and use of industrial chemicals. The practice also leads to unnecessary duplication and inefficiency in the chemicals industry. </PARA>

As a general rule Australia does not ratify a convention until law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions complies with the requirements of the convention. The proposed amendments are intended to achieve compliance with two maritime conventions, thus enabling them to be ratified.

Although there is substantial compliance in practice, some States and the Northern Territory do not have legislation giving effect to the conventions. The two conventions apply to seagoing ships.

These orders and regulations will not, however, apply where any existing or future law of a State or of the Northern Territory gives effect to the conventions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few brief remarks regarding the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 which will be particularly cogent. I will not overly attempt to take the time of the House at this most difficult time considering the late hour that we are likely to be sitting. It must be pointed out to the Government that the most important amendments in this Bill are those relating to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988&mdash;the Comcare enabling Act. These amendments are based on Mr Ron Brown's review, commissioned last December, completed and handed to the Government in April, and published but not tabled in September. This is a quick Government, is it not? This rather inept, failed Labor Government is like most of the bureaucracy it is associated with&mdash;it is slow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has proposed a second reading amendment. We are critical of the non-response of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in his very offhanded second reading speech. After not tabling the report, he picked up only one recommendation, which was to split the Commission, and he ignored the other recommendations. He did not really address the content of the report. We believe that Comcare should be privatised. In that respect, despite the lateness of the hour, we should briefly examine the very major difference between the Government and the Opposition with respect to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view&mdash;it may not be shared by all in the House&mdash;that the most major issue we address in this nation that is holding us back from real, progressive movement in terms of productivity, change, and providing new jobs and new opportunities is related to the industrial relations portfolio. Those changes are about to come. Those differences in the Government of Bob Hawke, the Government of Paul Keating and the Government to be of John Hewson are significant because in 1976 the Liberal and National parties finally made a decision, after decades of equivocation, to come down in favour of massive change in terms of our centralised, bureaucratic, inefficient, old-fashioned, irrelevant industrial relations system. The changes that the coalition proposed in 1976 are as relevant today as they were then, and they will be implemented in 1993 or before when there is an election and we have a Hewson government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those opposite who do not understand what we propose, those changes are that we will allow individuals&mdash;that is, employees and employers&mdash;to decide for themselves in the marketplace what sort of agreement they will come to, their wages, long service leave, how much holiday pay they will receive, and the wages applicable before dismissal. All the items that are appropriate to employer and employee negotiations will come before the employer and the employee. That means that the Industrial Relations Commission, the centralised system, the club, which includes major employer associations, the ACTU, and the major union players in Australia will be out of a job&mdash;done, finished. In fact, we will increase unemployment in Australia because we are going to get rid of a very major part of the industrial relations club that has for so long held this country back and has for so long caused us problems in many areas, including training, which is a major issue today!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am the Deputy Chairman, released a report in the House today entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills training for the twenty-first century: a report on skills training apprenticeships and traineeships.</EMPHASIS> One of the things we said in that report is that the rigidities and demarcations that exist within the industrial relations system today in this country must cease in terms of employee training or we will not have any employees next year or the year after that. Why? Those opposite know, as I do, that no apprentices are being taken on by industry. Why not? The reason is that the economy is in recession. We have not encouraged industry to employ new trainees and we have not empowered TAFE to teach people a trade or a vocation without first having a contract of employment with their employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still believe in the master-slave relationship of apprenticeship which was appropriate in the 1700s and maybe the 1800s, but certainly not in the 1900s or beyond the year 2000. We have very major differences with the Government, with the new Government and with the new Prime Minister in terms of industrial relations policy. That will ultimately prove to be the test between us and those opposite who claim to represent, firstly, the average worker and, secondly, the working class of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my contention that today we represent the workers in Australia. We offer workers in Australia not only hope but vision, improved financial reward and the opportunity to cooperate with their employer in a cooperative venture to manufacture profits from which they will benefit. It is important, despite the empty House, that we consider this major difference between the Labor Party and the coalition because it is not a goods and services tax or a taxation reform package that divides us so significantly. Government members wanted a GST. They would be delighted to get rid of employment taxes and would be happy if they could get rid of the blessed fuel excise and were able to rationalise taxes with respect to road transport. So they agree with us in that respect. There is no problem there. We disagree because those opposite are controlled and subsumed by the union movement and the ACTU, which control the agenda of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A long time ago when the Labor Party thought about changing the taxation system, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is to be our new Prime Minister, thought it was a good idea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I forgot the girls. The ACTU said, `Boys and girls, no, no, no. We are not going to have anything to do with a goods and services tax'. So Bob Hawke rolled over, Paul Keating rolled over and they all rolled over. They lay down and that was the end of the ball game, because the ACTU and the union side of the labour movement control the agenda on the Government side of politics. Until we fix that problem in this country, until we allow individuals the right to negotiate their own conditions of employment, their own wages and their own circumstances, we have no hope of competing in the twentieth, much less the twenty-first, century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only minor amendments to this Bill from our side of the House and from the Democrats were accepted. One of the amendments was for withdrawal of the clause enabling compliance with an ILO maritime convention, which was opposed by the Northern Territory Government. We can live with that. There are many parts of the statement which were included at our request and which commit the Minister to certain assurances about this Bill in relation to later consideration of the Brown report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I specifically note that the Minister, in his ministerial statement, on behalf of the Government, recognises the merits of commercialisation. That is important, because the Government has accepted that commercialism is critical. My side of politics thinks that Comcare should be commercialised. The Government is not quite there, but it is getting close. In this legislation, the Government introduced a series of changes to the operation of Comcare, the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees. Specifically, one of the most important aspects of that is that the Government proposes the separation of the chairperson from the CEO position. It proposes self-administration, and the Bill empowers the Commission to ensure that as far as practical there is no inconsistency in the administration practices and procedures used by Comcare and the self-administering procedures and authorities in the performance of their respective functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government itself is saying to us, `We ought to privatise Comcare. It ought to be in the hands of private providers. We ought to have a commercial operation with respect to this Government provision'. In terms of priority, the Minister said that he was going to ask the Commission to develop guidelines for, for instance, time limits for determinations and review&mdash;that is pretty significant&mdash;and procedures for review of disputed claims. We certainly should have those, or else we will wind up, as with any normal bureaucratic procedure, with no opportunity for those who feel disadvantaged to complain. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of some remaining confusion about the status of decisions and recommendations made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal I will also ask the Commission to consider this issue as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has not, and we condemn the Government and the Commission in that respect. On the subject of redemptions, the Minister went on to talk about the Brown review. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the need to consider the special circumstances of those claimants who have been most adversely affected by these arrangements, taking into account questions of equity. Therefore, we will consider, in the context of the 1992/93 Budget, a proposal for a special redemptions arrangement having regard to all factors including equity consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>We have yet to see those and we are unaware of the extent of the significance of those issues. When this issue was debated in the Senate yesterday a number of items were brought up which I think are significant and worth repeating in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) sought an adjournment of debate in order to engage in discussions and negotiations with the Liberal Party and the Democrats with respect to our concerns. Here we are at the twelfth hour. It is now 17 minutes past 12 o'clock on Thursday night and we are still debating an issue which the Minister should have completely sorted out before he brought it to the Senate, much less to this House, and we are rushing it through &mdash;even though we do not know whether a Prime Minister exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate last night Senator Chapman said that he welcomed the Minister's statement, which spelt out in much greater detail the intent of the Government with regard to the Brown report and to future legislation which the Minister has promised to introduce in the autumn session of Parliament. In the spirit of cooperation that our side of politics has tried to adopt with respect to the other side of politics in the last few days, and in discussions and negotiations with the Minister, Senator Chapman proposed in good faith that in the autumn session further legislation will be introduced and will proceed further down the track of implementing the Brown recommendations. I will hold the Minister at the table to that. From our side of the House this is an agreed statement. We accept the Minister's statement that he will further consult with us and that he will bring down further legislation which will be agreed between our side of politics and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hour is late, but I cannot in all conscience conclude without saying that the most major difference between those opposite and our side of politics is industrial relations. It is an issue which will not go away; it is an issue which we will discuss time and time again in this place, because it is an issue which is at the heart of real reform of our economy, of real reform of operations in industry, of an opportunity to expand industrial operations in Australia and stop the regression which is occurring at present. We are not opposing this Bill, but with these few words I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to ask the Government, with its new Prime Minister, to consider in all good faith the adoption of our recommendations for voluntary union membership, for the end of the closed shop and for true enterprise agreements in the Australian industrial context. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the early hours of 29 November, after reporting a message from the Senate returning the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), the Deputy Speaker made a statement drawing to the attention of the House the question of whether the Senate was in fact able to amend the Bill in the way it proposed to do or whether the matter should have been dealt with by way of request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now had an opportunity to study this matter in some detail. I have concluded that the concerns reported by the Deputy Speaker were indeed well founded. The third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.</PARA>
<PARA>By amendment No. 8 to the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 4), the Senate sought to extend eligibility for Job Search and Newstart allowances to certain farmers, subject to a number of conditions&mdash;which were set out in detail in the amendment. Payments for Job Search and Newstart allowances are funded from special appropriations and the effect of extending eligibility to another group of persons&mdash;although subject to conditions&mdash;is, in my view, to increase the charge or burden on the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record suggests that those senators who spoke on this matter believed that they were considering an extension of monetary benefits to a group of persons not previously eligible for those benefits. The supplementary explanatory memorandum presented earlier in connection with the Government's proposed amendments supports this view; it contains an estimate that the financial impact of the amendments would be $11.7m in 1991-92 and $20m in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is mentioned in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> at page 445, difficult questions of interpretation can arise on the issue of the Senate's right to amend Bills. At one extreme almost every amendment could be seen as causing some degree of charge or burden on the people, whilst at the other extreme it could be argued that an amendment can be made by the Senate unless it can be proved as a matter of strict logic that it explicitly and necessarily causes an increased charge or burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither of these positions is appropriate. The better approach when such an issue arises is rather to ask what are the practical consequences of a proposed amendment. In terms of Senate amendment No. 8 to the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 4), the answer to this question must surely be that there will be an increased charge or burden on the people. Had the amendment been initiated in this House, it seems certain that, if a Governor-General's message recommending appropriation had not been supplied, the requirement for it would have been recognised.</PARA>

<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing to the House the  National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991 at 27 past 12 on this rather momentous day of the parliamentary sittings. The Bill will establish a National Road Transport Commission and bring into effect the inter-governmental agreement, which was signed on 30 July 1991 by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the heads of government of all the States and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the Commission to be responsible for the development and recommendation of national road transport legislation and road use charges. This includes the preparation and provision of guidelines and principles of administration. The functions and powers of the Commission will be those that are set out in the inter-governmental agreement, which is included as a schedule to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides the administrative framework for the National Road Transport Commission. National road transport legislation will be developed by the Commission once it is established and will be introduced as separate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the inter-governmental agreement, national road transport legislation will be limited in its coverage to vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of more than 4.5 tonnes. Extension of the jurisdiction of the Commission to include light vehicles is currently under consideration through the Special Premiers Conference processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that this Bill does not in itself affect current road transport legislation or charges. It simply establishes an institutional framework for a national, co-operative approach to the development of future road transport legislation which is consistent across jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will be required to develop and recommend national road transport legislation and charges to a ministerial council. The ministerial council consists of  Ministers representing each of the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Government. Each Minister has equal representation on the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory does not have a member on the ministerial council, as it is not a signatory to the inter-governmental agreement. Although it decided not to sign the agreement, it does support the establishment of the Commission. The Northern Territory has stated that it will implement non-charging regulations which are agreed to by the ministerial council. In recognition of this commitment, the Northern Territory has been granted observer status at the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the contents of the Bill, I will outline the issues that will be considered by the Commission and the work that it will be undertaking. This Government is committed to a competitive and efficient transport system. Cheaper and more efficient transport means greater success in ensuring Australia's industries are more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More rational road use charges will provide the signal to improve the economic efficiency of the vehicle fleet and use and management of the road system. The road asset is one of the community's largest investments and increasing returns on this asset will provide significant, lasting benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport has a strategic role to play in improving Australia's international trading performance. It employs around 400,000 people and contributes about 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Road transport alone accounts for about 4 per cent, or approximately half, of the transport component of national income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, it is an intermediate service that is used by almost every industry and consumer. Virtually every product has at some point been carried by a road transport vehicle. Manufacturers rely increasingly on</PARA>
<PARA>just-in-time deliveries. The quality of the service directly affects the efficiency of the rest of the economy. Thus, any initiative that improves the performance of road transport will have a positive effect on the rest of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport has a pervasive influence over the efficiency of our economy and improvements in the system will have significant national benefits. The Industry Commission has estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional $6 billion dollars in gross domestic product every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have demonstrated our commitment to gaining an efficient rail sector through the establishment of the National Rail Corporation earlier this year. The National Road Transport Commission will also play a pivotal role in developing an efficient, national operating environment for road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has been striving to improve the operating environment for the road transport industry since it came to office in 1983. It has achieved significant improvements in industry efficiency in recent years through the development of more uniform technical and operating standards for heavy vehicles, particularly the adoption of uniform mass and dimension limits. Most progress has been made on technical issues where the Commonwealth has the clear power to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 has ensured that uniform national design standards apply to all vehicles new to the Australian market. The Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 provided the Federal Government with the means to encourage the harmonisation of regulations affecting heavy vehicles. This legislation introduced the Federal interstate registration scheme for vehicles engaged solely in interstate trade. The scheme enabled the achievement of a uniform 42.5 tonne mass limit throughout Australia, which delivered major productivity gains to road transport and the Australian economy. Most recently, the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Act 1991 has allowed B-doubles to be registered under FIRS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous attempts to introduce harmonisation across different regulatory and charging environments have relied on two factors: agreement being reached in the Australian Transport Advisory Council; and, on the implementation of these agreements, through policy directive and/or complementary legislative change. As ATAC is only an advisory and consultative body with no powers to require individual jurisdictions to implement agreed proposals, this process has had limited success in achieving a nationally consistent approach. Each State and Territory still has its own legislation covering the registration, regulation and charging of heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes the Commission different from previous attempts at such a cooperative process is that it alone will develop charges and regulations for consideration by governments. The Ministerial Council will be a determinative body overseeing a streamlined legislative and regulatory process. A fundamental aim of the intergovernmental agreement is to ensure that a transparent road use charging system is developed which provides a clear link between road use and the contribution to the costs of road maintenance by the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, there is little clear relationship between road use and damage caused by heavy vehicles and charges paid by road users. A road transport operator sees little or no direct connection between his or her use of the road and what is paid for this privilege. The intergovernmental agreement requires the introduction of a national charging structure comprising a nominal administration charge, a road use charge component of Commonwealth diesel excise and a registration or mass-distance charge for vehicles which do not meet their road costs through fuel payments alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road use part of diesel excise is to be structured to avoid the imposition of mass-distance charges on most of the heavy vehicle fleet. The level of charges will be developed by the Commission based on the following principles: full recovery of all road costs while minimising over-recovery from any vehicle class;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a common methodology;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">charges to be determined and collected in a way that achieves a reasonable balance between administrative simplicity, efficiency and equity in the charging structure;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">improved pricing, leading to a better allocation of resources, with investment decisions being based on more relevant demand signals; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">minimising the incentive for operators to `shop around' for lower charges and undermining the integrity of the national charging system. </PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of the varying road costs in different parts of the country, two zones have been established for the purpose of charging. These zones generally reflect on the one hand the States with higher road costs, and those with lower road costs on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the National Road Transport Commission is the direct result of the resolve shown by all the States and the Commonwealth through the Special Premiers Conference to develop an efficient national structure for land transport. It will be the focal point of a more efficient and clearly defined process for gaining nationally consistent charges and regulations relating to heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. The Bill provides for the Commission to have three part time members who will be chosen for their ability to bring an independent view and range of experience to the Commission. Each member will be appointed by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Ministerial Council, for a term of three years and may be reappointed only once. From the three members, one will be appointed as Chairperson of the Commission and another as Deputy Chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the Commission will be to facilitate improvements in road transport efficiency and road safety, and reductions in the costs of administration of road transport through a cooperative process between local government, the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth. The implementation of lasting reform is only possible with the cooperation of all levels of government and affected transport providers and user groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the Bill sets out the functions and powers which will enable the Commission to achieve its objectives. In particular, the Commission will have those functions and powers that are conferred upon it in the intergovernmental agreement. The Commission will exercise responsibility for the development of road transport legislation and for overseeing its administration by the States and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key aspect of the work of the National Road Transport Commission will be the development and recommendation of road use charges. The Commission will be required to report on or provide advice to the Ministerial Council on any matter relating to its powers and functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is clear emphasis on the accountability of the Commission to governments through the Ministerial Council, the Commission will be reflecting the broader interests of the community. To assist it in discharging its responsibilities in this regard, the Commission will consult widely with interested parties, including the road transport industry, industry in general, and the people and government organisations from rural and remote regions. It may also appoint committees to assist it in discharging its duties under the terms of this legislation. These committees will have such membership as the Commission considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the administrative provisions of the Bill. This part of the Bill sets out the conditions relating to members of the Commission. It also establishes the basic meeting procedures for the Commission and provides for disclosure of interest by individual members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staffing provisions will enable the staff of the Commission to reflect the Commission's national character. The Commission will be able to employ staff, within the limits of its budget, from the public and private sectors. A chief executive officer will be appointed by the Commission to manage the operations of the NRTC according to the directions and policies determined by the Commission. Staff may also be employed through secondment arrangements with Commonwealth, State or Territory administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the finance provisions of this Bill, the Commission will receive funding from the Commonwealth, the States and the Australian Capital Territory. The funding share of each Government will be determined by the Ministerial Council as set out in the intergovernmental agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment and running costs of the National Road Transport Commission will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories party to the intergovernmental agreement. At the first Ministerial Council meeting it was agreed that the Commonwealth would contribute a 35 per cent fixed share of costs with the remainder being shared by the States and Territories based on heavy vehicle registrations. It is anticipated that the Commission's annual budget will total $3m to $4m. The Commonwealth has included a provision of $1m in this year's Budget as its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of the Commission in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the final, miscellaneous provisions of the Bill. In regard to the powers and functions of the Ministerial Council, the Ministerial Council may delegate any or all of these to any one or more of its members. Such delegation must be made through a unanimous decision by the members of the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will cease to be in force after six years. At least six months prior to this, the Commission is required to make a recommendation to the Ministerial Council as to whether the legislation should be re-enacted. This follows the procedure established in the intergovernmental agreement. All members of the Ministerial Council and the Australian Local Government Association have considered the Bill and  agree that it reflects the letter and spirit of the intergovernmental agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the Commission will reduce duplication of work between the States and the Commonwealth. It will also ensure that all governments will be working from a common perspective. No longer will we be in the situation where nine different bureaucracies are working to develop nine different sets of regulations affecting road transport. For the first time we will have nationally consistent regulations governing heavy vehicles. This is a significant achievement and is a clear demonstration of the maturity of Australia as a nation. It reflects great credit on the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is in the chamber tonight. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I am appalled at the way the Government has handled the National Road Transport Commission Bill. Quite contrary to the words of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who introduced this Bill, the fact is that the Minister, who is now present and sitting at the table, has been totally disorganised. He could not even get it into this chamber in time for the matter to be debated here first, so it was rushed into the Senate and now we are trying to debate it in the dying hours of this final session of the Parliament for 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the debate is being curtailed because of the late hour and because the Government is trying to rush through so much legislation at such short notice. I think it is an appalling abuse of the Parliament. It is an insult to the Parliament. It shows the level of interest the present Government and its Ministers have in true parliamentary democracy. It is an important piece of legislation, and I think it is appalling that so many members of this chamber who may have wished to make a contribution now feel, because of this very late hour, that they will be restrained from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When listening to the second reading speech I must admit I thought that this must have been another piece of legislation. Some of the comments in that speech really did not reflect the thrust of this legislation or the effect that this legislation will have on the road transport industry. In the brief time I will speak tonight, I will take up some of the key points I noticed in the Minister's second reading speech which really ought to be refuted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister spoke about getting cheaper and more efficient transport; yet he notes that this Bill is restricted to vehicles heavier than 4 1/2 tonnes. Anyone who has studied this matter knows that this Bill is about increasing the charges on heavy vehicles. The Government has failed to get any agreement from the States. Although in fact it made reference to the Special Premiers Conference, I think all honourable members would be aware that the last Special Premiers Conference failed dismally. In fact, it fell into a heap because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) no longer held the respect of the Premiers. Maybe the Government has taken some steps to change that situation today, but we will not deal with that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about this Bill leading to cheaper and more efficient transport is a joke. It is all about increasing the cost to road transport operators. Certainly that will not lead to cheaper and more efficient transport. This matter has been drawn to the attention of this Government on many occasions&mdash;in the Senate, in the special inquiry that the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure held last Wednesday, and on numerous occasions in many public forums. The Minister is well aware of this. Yet he goes on and on talking about how he consults with industry. He seems to take no notice of the concerns that the industry raises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter referred to in the second reading speech was the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. It was spoken of as though that was done earlier this year. As the Minister is well aware, the legislation for the establishment of the National Rail Corporation has not passed through this Parliament and it is unlikely to pass through the Parliament this year. So much for the so-called improvements the Minister spoke about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister talked about the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 which is designed to encourage the harmonisation of regulations affecting heavy vehicles. If one talks with some of the operators who face the problems as they travel from State to State one finds there is not too much harmonisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister talked about the Interstate Road Transport Act allowing B-doubles to be registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme. Whilst that is partly true, it is equally true that the Labor Government in Tasmania has not allowed B-doubles to be introduced into Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said that a fundamental aim of the intergovernmental agreement is to ensure that a transparent road use charging system is developed which will create a clear link between road use and the contribution to the cost of road maintenance. A continuing objection the coalition has put to the Government, and one which road users have put to the Government, is that the Government continues to ignore the level of taxation on the road transport industry. Yet this Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport, had the gall, back in May, to say to the National Farmers Federation that he agreed that the road transport industry was taxed at 3 1/2 times the rate of other industries. The Minister sits there in front of some very significant road users in this community and tells them that, yes, the road transport industry is overtaxed. Yet when he introduced this Bill he had the gall to say it would lead to a cheaper and more efficient transport system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say to the Minister is that, if he wants to do that, he should have a look at what the coalition has put forward in the Fightback package, in which we talk about real reform and the real way of getting the cost of road transport down&mdash;that is, of course, by taking the excise off fuel. I think the Minister could do a lot better if he had a look at some of the things that we are offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then tries to gloss over the fact that he could not get agreement amongst the States. It was not this Minister; I should say that the Prime Minister could not get agreement&mdash;this was taken out of the hands of this Minister&mdash;and, therefore, two zones were introduced. That matter is glossed over by the Minister with the use of the words `in recognition of the varying road costs in differing parts of the country'. That was not the point. When the Minister knows full well that the reason there are two zones is entirely that the Prime Minister could not get agreement from the Premiers of those less densely populated States, I do not know how he can come in here and make a second reading speech that tries to claim otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I come to some of the other details of the Bill, I would like to mention quickly a couple of other points from the Minister's second reading speech. He mentioned the fact that the legislation will cease to be in force after six years but, six months prior to that, the National Road Transport Commission will be required to make a recommendation to the Ministerial Council as to whether the legislation should be re-enacted. I would like the Minister to find an example of a government body which, having been asked to review itself, does not recommend that it continue in existence irrespective of its need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in his second reading speech, the Minister made the claim that, for the first time, we will have nationally consistent regulations governing heavy vehicles. It would be great if we had that but, unfortunately, as the Minister full well knows, this Commission is not going to be able to make that sort of recommendation because of the difficulties that have been encountered with the States. To make such a claim in the second reading speech is highly misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this Bill, I would like to say that, as it was introduced in the Senate, my coalition colleagues there have gone to considerable lengths to, first of all, expose some of its weaknesses and to highlight some of the concerns that the road transport industry and road transport users have about the shortcomings of this Bill. I do not wish to canvass all of those. I would hope that people who are particularly interested will look to the Senate debates to see the detail. I pay special tribute to my coalition colleagues in the other place who have gone to considerable lengths to try to bring some commonsense back into the debate not only through their speeches in the other place but also through the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. They were prepared to spend many hours&mdash;in fact until two o'clock last Thursday morning&mdash;to ensure that people in the industry who were prepared to come all the way to Canberra at short notice were able to draw to the Government's attention some of the shortcomings of the Bill. While the Minister still seems keen to ramrod this legislation through, I believe that the onus is on him to take account of some of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that it is not the Bill itself that is objectionable; it is the schedule that is attached to it. Basically, as I pointed out, one of the major concerns that we have is that the National Road Transport Commission has not been given wide enough powers to consider the existing level of taxation that is already on the road transport industry. This point has been brought home to the Minister time and time again. If he wanted real reform, he would have the guts to stand up to the rest of his Party and say, `If we are going to get it, we have to take this into account'. Hence, the coalition has included in the inquiry that the Senate is going to undertake that this level of taxation on the road transport industry is, in fact, investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern, of course, is that the Government, having done a deal with the Democrats to set up an inquiry, has pulled the wool over the eyes of the Democrats to some extent. That inquiry of the Senate is not going to be reporting until September next year, and yet, at the same time, the NRTC is expected to make its recommendations by the end of March next year. According to what Senator Collins told the Standing Committee last Wednesday night, legislation on charging is going to be introduced in the autumn session next year. In other words, the Senate Committee is going to report after the charging legislation is to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of other concerns that I would like to raise. Not only do we have the problem of the zonal system&mdash;meaning that we do not get the uniformity that I think all of us would like to see&mdash;but we also have the problem that any State can make an application order, which means that the standards, the enforcement levels and the penalties may not be uniform. In addition, while the Government has made a big noise about the change to the Federal interstate registration scheme, as I said earlier, we do not see the B-doubles operating under a common system throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the hour is getting late, I do not want to canvass all of these areas other than to say that we have these two major concerns, which I have brought up in the second reading amendment. The coalition will be moving a further amendment in the committee stage. Again, I believe that, if the Government was serious about getting reform in this area, it would be prepared to look at the level of taxation right across the road transport industry. It would be prepared to take that into account because, as the Minister full well knows, road transport is not an end industry; it is an input to other industries. If we want to get those costs down and if we want to get that efficiency that the Minister is so keen to talk about and I think all of us would like to see, clearly the Government has to get the operating costs down and take the input taxes off. As the coalition has now given the Government a lead, it would be so easy to take up the coalition's proposals because the Government knows full well it would get support in the Parliament. If it could take that up, it would see some real efficiency gains; it would see the sorts of gains which the Industry Commission has been talking about and which the Government has been so keen to mention all around this country. The Government would then get the savings to people who want to conduct business that relies so heavily on freight. Of course, people in rural and regional Australia are those who are affected the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is not going to achieve that. We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that, if we are just to increase the registration charges for heavy vehicles, it could have a very serious impact on people living in country Australia. Despite the fact that the coalition has been calling for an inquiry into this for over 12 months, it seems that only belatedly is that to be done. It is unlikely that we are going to know the full impact until after the Commission has made its recommendations for charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, another concern that there is a very real risk that this Commission will become highly bureaucratised. Already there are at least 21 committees to make recommendations to the Commission. Obviously, the workload that is going to be on industry in trying to keep up with all of those committees will be extremely onerous. Obviously, it will make it very difficult for a lot of industry groups to keep abreast of what is going on with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I come back to the point that, if the Government really wants the Commission to have support amongst the industry&mdash;support that would be forthcoming&mdash;and if the Government is prepared to take up those options, it has to look at the level of taxation on the road transport industry. It also has to take up the challenge of looking at the efficiency of road construction and maintenance and it has to be prepared to investigate what the likely impact on rural and regional Australia is going to be if, in fact, increased charges are to be recommended. I do not accept the argument that has been put by some members of the Government that an impact study cannot be done until the charges are known. That is just rubbish. Anyone who wanted to go through some likely scenarios that have been put to the National Road Transport Commission would know full well, by doing a series of figures, that one could get some indicative impacts over a range of charges. It would be dead easy to find out what the impact was going to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hour is late. It is a great disappointment to the coalition that this Bill has not been given the full debate that it deserves in this place. As I have said, because the Government is not prepared to take on board all of the recommendations that the coalition has made in the other place and is making again here, we have moved an amendment. We are not prepared to accept the Bill in its present form. </PARA>

While some of the honourable member for Wannon's colleagues might not know, including the person who masquerades as a Deputy Leader of the Opposition, he knows that those people out in the industry know clearly what it is all about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate your protection. The Inter-State Commission was indicating that the impact of those charges would be somewhere between 50c and $1 a week. For each family, under the worst scenario in rural Australia, the maximum then would have been, say, $1 a week or $50 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who ran most with that question that has been taken up by the honourable member of Wannon is Fred Finch, the Minister for Transport in the Northern Territory. It is interesting to examine just how Fred responded. After an analysis was undertaken by him or by people who were acting for him, he said that the total impact would be something like $700 a family. Did the honourable member for Wannon endorse that?  I knew the figure could not possibly be that. When I looked through the analysis, I saw that Fred had put the decimal point in the wrong place. It was not $700, by the worst scenario; it was $70 a year. That is an example of the impact it will have. That was according to the original Inter-State Commission report. </PARA>

The honourable member for Wannon has been saying the same sorts of things about whether he would accept any assertions I make. The honourable member for Wannon can, if he wishes, question my credibility, but will he question the integrity, the professionalism and the confidence of people in agencies such as the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the Industry Commission and all the other bodies that have been given responsibilities in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

When he hawks around Australia the claim about how the proposal will devastate families and households in rural Australia, it is a deliberate misrepresentation if he understands what the position is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the national road transport reforms as well as the enormously important reforms connected with the National Rail Corporation, which have been estimated to have a value to the national economy of something like $1.3 billion every year. Yet the honourable member for Wannon has trivialised these major improvements, major reforms, major innovations, major benefits as far as land transport is concerned, just to score a few cheap points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms in national road transport will be of immeasurable value to the national economy for long into the future. All the people benefiting&mdash;people in the industry who have been seriously commercially disadvantaged in many different ways in the past as a result of lack of uniformity, inconsistency, duplication, ambiguity and confusion&mdash;are applauding the introduction of the reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second reading amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Wannon, I want to indicate that the agreement on road transport that was entered into by the Government with the States and the Australian Capital Territory, as I have indicated, was really a major achievement in establishing the framework for a nationally uniform registration, regulation and charging regime. The lack of uniformity across jurisdictions has not only imposed an unnecessary cost burden on the road transport industry; it has affected all Australians, as nearly everything we export or buy has at some point been transported by road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission is to be responsible for advising governments on the proper relationship between their expenditures on roads and the charges levied on road transport. One of the clear objectives is to separate road use charges from general taxation in order to maximise the level of accountability by governments for their policies in each of those areas. General taxation on road transport, as on any other industry sector or on the community generally, is a matter for which governments are directly responsible and involves considerations beyond any single industry or sector. There are no taxes, as distinct from charges, which apply exclusively to road transport and taxation of road transport cannot be sensibly examined in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asking the National Road Transport Commission to take account of the general level of taxation on road transport would make its task impossibly complicated. It would have to assess and address the general taxing policies of three levels of Government. Any recommendations it might make would be open to criticism not only in relation to the methodology for setting road use charges but also in relation to how well it had interpreted the social and fiscal objectives of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving the NRTC a role in broad taxation issues which are clearly beyond its purpose and expertise sits oddly with the Opposition's purported concern about delegation of powers to the National Road Transport Commission. In clearly establishing proper road use charges, the National Road Transport Commission will fulfil its role, leaving governments and the industry to address themselves to the taxation issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has accepted a Democrat amendment moved in the second reading debate in the Senate calling on the Government to address concerns about the level of taxation on the road transport industry generally. The claims that have been made by the honourable member for Wannon fall apart in the light of that. Of course, the Government has been pursuing those inquiries previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also been actively encouraging improvements in the State road authorities and the road construction industry generally. The initiatives that have been implemented under Federal road funding legislation include public tendering of construction and all major rehabilitation works, the implementation of pavement management systems, the introduction of quality management procedures and the awarding of contracts on a quality assurance basis. The National Road Transport Commission already has a role in collecting and publishing information on road expenditure of governments and its relationships to charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At their meeting in Adelaide on 21 and 22 November the Premiers and Chief Ministers agreed to enhance this role by having the National Road Transport Commission publish comparative information on road safety, road charges, road costs and the efficiency and the effectiveness of roads expenditure. This proposal was made in the context of extending the NRTC coverage to regulation of light vehicles. This will require a further Commonwealth-State agreement which would be the basis for legislative amendments in the 1992 autumn sittings. </PARA>

We went up there and we invited the honourable member along, and he graciously participated, as he generally does, in the opening.

When we met that level of funding, for some reason&mdash;a political reason perhaps&mdash;it became inadequate. But I think it is an appropriate level of funding. The honourable member for Cowper drives along the road and he knows that the amount of work being undertaken there is enormous. There are tremendously important projects. So let us not diminish the importance of it. The people in the road transport movement who want freight efficiency are benefiting substantially by the improvements which have been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). Paragraphs 8(1)(e) and (f) referred to in this section are intended merely to facilitate the Commission in the performance of its functions, which are only advisory in nature. The functions and powers that may be conferred by executive action are limited to those that come within the executive power of government, such as powers to make inquiries, to form opinions about questions of policy, and to make reports or non-binding recommendations. It would be inappropriate, and time consuming, for such actions to be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretations Act 1901, particularly as resultant decisions of the ministerial council&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fitting that the last Bill to be debated in 1991 is a Bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act. The year 1991 will be remembered as the year of the great recession, to compare with the years of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Later this morning a new Prime Minister will be sworn in. When he goes to have that commission granted to him, he will wear on his belt the scalps of nearly one million Australians&mdash;one million unemployed Australians will be hanging off the belt of the new Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981, when the metal unions had a wage campaign in the metal industry which was so disastrous for employment in this country, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the then shadow Treasurer, was heard to remark subsequently that the metal union leaders had one hundred thousand scalps hanging from their belts, the one hundred thousand they had put out of work as a result of their wage campaign. The honourable member for Blaxland has one million unemployed people hanging from his belt. As he goes out to Yarralumla, he will carry on his back the highest number of bankruptcies ever in Australian history. Nearly 13,000 Australians were declared bankrupt in the year to June 1991. That was 50 per cent up on the previous record, which was June 1990, and 150 per cent up on the peak of the 1982-83 recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But clearly, there is worse to come. In the quarter to September 1991, there was a 72 per cent increase on the September 1990 quarter in that record 1990-91 year. At that quarterly rate, one in 1,000 Australians would be declared bankrupt in the 1991-92 year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), whom we have just farewelled&mdash;some of the Labor Caucus farewelled him earlier at 6.30 this evening&mdash;often liked to compare himself to John Curtin. I suggest he will be compared in history to Scullin&mdash;Scullin, the Prime Minister who fell during the Great Depression, and Hawke, the Prime Minister who fell during the great recession. The parallels might be interesting to journalists and historians. Prime Minister Scullin, of course, was done in by the New South Wales Labor Party under the influence of Jack Lang and the divisive and ruthless machine of which he was a part. Prime Minister Hawke was done in by that same ruthless machine, the Keating forces and the new Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who learnt his politics at the knee of Jack Lang. In the future, historians will draw parallels between the great recession and the Great Depression, parallels between Scullin and Hawke, and parallels between Lang and Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we end up this year debating amendments to the Bankruptcy Act as set out in this Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1991. It is going to be a sad and sorry journey out to Yarralumla later on this morning, it now being 1.50 a.m., as this new Prime Minister&mdash;the man who gave us the recession we `had to have', the one million unemployed and the record number of bankruptcies&mdash;journeys out for his reward: the prime-ministership of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcy is a difficult area. It is an area where we must balance competing goals of public policy. On the one hand, there are the rights of creditors, people who have advanced money or property or who have entered contracts and have not been paid. They are entitled to be paid. Where a bankrupt has income or assets, it is unfair that he or she gets to keep them if the creditors go barren. Indeed, the concept of cascading bankruptcy occurs where one person goes down and is unable to pay his or her creditors, and those creditors go down as a result. Bankruptcy, particularly in the small business community, can cascade as a result of failure. So we have that goal of public policy ensuring that creditors are given maximum entitlement to income or assets that are held by bankrupts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the bankrupts themselves, people who have fallen on hard times or who have made bad decisions, have to be given the chance to clear the slate and start again. The goal of bankruptcy has always been to draw a line, as it were, to say that previous debts that cannot be paid shall be annulled or discharged, and that that person who cannot pay those debts shall be given the chance to start again, to resume a rightful place in the economic community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be careful, however, when we approach the bankruptcy law that we adequately balance those two competing goals of public policy. We must protect the rights and freedoms of citizens, without allowing the protection of those rights to become a shield for the astute and dishonest to hide behind and to hide assets or income behind, to the detriment of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much in this Bill which is an improvement on the current state of the law. For that reason, the Opposition will not decline to give this Bill a second reading. However, a second reading amendment has been circulated in my name, and I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)deplores the fact that Australia's bankruptcy levels are the worst for 60 years; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)condemns the Government for its proposal to single out business owners and operators for special punishment by disqualifying them from early discharge from bankruptcy".</PARA>
<PARA>I will come to that in due course. But on this side of the House we view one of the proposals in the original Bill as a proposal to single out for special disadvantage, by prohibiting access to early discharge, business bankrupts, as was originally proposed in section 149Y. I may just indicate that section 149Y was deleted in the Senate when the Senate considered this matter some hours ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we make that stand part of our second reading amendment because it was the Government's original intention to single out business bankrupts and to subject them to special punishment by removing access for them to early discharge. Fortunately, the Australian Democrats in the Senate have agreed with us; the Bill comes into this House amended; and I need not move that amendment again&mdash;assuming that the Government does not try to reinsert it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this amendment does indicate that the Government originally singled out, for special treatment and special disadvantage, people who had suffered bankruptcy by reason of business trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we do not believe they should be singled out for special punishment is that the overwhelming majority of those people have been put out of business by this Government. For the Government to put them out of business and then to say, `We will doubly punish you by removing your access to administrative early discharge' is to compound the felony which has been committed against them by an incompetent government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main features of this Bill are to introduce a compulsory income contribution regime; to substitute court ordered early discharge with an administrative system; to clarify the grounds on which a bankruptcy can be prolonged by self-executing objection; to impose a prohibition on overseas travel by bankrupts liable to make contributions from income without court approval; to introduce new administrative enforcement mechanisms to facilitate recovery of property into bankrupt estates; to expand the powers of official receivers to obtain information and to undertake inquiries in relation to financial affairs of bankrupts, including inquiries overseas; to clarify and codify the procedures of creditors meetings; and to enable the removal of a trustee of an estate by a majority in value rather than by a majority in number and at least three-fourths in value of creditors voting on a proposal for removal of trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come first to the proposal in relation to income contributions. The Act has always provided, by section 131, that a bankrupt is able to retain income for his or her benefit, subject to any order to the contrary. What this has meant in practice is that, if the bankrupt has income, an application must be made to the court and the court must make an order that that income become available for the benefit of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court process can be costly to invoke and, on many occasions, the trustee in bankruptcy finds that he or she will not initiate the process because creditors are not willing to advance funds to enable the action to be taken. If the order is not complied with, the sanction is contempt. Indeed, there is court authority that says a bankrupt is entitled to live the standard of life to which he or she is accustomed. Courts have been reluctant on occasions to make that income available for the benefit of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of deep concern to many in the Australian community that they see bankrupts maintaining a high standard of life whilst creditors go barren. It is galling to Australians to see bankrupts who are living high on the hog, perhaps even living well overseas, whilst their creditors are not paid. The income that they are receiving or which is available for their benefit should be going first to paying debts, rather than maintaining a high style of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendments proposed in this Bill a trustee in bankruptcy will be able to make an assessment of the income likely to be derived by the bankrupt during an assessment period, which is an annual period beginning from the commencement of bankruptcy. Persons whose assessed income is below the proposed `actual income threshold amount' will not be liable to make compulsory contributions, but may do so voluntarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a base income threshold amount equal to 3.5 times what at any time is the maximum basic rate of pension under item 3, column 3, table B, point 1064-B1, pension rate calculator A in the Social Security Act 1991. As of 1 July 1991, this refers to a gross annual income of $22,800, approximately, for a person with no dependants. The actual income threshold amount will increase by percentages based upon the child support percentages contained in the Child Support Assessment Act 1989, according to the number of dependants. Half of the assessed income above the actual income threshold amount will be payable by the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received some submissions about this which suggest that bankrupts will be forced to live in poverty and that their income will be, effectively, taken from them by reason of the amendments in this Bill. I do not believe that to be the case. As a result, we will support these particular measures because they do allow the base rate of around $22,800 of income to the bankrupt and it is only half the amount over that which will be taken off for the benefit of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be provision for the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy to authorise departure from the relevant contribution regime in cases of hardship for medical reasons, work related expenses or child-care. Decisions by trustees in relation to income assessment will be reviewable by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides that provisions be inserted enabling the Official Receiver to collect moneys owing by way of contribution from third persons through garnishment or a charge over property. The provisions enabling this to be done, sections 139ZK and 139ZL, are based on section 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and corresponding provisions in other legislation such as the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the proposals for administrative early discharge. The Bill before the House provides that people can be discharged earlier than after the normal three years by administrative mechanism. The trustee must evaluate whether the bankrupt is eligible for and not disqualified from discharge. The proposed criteria are that the bankrupt has no or insufficient divisible property to enable the dividend to be paid, that the bankrupt has not disposed of property in a transaction void against a trustee and that the bankrupt earns an income which is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the application is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various disqualifying criteria are set out which would prohibit the bankrupt taking advantage of the administrative early discharge scheme. Those disqualifying criteria pick up breaches of the law. They also pick up a situation where the bankrupt has engaged in misleading conduct, as defined. Misleading conduct is defined in section 148. It does in fact pick up many of the restrictions which are contained in the current Act in section 269&mdash;conditions such as that which state that a bankrupt must disclose that he or she is a bankrupt when obtaining goods to the value of $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, the misleading conduct which picks up those restrictions and prohibits administrative early discharge has a different quantum&mdash;the quantum of $3,000&mdash;but does in fact pick up most of those disqualifications. The disqualifying criteria that the Opposition finds objectionable are the disqualifying criteria as originally proposed in section 149Y, which states that a person would be disqualified from early discharge if that person became a bankrupt by reason of engaging in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot see why people who engage in business should be subject to such disqualification. As I have said earlier, many business bankrupts are bankrupt because of the policies of this Government. We considered that to single them out for special disqualification, as the Government sought to do in its original Bill, was to give them a double penalty not warranted by the circumstances. I am glad that the Senate has taken it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new subsection 149J, which we also object to, provides that a person is disqualified from administrative early discharge where that person's unsecured liabilities exceeded 150 per cent of income in the year immediately before the date of bankruptcy. It has been put that this is defensible on the basis that a person has run up large debts which amount to more than 150 per cent of income and therefore should be penalised in a special way. I point out, however, that if a person's income collapsed in the year immediately preceding bankruptcy, it would not be very hard for that person's unsecured liabilities to amount to much more than 150 per cent. Suppose a person went into negative income in the year immediately preceding bankruptcy. It would not be very difficult at all for such a person's unsecured liabilities to amount to much more than 150 per cent of the income derived in that last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read the legislation, that is the way in which that proposed new subsection would operate. It would, in fact, pick up many business bankrupts whose income collapses leading up to bankruptcy. We consider that to be another backdoor way of penalising business bankrupts, a corollary to proposed new section 149Y&mdash;and we find that offensive as well. That is why we have moved in the Senate to delete it. We will move here to delete it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By operation of law, a bankruptcy ends after three years, and there are various grounds on which objections can be lodged to automatic discharge. They are matters such as continuing to manage a corporation, contrary to the corporations law; failure to provide information about assets and liabilities where requested by the trustee to do so; departure from Australia; failure to attend a meeting of creditors; and like offences. We considered that, in these cases where the bankrupt does engage in conduct which is not cooperative, the period of bankruptcy ought to be extended. We support those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also restrictions on overseas travel. We support those as well. A bankrupt who is assessed as liable to make contributions from income will not be able to travel overseas except by permission of the court. Permission will be granted by the court for compassionate reasons related to death or serious illness. There are also provisions for the official receiver to recover property. The official receiver has powers to make inquiries, and these are based on the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have an amendment which enables a trustee to request that an official receiver make inquiries on his or her behalf. It is said by the Government that the Bill does in fact contemplate this being done, but it does so in the most indirect way. The Government relies in this respect on proposed new subsection 163A(2), which provides a power for the official receiver effectively to bill a trustee where he does something at the request of the trustee, but there is no actual clause in the Bill itself which gives the authorisation for the trustee actually to request that to be done. So there is a power to charge, but no actual enabling mechanism. We think that that ought to be clarified, and it will be clarified by amendment No. 2, which we will move in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clarification and codification of meeting procedures are welcome. There has been an amendment in the Senate already, which I will not dwell on. That is our amendment No. 1, which has been passed in the Senate. I need not amplify that at any length because that has already been accepted and I assume that the Government will continue with the Senate amendment in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to one final matter which I feel I should raise before this legislation is completed. A new subdivision J is to be inserted with proposed new sections 139ZQ and those following. This provides that, where a transaction is void against the trustee, the trustee can give a written notice that the money, or an amount equal to the value of the property, be paid back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an administrative scheme to recover moneys which have been alienated from the trustee in void transactions. The trustee can also take a charge over property which is void as against the trustee by administrative mechanism and a person, who could be a third party, failing to comply with a notice is guilty of an offence punishable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned about this particular provision because, under the provisions of the Act, certain transactions are declared void and then a defence is inserted in the Act which says that, if the third party can prove that the transaction was bona fide for consideration, the transaction which would otherwise be void is not avoided. The way in which the provisions have been drawn, it says in subdivision J that, where a void transaction is entered, the notice can be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that, since certain transactions, for example, under section 120 or section 122 are prima facie void and the obligation is on the third party to establish as a defence that it was done in good faith and for valuable consideration, the notice could be given on the basis of the transaction being prima facie void without the necessity to establish, as a precondition to giving the notice, that the defences do not apply; namely, the defences that it was done in good faith and for valuable consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point was drawn to the attention of the Opposition by Mr Cholmondely Darvall, QC, a member of the New South Wales bar. I was sufficiently concerned about this to write to Senator Tate, and I received a reply from Senator Tate on 18 December 1991. I feel that I should read what Senator Tate said because second reading speeches can be taken into account by courts when interpreting the law. We have not had a lengthy second reading speech but, since this is a letter from Senator Tate, the responsible Minister, to me, it effectively takes the place of a second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter does clarify that it is not the intention of the Government, by the provisions of subdivision J, to effectively deprive third parties who acquire goods in good faith and for valuable consideration of their full rights and title by reason of the provisions of subdivision J. Senator Tate said this to me in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You sought my assurance that the Bill does not contain provision having the intention or effect suggested by Mr Darvall that third parties who have acquired property from a bankrupt in good faith and for valuable consideration will be deprived of their title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing in the Bill has the effect which Mr Darvall suggests it has, nor was any such thing intended. The power of the Official Receiver to issue a notice to a person under proposed Subdivision J of Division 4B of Part VI can only be used where a transaction which under Division 3 of Part VI is void against a trustee has occurred. Where a person has received money or property from a bankrupt, but has acted in good faith and has provided adequate and valuable consideration, the transaction is not void, and the preconditions to the exercise of powers under Subdivision J simply would not arise. Any purported issue of a notice would be void ab initio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notice which is factually incorrect would not be valid. Apart from being subject to the general powers of the court to resolve all questions of fact or law arising in bankruptcy under section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, and to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to and resolve such questions, decisions by the Official Receiver to issue such a notice are also subject to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 requiring the rules of natural justice to be observed, the decision to be authorised by the enactment concerned, the decision being supported by evidence and the other matters provided for in that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Darvall's submission is incorrect, and I can assure you that it is not the Government's intention that persons should be affected in the manner he has suggested, nor does the Bill in fact do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I still have a legitimate concern about that, but I have read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the reply of the Minister because we will accept the reply of the Minister. We want to put it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to make it clear that this is not intended, so if the matter does arise in a court of law we hope that the court will have reference to that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, understand why we did not move amendments, understand why the Government took the position that it did, and understand that it is not the intention of those particular proceedings to deprive third parties who receive goods or money or property in good faith and for valuable consideration of their rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a preliminary meeting of departments on 31 October 1991, a formal interdepartmental committee (IDC), chaired by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, met on 14 November to develop the Australian response to the Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children and its accompanying Plan of Action. The IDC will also consider Australia's participation in the International Year of the Family (IYF) in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing Australia's response, the IDC will examine what further steps the Government can take both in Australia and overseas to achieve the objectives enunciated in the Declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Departments and agencies involved in the IDC include the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Social Security, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments, which have a major responsibility for issues relating to children, and non-government organisations will also be consulted in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is working towards completion of a National Program of Action as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to convening the IDC, the Government had taken a number of important decisions in response to its obligations under the Declaration and its accompanying Plan of Action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year Australia co-sponsored a resolution at the United Nations. This resolution asked countries to help developing countries reach the goals of the Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 May this year, I officially signed the Declaration on Australia's behalf and added our nation to the list of nations committed to providing support for children as a priority both at home and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as Senator Evans pointed out in the Senate on 8 October 1991, the overseas aid budget for 1991-92 includes increases in specific sectors relating to our international obligations under the Declaration. These increases were made precisely with those obligations in mind. For example, UNICEF will receive $4.1 million, a 7.3 per cent real increase on last year. International children and related programs will receive $4.2 million, a 2.1 per cent real increase. Other significant contributions will be made to maternal and child health projects in bilateral programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our contributions to UNICEF and to the World Health Organisation's Immunisation Program have also been important in helping those organisations achieve the United Nations goal of universal child immunisation.  The United Nations recently announced it had surpassed its 1990 target of immunisation of 80 per cent of children against six preventable diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aid program also includes a $20 million four year health initiative, a significant part of which is directed to improving vaccines and their delivery. Funding for further proposals in the fields of immunisation, maternal and child health, education, water and sanitation will be considered in the 1992-93 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Harare, I joined with other leaders to welcome the Plan of Action and to commit ourselves to achieving its goals. We stressed that specific actions for children should be pursued as an essential part of wider national and international development activities including poverty alleviation, human development and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These actions are a clear indication of the Government's intention to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children both within Australia and overseas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Applications made on or after 19 December 1989 are decided in accordance with the Migration Act 1958 as amended, the Migration Regulations which came into effect on that date, and subsequent amendments to those regulations where applicable. Under s115 and s137 of the amended Act the Minister has the power to intervene after a rejected application has been formally reviewed where he believes it is in the public interest to do so. As Minister I have no broad discretionary power in respect of migration applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In announcing the introduction of the new Migration Regulations my predecessor Senator Robert Ray noted that the establishment of immigration rules and criteria within the legislation would `... ensure accountable and consistent decision-making, open and fair to all...The Regulations create entitlements and restrictions at law. These must be clear and precise in intent if decisions are to be made equitably and accountably. More importantly perhaps, they allow for consistency of decision-making without undue political influence being brought to bear...'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications made prior to 19 December 1989 were, and continue to be, decided in accordance with the requirements applicable at the time of application, ie the Migration Act 1958, and relevant policy. This is provided for by subsection 6(4) of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. Ministerial discretion was exercised in accordance with the administrative law requirement that policy not be applied inflexibly. Delegated officers are also required to ensure policy is not applied inflexibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policy still has a place in the decision making process for applications lodged on or after 19 December 1989. However, most of the matters previously covered by policy are now the subject of regulations and the role of policy is no longer as significant as it once was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The estimated number of overstayed illegal entrants in Australia on 30 April 1991 was 78,000. No estimate has been made since that date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria under Migration Regulation 140 (Compassionate grounds permanent entry permit after entry) were approved by my predecessor at the time the Regulations were introduced in December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Regulation 131A (1)(d)(v) which provides for grant of an extended eligibility temporary entry permit (preliminary step to grant of permanent residence) on compassionate grounds to certain illegal entrant applicants, I have approved policy guidelines under s179 of the Migration Act 1958.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although non-residents legally in Australia have standing to seek review in some cases, the classes of visa and entry permit in respect of which non- residents have standing are generally those where there is a connection between the non-resident principal applicant and an Australian citizen, permanent resident or business.

However I am only able to exercise that power of direction if I am satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, and direction is necessary in order to ensure that the Commission's activities are consistent with major government policies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) estimates the cost of constructing a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is $275.2 million in June 1990 dollar terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The cost estimate referred to in question 1 includes all components required for construction and operation of the runway. It does not include "additional" infrastructure such as facilities for corporate aviation or off-airport improvements to the roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Supplement to the Draft EIS provides a comparison of cost estimates for a range of different concepts and scales of development for Badgerys Creek. A concept broadly equivalent to that described in the question is an airport with two runways capable of accommodating international services with a passenger throughput of approximately 13 million per annum. The estimated cost of such a development is $1960 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The estimate referred to in Question 3 includes all infrastructure required for the total airport project within the site boundary. It does not include "additional" infrastructure such as off airport improvements to roads, transport links and fuel pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) "Additional" infrastructure would be new or upgraded roads, access links, fuel pipelines etc as explained in Questions 2 and 4 above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) It is estimated that the construction of the third runway at Sydney Airport would be completed by March 1995 if commenced in January 1992. The concept referred to in Question 3 could be completed by approximately 2000/2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) (a) The Department of Transport and Communication's General Aviation Development concept in the Badgerys Creek Concept Design Report assumes that the initial Badgerys Creek development would need to cater for growth in general aviation activity and general aviation traffic which may elect to transfer from other airports in the region. A means of identifying a potential market for general aviation facilities at Badgerys Creek is to consider forecasts of general aviation activity and the capacity of existing airports to meet the forecast demand. However, the establishment of a new airport represents a significant immediate increase in the supply of airport capacity and it is difficult to confidently predict how the market will respond. Therefore, whilst it is possible to identify potential for general aviation traffic at a new airport at Badgerys Creek, it is not possible to predict levels of traffic that would choose to operate at the new facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The general aviation facility proposed in the Conceptual Design Report would take around 27 months to construct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Badgerys Creek Concept Design Report proposes an area of around 5ha be provided for general aviation support facilities which would comfortably accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 general aviation movements per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Supplement to the Draft EIS estimates the practical capacity of Sydney Airport with a third runway is 353,000 annual aircraft movements. The practical capacity of the existing two runway configuration is 268,000 annual aircraft movements using the current enhanced simultaneous operations procedures. The increase in capacity provided by the third runway is therefore 85,000 annual aircraft movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) There will be little disruption to services as a result of construction activities. The majority of the work is outside the existing airport boundary. There will be two taxiway connections to the existing runway and taxiway systems which will be constructed during curfew hours using the standard procedures for works of this type. There could be minor disruptions to operations of the CAA's runway 34 glide path due to dredging activities and also lane closures during off peak periods on General Holmes Drive with work on the taxiways and road crossings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The EIS for the third runway fully details the noise impacts as a result of operations with third runway. In general there will be increased impacts to the north of the airport and reduced impacts east and west of the airport. Impacts to the south will be largely unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The existing curfew arrangements at Sydney Airport will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The Badgerys Creek site was selected as the location of the second Sydney Airport by the Commonwealth Government in 1986 so as to allow the airport to operate curfew free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Expenditure to the end of November 1991 on the Badgerys Creek Airport site amounts to around $138 million; the principal items being site acquisition, local road upgrading, purchase of properties within the noise affected area defined by the 35 ANEF contour, and the Badgerys Creek Airport Conceptual Design Consultancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Badgerys Creek is situated in an area identified for large scale future urban development by the State Government. Provision of infrastructure will therefore need to occur in response to this development irrespective of decisions regarding the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) (a) Based on the current market value of the Badgerys Creek Airport site, it is estimated that between $77 million and $82 million could be realized through the sale of the site. Badgerys Creek has been designated as the site for the second Sydney airport since 1986 and its future development as an airport is reflected in the New South Wales Government's urban development plans for the South Creek Valley region. Consequently, it would be unrealistic to speculate what sum might be realized if the site were redeveloped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Supplement to the Draft EIS on the third runway estimates that $900 million could be realised through sale of the Sydney Airport site. This estimate is based on current market prices and allows for the removal of existing infrastructure and provision of services necessary for redevelopment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) The Supplement to the Draft EIS on the third runway addresses the impact of the provision of additional airport capacity at Sydney Airport on regional planning and urbanisation considerations. It reports that the expansion of Sydney Airport is consistent with the State Government's proposed metropolitan strategy for the Sydney region as it reinforces an existing employment centre and counteracts the current decline in employment in the airport subregion. This accords with the State Government's preference for urban consolidation so as to make better use of existing infrastructure in inner city areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) Aviation forecasts of passenger demand indicate that eventually a second airport will be needed in the Sydney region. The Government is therefore committed to the staged development of Badgerys Creek airport in response to anticipated growth in demand in the Sydney region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) The Supplement to the Draft EIS states that the development of a second airport at Badgerys Creek is viewed by the State Government in their metropolitan strategy for the Sydney region (1988) as an "opportunity to create an industrial zone for intensive advanced technology development and to provide the basis for major employment in outer areas".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) Information presented in the Supplement to the Draft EIS on the origin and destination of passengers and of passenger's choice of airports, indicates that it is likely that a large proportion of passengers would choose to continue to use Sydney Airport. An analysis of overseas experience of multiple airport systems suggests that accessibility is not the only criterion of passenger choice of airports. In addition to proximity and accessibility other variables such as flight frequency and service differentiation (eg pricing) influence passenger's preference. The analysis suggests that the attractiveness of an airport to a passenger depends on the trade off between accessibility and flight frequency, and indicates that as a second airport at Badgerys Creek would be likely to suffer a flight frequency disadvantage relative to Sydney Airport there would continue to be a concentration of passenger movements at the primary airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) The level of landing charges would be a commercial decision for the airport operator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) The general aviation facility in the Department of Transport and Communication's Conceptual Design Report is estimated to cost $53 Million in December 1990 dollars excluding land acquisition costs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, the screw worm fly facility at Laloki, Papua New Guinea will close by 31 December 1991. A contingency plan to respond to an outbreak of screw-worm fly has been developed by a national working party as part of the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN). A screw- worm fly business plan, prepared by a national working group representing State, Territory and Commonwealth governments, the National Farmer's Federation and the Australian Veterinary Association, is now being implemented to enable that contingency plan to be executed in the event of an outbreak of screw worm-fly in Australia.</PARA>

A consideration in this process is a possible shift in emphasis of its research program towards market development. The Corporation's four major objectives, include improving grain varieties through nationally-focused and market-oriented crop improvement programs, and improving industry returns from market- focused R&amp;D. In integrating breeding programs and production systems better with changing market requirements, some shift in the R&amp;D investment portfolio might be required in order to pursue a more efficient and co-ordinated program structure. Shifts in priorities could result in a reduced share of total funding to breeding aspects of crop improvement and protection but this may not necessarily result in any diminution of the effectiveness of the Corporation's expenditure in this area of research. As a first step, the Corporation has decided to conduct a review to examine what scope exists for elimination of any duplication and a more rational deployment of funds in Corporation-funded breeding programs which currently absorb about one-third of total research expenditure. Plant breeders will be closely consulted in the conduct of this review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The 1991-92 operational plan is the first annual program to be prepared by the Corporation. The program continues the trend developed in recent years by the Corporation's predecessor organisations for State Committees to put major emphasis on crop improvement, production and protection, whereas national Committees, while still maintaining solid programs in those areas, saw gaps needing to be filled in other R&amp;D fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) In terms of levels proposed in forward budgeting by its predecessor organisations, programs across the board of the GRDC's portfolio have received relatively less support in the current year's operational plan. This was necessary because of an unforeseen reduction in planned levy income, particularly for wheat, due to the sharp fall in prices and consequently value of the 1990/91 crop from which this year's income is derived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) In most cases, the Corporation did not deem the program per se to warrant reduced funding. Even after cutting into reserves, the Corporation judged that, because of the substantial reductions in planned levy income and matching Commonwealth contributions, it could not avoid the reduced research allocations without seriously endangering the basic reserve levels necessary to maintain future research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) In the Corporation's view, support for plant breeding, including the major crops wheat and barley, will play an important, integral part in the future viability of a market-driven grains sector. Sustainable rotations in the sector require integration of grain legumes, oilseeds and pasture legumes with cereals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) As a proportion of the total grains research program, support for plant breeding research has not changed appreciably since the institution of the Corporation, although planned or hoped for support could not always be maintained because of the factors referred to in (7) and (8) above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, from 7 October 1991 the US increased the countervailing duty on live pigs from Canada to $18.04 (US) per 220 pound market hog or about 22 cents (Australian) per kilogram. This amount equates to almost $A20 per Australian pig which is lighter than the Canadian pig.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US countervailing duty on live pigs from Canada is payable retrospectively by Canadian exporters who exported live pigs to the US between 1 April 1989 and 31 March 1990. The duty is indicative that Canadian producers of live pigs were receiving Government subsidies during that period and that the imports were materially injuring the US industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context the honourable member may be interested to know that the US applied a countervailing duty in 1989 of about 9 cents (Australian) per kilogram against imports of Canadian pigmeat. Canada appealed against this duty and the US International Trade Commission upheld the appeal, noting that although certain Canadian rural assistance programs were countervailable, there was no evidence of injury caused to the US industry. The duty was removed and previous duties paid were refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Canadian pork is imported into Australia tariff free, while commercial imports of live pigs from Canada are not permitted because of quarantine restrictions. Import figures show that for the 1990/91 year 1009 tonnes of pigmeat product valued at $4.4 million were imported from Canada. With Australian production of pigmeat estimated at 310000 tonnes and valued at $660 million for 1990/91, Canadian imports represented 0.3% of domestic production and 0.7% of the value of this production. For the first quarter of 1991/92 imports have reached 778 tonnes, an amount less than 1% of the estimated Australian production during this period. However it is estimated that the share of the market held by Canadian imports for boneless legs and middle cuts is around 3%-4% at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the matter of Canadian imports of pork and the possibility of mounting a countervailing case against such imports is being considered by the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and some processors, no application for action has been lodged with the Australian Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Uncooked pigmeat from Canada has been entering Australia since the Government took the decision to lift the import embargo on such product in July 1990. This decision followed the assessment of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that the risk of introducing the disease transmissible gastroenteritis through the imports was extremely low. The assessment was objective and scientifically based and was made in the light of Australia, as a major exporter of primary products, maintaining its reputation of not using quarantine restrictions for economic protection purposes. If a quarantine prohibition cannot be based on sound scientific evidence, the prohibition becomes a non-tariff barrier to trade and thus contrary to Australia's international obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a), (b) and (c) A military dog wing was in operation at the School of Military Engineering at Casula, NSW in 1978. The wing was under the command of Captain David Midford-Burgess. Corporal Keith Burley, Sapper Paul McKewan and Sapper Mark Owen were dog handlers in the wing which had an establishment of one officer and fourteen soldiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Several weeks before CHOGM an inspector of the NSW Police telephoned the Commanding Officer of the School of Military Engineering to ask if an explosive detection dog team could be made available during CHOGM. The inspector explained that they could be used to detect letter bombs. As the task involved the pre-planned commitment of military assets, the Inspector was advised that the procedure to obtain approval was to place a request on the Headquarters of the 2nd Military District at Victoria Barracks, Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) The Officer Commanding the Military Dog Wing probably ordered his soldiers to undertake some training related to the possible task. However, this would have been a minor variation on the specified training program. This covered detection of all types of military and commercial explosives in a variety of circumstances such as open areas and buildings, and by day and night. Such training provided a comprehensive basis for tasks such as that envisaged by the NSW Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) It is unlikely that there was dedicated training for the possible task for a full two weeks. It is more likely that it was integrated into the existing training program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The team was highly effective in detecting explosives and capable of detecting a bomb in a garbage bin. However the effectiveness of a handler and dog could be affected by movement and people in the area of operation, excessive heat, darkness, and the general ability of the dog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (d) and (3) (a),(b) and (c) The wing may have been given an order to stand down by the Officer Commanding the Wing. The commanding Officer of the School cannot recall giving such a direction. However, he does not rule out the possibility. It is not known if any explanation was given. Probably, any order given to stand down was because the Police had not followed up their original request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (d) and (e) Any order would have originated from within the School of Military Engineering. Neither the Commanding Officer of the School, nor his Senior Instructor responsible for the training and deployment of the Dog Wing, received any external Army communications on the possible task. Both of these officers would have been aware of a formal tasking or an order to stand down. There were no such instructions given to Army by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. The team was deployed at 2am following the explosion. There was significant confusion when the team arrived. Contact was made with the NSW Police and searches for further bombs were conducted. It is not known if security officers directed areas of search in addition to those chosen by the team, or if the security officers included ASIO personnel.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) I am aware of the concerns of Lavery International Pty Ltd and Murray Goulburn Co- Operative Ltd about the implications for Australian exports of an extension of GSP status by the United States to Hungarian Goya cheese. Goya cheese enters the United States quota-free but is presently subject to a duty of 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Hungary petitioned the US Administration in 1990 for duty-free status for its exports of Goya cheese, under the GSP. That petition was rejected in May of this year. On 12 July, however, in the spirit of supporting economic and political transformation in Eastern Europe, President Bush announced a Trade Enhancement Initiative for Central and Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, which included a review of previously rejected GSP status petitions. This is despite the fact that US regulations dictate a delay of three years before such petitions can be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of the US Special Trade Representative (USTR) will hold public hearings on the granting of GSP status for the products of Central and Eastern European countries, including Hungarian Goya, from 6-8 January 1992, after which post- hearing briefs in favour of, and opposed to, the proposals will be considered. Any modifications to the GSP resulting from this review are expected to be announced on or about 30 April and take effect on or about 1 May 1992. If GSP status is granted, it could also be extended to other GSP suppliers of Goya cheese such as Argentina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">US producers of hard cheeses similar to Goya have been, and remain, strongly opposed to the granting of duty-free status for Hungarian Goya on the basis that it could displace their products. They have mounted an extensive lobbying campaign against the proposal with the Administration and the Congress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) and (5) GSP status is legal under the GATT. While appreciating the sentiment behind the initiative to review the rejected petition, the Government would be concerned if our main competitors were to enjoy a margin of preference of 25 per cent over Australian Goya. Such a development would have a detrimental effect on Australia's exports of Goya to the US market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) As far as I am aware, Australia is the only non-GSP supplier of Goya to the US market. Our concerns about the effect that granting GSP status </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to Hungarian Goya is likely to have on Australian exports have been highlighted with the US Administration in 1990 and, more recently, at the Australia/US Agricultural Trade Consultations in August this year. The Government continues to monitor the situation and will reinforce representations already made as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The only way in which the United States could apply quotas to Goya cheese, consistent with US GATT obligations, would be through Article XIX safeguards or under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Both of these would require the US Government to fulfill specified conditions demonstrating the injurious impact of imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quota would not, in any case, address the problem of a difference in tariff levels between Australian and Hungarian Goya. Instead of maintaining Australia's market share, it would very likely set quantitative limits on imports from Australia and other suppliers at levels lower than the level of imports before the imposition of quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round will see the tarriffication by 1993 of border measures, other than normal customs duties, on agricultural products, and such a result will remove the US Government's option of imposing Section 22 quotas.</PARA>
