<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their concern about the implications of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The petitioners are concerned that the Convention as drafted erodes the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the care of their children and threatens the family unit.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House make appropriate reservations to the Convention prior to ratification in order that the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to their children be protected.</PARA>

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention.</PARA>

Particularly now with the rural downturn, we cannot keep passing our costs onto the grazier so consideration by the government is needed in cutting the fuel costs for the livestock carriers perhaps by an across the board deduction in our fuel tax, and sales tax on all we buy for the business is what we feel is needed to get us all economically sound again.</PARA>

<PARA> Their opposition to the dispatch of three Australian warships to the Middle East, which is part of an unnecessary militarisation of the region, and which contributes to the likelihood of all-out war. The increasing military buildup in the Middle East does not contribute to a resolution of the conflict. The conflict can only be resolved by regionally based diplomatic means.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak for long on this report, but will allow the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who chaired the Subcommittee responsible for the preparation of the report, to lead the debate on the Government's side. Also, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will wish to canvass the issues more fully. I will simply confine my comments to thanking the members involved in the inquiry, particularly the honourable member for Denison, who led this inquiry which started in the life of the last Parliament and continued into this Parliament, and also the right honourable member for New England, who took a very keen interest in the Committee's proceedings and in the taking of evidence. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) also took a very keen interest in the proceedings.

<PARA> I believe that it is a very comprehensive study of the legal regimes which apply in Australia's territories. Those territories, which basically comprise Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island, as well as the uninhabited territories, all have a quite distinct history and the problems facing them are unique to each of those territories. Despite that, the Committee was guided by certain underlying principles, I suppose the most important of which was that the citizens of these territories are Australian citizens and, as such, deserve equal rights and equal status in terms of their position under the law and their position in relation to the ability to vote. It is important that the reforms in this Committee's report be adopted and I am hopeful that the Government will consider the report seriously and act upon it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Territories Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I join the Chairman, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), in commending to honourable members the Committee's report entitled Islands in the Sun. The report presents the Committee's findings and recommendations in relation to its inquiry into the adequacy of the legal regimes of Australia's external territories and the Jervis Bay territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its report the Committee has responded to years of legislative inactivity in respect of external territories, the exception being Norfolk Island, with which I will deal separately. The Committee has recommended sweeping changes to the basis of the respective legal regimes of the territories. Law-making for the external territories has been spasmodic, has received a very low priority and has essentially been in response to particular crises or circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the time has come for decisive action by the Commonwealth in order to guarantee the residents of the territories, particularly Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an acceptable level of legal protection and similar rights, privileges and benefits as are generally enjoyed by Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming body of evidence provided to the Committee and the conclusions drawn from its observations during visits to the territories reveals the existence, in respect of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, of situations where, as a result of non-existent or patently inadequate laws, Australian citizens are being denied basic human rights and scant protection under the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth legislative inactivity in these territories has spawned legal regimes which bring no credit to Australia and which have the potential to cause it international embarrassment. For example, the Committee received evidence from the Federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands that the Commission regards certain breaches by Australia of obligations accepted under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights in respect of the residents of these territories as-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . extremely serious violations of basic human rights which cannot be permitted to continue. </PARA>
<PARA>The evidence of those charged with the responsibility for law and order and the administration of justice on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands also provides a stark profile of the degree to which Australian tenets of justice have been denied to the residents of those territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director of Public Prosecutions describes the criminal law of the territories, rooted as it is in a 1950s time jam, as `idiosyncratic'. He also notes that it departs considerably from accepted practice within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice French, of the Federal Court of Australia, expostulated in obvious frustration that the `affairs of Cocos (Keeling) Islands are regulated by a system of law which is Byzantine in its complexity'. The Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia notes that the Commonwealth's obligation to provide a legal service to the territories, in accordance with its obligations under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, has not prevented it from being derelict in not accepting either its moral or legal duty to provide such services. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of laws to regulate commercial activity and the non-application of the International Labor Organisation conventions on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are the ingredients of a deep anguish and frustration in the residents of those territories. The long delays in addressing the administrative and legal infrastructure of the territories, while nevertheless proceeding with laws, for example, to implement international arrangements for the protection of migratory birds, led to the plaintive but haunting cry from the heart from the Cocos Islands Cooperative Society to the Committee, that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . surely workers deserve legislative treatment of the same level of birds. To add insult to injury, in 1988, additional legislation was enacted for migratory birds. Currently the Commonwealth funds the position of a conservator and his assistant, but in relation to workers compensation and accompanied health and safety matters, the workers trail far behind the birds'. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to the weight of the damning evidence before it, the Committee has developed a raft of recommendations designed to ensure that the legal regimes and administrative structures of each of the external territories are reformed quickly and effectively. There are aspects of the administration of these external territories which have generated, during the course of the inquiry, the epithet `national disgrace'. This is a situation which cannot, in this Committee's view, be allowed to persist. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to each of the territories under review. The Committee's primary recommendation in relation to Ashmore and Cartier Islands is that that uninhabited Territory be incorporated into the Northern Territory. The Committee accepts that the amalgamation of Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the Northern Territory would formalise the de facto legal and administrative nexus between the two territories. The legal regime of both Ashmore and Cartier Islands is based on the law of the Northern Territory and, to a large measure, administered by officials of the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has not identified any overriding policy, legal or foreign affairs reasons for retaining Ashmore and Cartier as a separate Territory. On the contrary, Ashmore and Cartier's status as a separate and distinct territory serves no logical purpose and is administratively burdensome. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the inhabited territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the Committee has recommended, following close and specific consultation with the residents of those territories, that the law of Western Australia, as amended from time to time, be extended to those territories to replace the currently applied law, in so far as that law has not been developed as a response to a specific or unique particular circumstance of the territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Committee's recom- mendation for the incorporation of Ashmore and Cartier into the Northern Territory, the Committee has recommended that the feasibility of the eventual inclusion of both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands within the State of Western Australia be explored by the Commonwealth with the Government of Western Australia. Such an outcome is an acknowledgment of the strong links between the territories and Western Australia and is designed to rationalise the anomaly present in the existence of these small island outposts as separate jurisdictional entities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has identified a number of particular aspects of the generally deficient legal regimes of the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands in respect of which action should be initiated without delay. These recommendations are concerned with overcoming breaches of human rights, the provision of a formal legal aid service, the application of International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions to the territories, reform of the criminal law and a review of the title, functions and powers of the administrator of the territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also urged the vigorous application of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act as a mechanism for ensuring the continued environmental protection of the islands. The need for environmental protection of the uninhabited Coral Sea Islands Territory was a major focus of the Committee's attention in respect of that Territory. The Committee has recommended that an assessment be undertaken of the feasibility of declaring the whole of the Territory and surrounding waters a park or reserve under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommends that the Commonwealth institute discussions with the Queensland Government in relation to the application and administration of the laws of Queensland in the Territory and the possible incorporation of the Territory within Queensland. The Coral Sea Islands are currently administered in accordance with the laws of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which, over time, will become increasingly inappropriate. The Jervis Bay Territory is likewise subject to the laws of the ACT in so far as they are applicable to that Territory. Jervis Bay is administered, by arrangement with the Commonwealth, by the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the ACT Government is not concerned with or responsible for the effect of its legislation in Jervis Bay. While it is the aim of ACT officials charged with responsibility for administering Jervis Bay to ensure the continuation of the range and level of services which Jervis Bay residents enjoyed before self-government, the administrative difficulties associated with administering Jervis Bay from a distance and continually assessing the suitability of ACT laws and their application in Jervis Bay has lead the Committee to explore alternative arrangements for its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has accordingly recommended that the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments explore the desirability of applying New South Wales law in Jervis Bay as well as giving consideration to the eventual incorporation of Jervis Bay within the State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that in the interim consideration be given to the Shoalhaven City Council being charged with the responsibility for the administration of the Territory. The Shoalhaven City Council already administers the area surrounding the Territory and stands ready to accept responsibility for the administration of Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these recommendations the Committee acknowledges that their acceptance is subject to maintenance of the paramount rights of the Aboriginal community of Wreck Bay and to recognition of the Commonwealth's defence and environmental and conservation interests in Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's consideration of the legal regime of the long-settled territory of Norfolk Island was based on an understanding and acknowledgment of the Island's distinctive history, the degree of self-government achieved and the strength of Norfolk Island's economic base. The Committee is, however, conscious of the Commonwealth's responsibility and duty in ensuring that the residents of Norfolk Island enjoy the same basic rights and protection as other Australians. The Committee has been generally satisfied with the nature of the legal regime of Norfolk Island. There are nevertheless aspects of the administration of the territory in respect of which the Committee has urged that action be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps most significantly, the Committee has recommended that Norfolk Island residents should not be denied the right to vote in elections for the Commonwealth Parliament. The Committee is mindful of strong opposition within sections of the Norfolk Island community to attachment of Norfolk Island to an Australian electorate. (Extension of time granted) The Committee's strong and unanimous view, however, is that no Australian citizen wishing to exercise his or her right to vote can be legitimately denied that fundamental right. The Committee recommends, therefore, that residents of Norfolk Island who are Australian citizens should have the right to optional enrolment. In addition, the Committee has recommended that it become in future an eligibility requirement for Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly elections that only Australian citizens be able to stand and vote in such elections. Such a recommendation is consistent with practice and policy in relation to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> Social services on Norfolk Island are provided by the Norfolk Island Government in accordance with the Norfolk Island Social Services Act 1980. The range and level of benefits available have been designed to meet local circumstances. The Committee has no reason to believe that adequate benefits and services are not provided to the people of Norfolk Island. We have recommended, however, that the Commonwealth Grants Commission undertake a review of the living standards, social security provisions, and economic base of Norfolk Island because we believe that only with detailed and specific analysis of these issues can the Commonwealth be confident that the rights of all residents are being safeguarded on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In making our recommendations, the Committee has responded to the substantive evidence before it. The report reflects a wide body of opinion that was canvassed during the inquiry, including extensive consultations undertaken by the Committee in each of the inhabited territories. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank my fellow Subcommittee members for the time and effort they devoted to the inquiry. During this Parliament they were the honourable member for Fisher, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is a country of many islands. That island on which this Parliament meets and where most of us live, is, of course, better known than some of those more distant from us. This report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, for all its romantic title, actually addresses the future stability and possibilities for other islands that are part of our Australian nation-islands that most Australians will never visit, islands about which few even know their geography or their location. Nonetheless, the people on them are as much the responsibility of members of this Parliament as are the residents of the mainland of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For that reason I wanted, in addressing this matter, to commend the report that has been presented by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch)-so ably seconded by the Chairman of the Subcommittee, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) in this debate this morning-to the attention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Few Ministers have visited the islands. Few know of the problems and concerns of the people of the territories. Like most, their present is largely predicated on their past. As with the approach of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to running the economy, there has been a Micawber-like attitude by successive governments to the problems of the territories, a feeling that something will turn up. Regrettably, as with the Treasurer's involvement in trying to give some hope to ordinary Australians, I am afraid that unless something more is done with the territories I do not think anything will turn up. The valid criticism that the evidence given to the Committee reflects, of abuses of human rights, of neglect of International Labour Organisation conventions and of a byzantine complexity in the legal system applicable to these territories, will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that I think all of us have got to accept is that Australia is not a colonial power. We do not look on these territories as colonies; they are not and will not be. In no way does anybody on the mainland of Australia see these territories as being other than part of Australia. If they are part of Australia, we have a responsibility, as members of this Parliament, and the Government, as members of the Government, to give those within those territories the same opportunities and the same legal status accorded to other citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three aspects of the administration of the territories that concern me. The first is the economy. Most of them are monocultured. We have a nonsensical idea of trying to promote a casino on Christmas Island. I say nonsensical because that is not going to resolve the problems of the island. Christmas Island was largely developed around its phosphate resource. It is running out, and there has been an attempt through a cooperative to restore that as another extension of the economic life of the island. Frankly, tourism is one of the ways by which Christmas Island can get an extension into the future. With regard to each of these territories, tourism is a way by which they can extend their income, but within each of them there is a critical shortfall in economic opportunities. There are problems for young people, and hence a movement by people of these territories back to the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to understand that this report does not address those economic issues. I think they are complex and significant and need to be addressed by the Government. I know that at the moment there is a memorandum of understanding that the Minister with responsibility for territories has, apparently, at least in a draft stage, initialled, with the Cocos Malay community of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. That, alone, is not going to solve the economic problems of their future development. I say to the Government that those economic issues are important and need to be addressed, but unless it accepts the recommendations of this report and implements for each of these territories a reasonable legal regime, the economic solutions are going to be more difficult to attain. </PARA>
<PARA> While addressing that matter, can I also say that on each of these islands, and indeed on islands everywhere, the environment is sensitive. It is fragile and, in any development, one needs to be concerned that we do not prejudice the character and nature of those islands. </PARA>
<PARA> I want briefly to address each of these territories and say something about them. Essentially, in the report what is suggested-what is valid and sensible and the only way to address the legal systems-is to make each of these territories as far as possible part of the legal system of the Australian States. We have a federal system. The laws of the States address the general framework required to protect the rights and obligations of citizens and, in those circumstances, it has been suggested that each of the territories be progressively integrated to a greater or lesser extent within the respective Australian States. Ashmore and Cartier Islands, we suggest, be immediately made part of the Northern Territory and Jervis Bay be immediately part of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Cocos, Christmas and Norfolk Islands, we suggest that Cocos and Christmas Island, to a different extent, be part of Western Australia and that Norfolk Island adopt, but not become part of, New South Wales law, with a different time period and status to be applied in each case. Ashmore and Cartier Islands and Jervis Bay are in quite different situations from each of the other territories. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison, identified, as far as Jervis Bay is concerned, it is really an anachronistic Commonwealth territory. It is there simply because in days gone by when the ACT was established it was said that it was felt necessary for the ACT to have a port. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I should record that this work is in no substantive way a result of efforts on my behalf and that it is appropriate to pay tribute to the work of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs under its Chairman in the previous Parliament, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), and those people who served on the Committee-particularly the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) who, I understand, did a great deal of work and was prepared to go back and help wrap it up even though he was no longer on the Committee after the change of membership when this Parliament came into being last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments about this matter. I refer to the contribution made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) in September last year when this report was initially tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of introduction, I record my concern that the honourable member was able to refer to the indictment that the report constitutes concerning the lack of coordination and the pattern that exists in dealings between Aboriginal communities and State and Federal governments. He pointed out that in terms of some projects undertaken by Aboriginal communities there was a need for those communities to deal with up to 18 government and semi-government bodies, which obviously would be a daunting prospect even for sophisticated and well-educated members of the community, let alone for many Aboriginal communities which are only just enjoying reasonable access to education and these sorts of facilities and which are still trying to find their way around them to make them work to their own advantage. This question of the effective funding and coordination of programs for Aboriginal communities leads me to chapter 8 of the report, which particularly interests me, entitled `Accountability'. I think that the introduction to the chapter is worth recording in the House and I will do so. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The sizeable amount of public funding to Aboriginal communities necessarily entails a high degree of public accountability. Aboriginal communities and organisations have had varying degrees of success with accountability for public funding and have tended to attract publicity when breakdowns occur. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee referred to these problems in its previous report, A Chance for the Future, noting that problems continue in the management of Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 8.2 the report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee pointed to poor financial management and the non-compliance with grant conditions as evidence of this but was critical of government agencies for failing to provide Aboriginal organisations and communities with the support that would allow them to handle their responsibilities. It urged the Commonwealth and States to fund jointly training packages and programs in community management, financial management, administration and development to promote the development of skills in communities. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that to talk about accountability is in fact to talk about responsibility as well. It seems to me that responsibility is a vital prerequisite of freedom-the sort of freedom that this report obviously paints as being desirable for Aboriginals and Aboriginal communities. Surely, the very need for Aboriginal people to enjoy the sorts of things that we take for granted in our community-which really flows from our belonging to a very fortunate and lucky community-will require Aboriginals increasingly to take on board more responsibility for their own destiny. It seems to me to be impossible to have freedom without first setting guidelines for responsibility and behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply concerned that we have not fully grappled with this need for Aboriginal communities to, on the one hand, accept responsibility in return for greater freedom and, on the other hand, be encouraged by us to embrace that responsibility and learn how to use it. The sorts of freedoms that we look to to enable people to make reasonable life choices, which I guess result from fair access to opportunities, require the exercise of responsibility and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look around my own electorate I see some very real problem areas which reflect what I am talking about. In one town a very substantial amount of money-well in excess of $1m-was made available to an Aboriginal community for the purpose of building an aged hostel. Problems emerged very rapidly because, as the community put it to me, it was given no guidelines at all as to how to draw down the funding. The people were certainly given no guidelines as to the procedures by which they might call for tenders and the procedures by which they might select suitable designs from those which were put to them. They were given no guidelines as to how to lock themselves into the process of beginning the construction of a building and continuing the reviewing process and the payment process, which is also very important lest an unscrupulous or wobbly building company take them down. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sense, I say that we failed. There is a need to provide those people with effective guidelines and parameters within which they can exercise the ongoing development of their communities. They were lucky, in that instance, that the local council and members thereof stepped into the breach and provided the guidelines and the guidance that the initiators of the grant appeared to have not come forward with. </PARA>
<PARA> I can think of another town where there is a community which is now complaining in no uncertain terms because the people there no longer have mail delivery or garbage collection. This is an instance where the community itself must take on board the need to respond to its own Aboriginal leaders who are calling for that community to show more responsibility in the way it treats people who deliver mail and collect garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have more than used my time on that point. I commend the report for its overall thrust and hope that the Government will take effective note of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as a current member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, and Chairman of the Government's Caucus committee on Aboriginal affairs, I am certainly pleased to be able to speak in support of the advances for the Aboriginal people as highlighted in the report Our Future, Our Selves. I would also like to pay tribute to the work done by the Committee in the previous Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most important recognitions made in the report was that the Aborigines had their own way of running communities long before the arrival of Europeans just over 200 years ago. Together with the report A Chance for the Future which preceded Our Future, Our Selves these studies into Aboriginal communities make it clear that there has been insufficient effort in marrying the Government's policies of Aboriginal self-determination and self-management with appropriate planning and management mechanisms to ensure that Aboriginal and Islander people have the means to control what they desire in their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA> To further the track towards self-determination and self-management, it is important that we remain mindful of the definition of these ideals. In the original report A Chance for the Future the Committee considered the essence of self-determination to be the devolution of political and economic power to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In a nutshell, this means Aboriginal people having the resources and the capacity to control the future of their own communities within the legal structure common to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the equation, self-management is concerned with the efficient management and administration of Aboriginal communities and organisations. I commend the Committee for its progress towards these aims which are seen in the report's identification of the need for policies of self-determination and self-management to enable Aboriginal communities to define their social, economic and cultural goals; to facilitate the provision of the range of services which community members want; to control and manage community infrastructure and facilities; to increase their self-sufficiency both economically and in terms of having less reliance on outside personnel; and to liaise and negotiate with government and other agencies which provide services to them. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we must remain realistic in looking towards these laudable aims, and this point has not been missed by the Committee in its identification of those impediments. One of the most fundamental of those identified is the problem associated with the concept of community among Aboriginal people in terms of its use as the basis for funding Aboriginal community control, management and development. This is quite understandable when we consider that many of the former settlements, reserves and missions were artificial communities, having been created for the purpose of non-Aboriginal administrative convenience, rather than as distinctly Aboriginal communities more in line with traditional Aboriginal social organisation, beliefs and interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Factionalism caused by the proliferation of community based organisations or incorporated bodies is another problem identified in the report which governments need to be mindful of when determining how to achieve the goals of self-determination and self-management. The Committee is right in citing the splintering of Aboriginal effort that is being caused by the dominance of groups within communities through its creation of the potential for duplication between respective organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The report claims that one of the dangers of having an abundance of organisations is that authority in the community may become splintered to the point where an astute community leader can play one faction off against another to the adviser's advantage. This is a lesson applicable to any community aim, and history has shown it has clearly retarded Aboriginal causes in the past. There is also the question of conflicts with Aboriginal values, a problem more complicated than just the presence of different groupings in communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that have come out of the report are of merit and will do much to facilitate many of the findings of the Committee's two initial reports. The recommendations cover many issues impacting upon Aboriginal people, ranging from general principles to specific issues such as women, a greater emphasis on coordination of services, funding accountability, community advisers and community-based staff and resource agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the recommendations which I believe will make for quicker and, at the same time, more sustainable implementation of the Committee's findings is the major thrust to replace the current process of consultation with Aboriginal communities with one more orientated to negotiation. This demonstrates the Committee's due regard for some of the community difficulties to which I alluded previously, something which I will be pleased to uphold as a member of the present Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As a member of the previous House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and a member of the Subcommittee appointed in this Parliament to complete the report, I rise to speak on the report, Our Future, Our Selves. It was a great pleasure to be involved with both groups. Other speakers have covered many of the major issues of the report such as the need for negotiation to replace the process of consultation and the need for greater coordination in the provision of services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to focus on the issue of funding-a very important aspect of this report. The improvements in coordination mechanisms recommended by the Committee should reduce the wastage currently incurred through poor coordination. However, the Committee believes that Aboriginal communities should be given greater control over the management of the funds provided; that was a point which came out many times. We recommend implementing a system of block grant funding of Aboriginal communities and organisations with a minimum level of funding provided on a triennial basis. This will improve the flexibility and certainty of community funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The improvement of the economic base of Aboriginal communities and organisations is an important objective. One area where Aboriginal communities frequently miss out is in participation in contract work in and around their community. While having the skills and equipment to undertake such work, they are frequently unaware that contracts are being let or they find out too late. The Committee has recommended procedures to better facilitate their participation and provide feedback when a tender is unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> The report endorses greater support for those community enterprises with clear potential to generate additional income and employment within the community. The importance of training for enterprise involvement is also strongly stressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular concern are the infrastructure and resource deficiencies in Aboriginal communities. The Committee recommends greater recognition of these deficiencies by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments such that communities be allowed to carry overfunding where necessary without prejudice to their level of funding-a very important point that needs to be stressed. This will encourage the undertaking of longer term projects and avoid the situation where unspent funds have to be spent before the end of the financial year or lost to the community. This can lead to unnecessary or wasteful expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> Hand in hand with improved funding arrangements should be improved accountability. At present the piecemeal funding for Aboriginal communities is accompanied by piecemeal accounting requirements. One project may be part funded by several agencies, each with a different set of reporting requirements. This is a wasteful approach and the Committee has recommended that as a matter of urgency the Commonwealth develop uniform accounting procedures for grants to communities and organisations. We further believe that all government agencies negotiate with funded communities the development of appropriate performance indicators for programs. Performance monitoring and assessment mechanisms should have significant Aboriginal input; that was one aspect that came out over and over again in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The accounting and financial reporting capacities of Aboriginal communities and organisations should be strengthened by providing sufficient funding for this function and by assisting them to develop simple but efficient accounting and financial reporting systems-an absolute necessity. Obviously, the availability of appropriate training for bookkeepers and other administrative staff in communities is absolutely essential. The Committee has recommended the development and implementation of such courses. That point needs to be underlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the implementation of the recommendations of this report will see a major improvement in the self-determination and self-management of communities, not to mention their self-esteem. I commend the report to the House and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) and ask that the Minister avoid the history of Aboriginal Affairs committee reports not being responded to by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important report recommending significant changes to improve services available to Aboriginal communities. It was tabled in September last year, and I believe that the Government should inform the House of its response in the near future. Indeed, the procedures concerned with these reports require the Minister to respond to the House within three months. I thank Mr Allan Kelly and other members of the Committee secretariat for the excellent work that was done in preparing a very good report. </PARA>

It is an excellent report, and I am pleased to be able to speak on it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report deals with some very important issues that are crucial to the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Islander communities. One of the major thrusts of the report, as mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), is that the process of negotiation should replace the current process of consultation that occurs with Aboriginal communities. It has been apparent, and this report stresses it throughout, that the consultation process has been largely ineffective and has not been based on genuine dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA> As practised, consultation has been a process where, after varying lengths of discussion, views from outside have still been imposed upon Aboriginal people. The Committee has recommended that the process should be one of negotiation when government and other agencies deal with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The negotiation process is necessary if real meaning is to be given to the policy of self-determination. As noted in the report, negotiation more closely accords with traditional decision making processes as practised by Aboriginal and Islander people. It will require definite changes in approach for government and other agencies to avoid putting undue pressure on Aboriginal people to achieve a predetermined decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great diversity amongst Aboriginal and Islander communities and people. They must be allowed to develop their own goals and priorities. This does not always fit in with some bureaucratic expectations of a uniform approach. However, the Committee found that there needs to be a fundamental change in the relationship between government agencies and Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> The report stresses one other important issue. The Committee made special reference in the report to the needs of Aboriginal women because it believes their views are not always sought or taken into account. Consultation has largely been conducted by white males and Aboriginal women. Where Aboriginal women have actually been consulted, they have often been shy and reluctant to make their needs known. Even where the views of women have been crucial in determining whether particular services will meet the needs of the community, they have not been adequately consulted. Aboriginal women are reluctant to speak freely in mixed groups of whites and Aboriginal men--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with the report presented to this House some time ago called The Stamp of Approval, which reviews the philatelic sales section of Australia Post and also deals with some recommendations on that area by the Auditor-General. Firstly, I find the Auditor-General's report sloppy, inept and lacking in any sense of commercial judgment and any knowledge of the subject matter with which it deals. It is a prescription for destroying what has been a major source of income for Australia Post by seeking to double charge for services not provided by Australia Post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major complaint I have in that area is the Auditor-General's recommendation that philatelic services, the central philatelic agency, should charge a fee in addition to the cost of the philatelic item in order to recover the full cost of providing that philatelic item. It sounds good to someone with no business acumen and probably no necessity to carry out the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 10 years philatelic items put out by Australia Post have grown to such volumes that most people no longer collect a great deal of them because of the physical problems of finding another house to store them. We have an issue every three weeks. Instead of having one stamp, we have se-tenants, we have prepaid envelopes, and now we have maxi-cards. The physical volume of this material is great, and, for those who are genuine in wanting to keep their collection in a proper condition, providing adequate storage is extremely costly. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in the submission I made to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, a first day cover costs Australia Post nothing other than the cost of actually putting the stamps on an envelope, providing the envelope-for which Australia Post charges-and having someone stamping it. The cost is very little. The stamps themselves represent a fee paid in advance for a service that Australia Post is not required to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular first day cover that I mentioned cost $4.10, so collectors have paid $4.10 for $4.10 worth of postal services which they have forgone because they are collectors. The Auditor-General suggests that on top of that another fee should be charged for delivering that material. Philately is the most profitable area of operation in Australia Post, so it is hardly a loss area, yet it is one which is declining, so Australia Post will have to find genuine ways of making money. The Auditor-General suggests that the matter should be dealt with by providing an additional fee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years the quantity of philatelic material sold by Australia Post has declined rapidly. It has to be said in fairness that it has done so in most countries of the world. The reason is similar in all cases. First of all, there were the stamp agencies which got on the bandwagon in the 1980s, made fortunes, and wrecked the economies of some countries which had had a reasonable, steady income from philately. Those agencies exploited the stamp issues for a couple of years for a quick quid. One such agency, the Kenny agency, even got involved in the elections in the Cook Islands, paying to transport people from New Zealand to the Cook Islands in order to vote for a particular government which, it thought, would allow it to exploit the stamp issues more than the incoming government would. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Australia Post is concerned, I have to express very serious concerns about the manner in which it has managed its philatelic services and, more importantly, the lack of security and integrity of the stamp issue itself. If, for instance, genuine errors are made in the printing of stamps, they become philatelic items. In one area of stamps, the George V stamps, the stereotype we had for 20-odd years, there are more errors than anyone could imagine, but they are genuine and continuing errors and they came out through post offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Today people can go to any philatelic auction and find a myriad of material which has never been over a post office counter, but has come out the back door of post offices or security printers-and I do not know which-selling at very high prices in order to exploit a market. Australia Post, like the note issue branch and the Australian Mint, has responsibilities to protect the integrity of the product it sells, especially where the product can have value added to it by errors or mistakes. There will always be some errors, but the contrived errors and the fact that almost every issue contains an error suggest that the security and integrity of the stamp issue system is not good.</PARA>
<PARA> For many years people who have purchased philatelic material-not all of them collectors-have supported Australia Post and enabled it to balance its budget. In return, they have been ripped off and cheated, and now there is a suggestion that they should be charged for the privilege of paying money to Australia Post for a service that they do not get. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General suggests that is a good idea. I think we ought to have an audit into the Auditor-General's office, because he has written many reports which are great in theory and probably come out of university textbooks but which have nothing to do with commercial operations and certainly nothing to do with the reality of a commercial world. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), who is coming into the chamber, once reported on another aspect of the Auditor-General's activities in rather strident terms. Incompetence was hardly the word, but it was accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that we have here-and I am more concerned that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has suggested that he is prepared to accept some of these recommendations-a prescription for reducing materially the income of Australia Post through trying to rip off yet another 10c or 15c from those people who continue to be loyal to Australia Post, and that is not many. Most of the genuine collectors in Australia have long ceased collecting Australian stamps because they do not trust Australia Post, which does not provide a service, and the stamp issue itself is a disgrace to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Stamp issue is commercialised to such an extent that it no longer reflects well on Australia. We used to have a very good reputation in the area of stamp issue. We still have an opportunity to provide material which reflects Australia and Australian values. Instead of that, we print material where the priority is to meet some narrow need for quick revenue. We cannot even rely on that material standing up to examination into the future because half of it is going to slip out of the back door. I had the misfortune on one occasion to advise Australia Post of material-cancelled order material-in full sheets an inch thick being traded in the philatelic market. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of Australian postage stamps has reached the stage where current postage stamps can be bought in the philatelic market for under 70c on the dollar. That is the value that the commercial world places on our philatelic services. There are very few stamps-probably not one in 10 of issues in the last 10 years-which can return to a collector the value originally paid for them. That is not a very good reputation for a country which once had a very substantial reputation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the report has missed the point. As I said, the Auditor-General's report is sloppy and inept and reflects a total lack of any commercial knowledge. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his response to that report, because it is a response to an incompetent report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We bring the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill on for two main reasons. The first is that it follows the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill which was debated in October 1990. The Government allowed just two hours for that debate which really addressed the question of the part privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. The deal was worth $1.6 billion but concerned only 30 per cent privatisation of the bank. There was at that time no opportunity to debate the nine amendments that the coalition brought forward, three of which we felt were very important, and this Bill really seeks to deal with those three amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reason for the Bill is the developments that have occurred in the Australian banking industry. For example, the State Bank of South Australia has collapsed and the National Australia Bank has announced a $1 billion issue, and we believe that merits further review of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is now being governed by half measures by a half-hearted administration. The Hawke Government's attitude to privatisation is a half-baked half measure. The attempt to partly privatise the Commonwealth Bank is typical of a government that has lost its way. By partly privatising the bank the Government will finish up with the worst of both worlds. The Government does not understand that the real purpose of privatisation is not to assist the Budget arithmetic with one-off sales; it is to lower costs to the community and to improve services and competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition wants full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank to achieve these objectives. Our disastrous balance of payments and investment figures make such reforms mandatory. We should be embarking on a wholesale program of privatisation of government business enterprises and micro-economic reform. Instead, the Government is dabbling around the edges of our problems with these half measures. It is clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have lost the capacity to plot a firm course and stick to it. The Opposition's program of privatisation will provide an important boost to Australia's productivity and commercial efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has three objectives. The first is to remove the prohibition limiting private shareholding to 30 per cent-and that raises the question of why we are calling for privatisation at all. There are a number of reasons why the Opposition wants privatisation. There are some things that governments should do and some things that they should not do. Given that there is a healthy private sector in banking, one thing the Government should not do is get involved in the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank will provide benefits to the consumers in terms of competition with lower prices and better services. It will provide good employee participation and a wide spread of ownership, prevent the Government from injecting more money into the Commonwealth Bank and so help our debt situation, and mean increased efficiency and better productivity performance. There will be flow-on benefits, with less government, more effective capital markets and lower debt from the proceeds of sales. That is why we seek the removal of the 30 per cent limit on private ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objective of the Bill is to make the shareholdings of the bank subject to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, as is the case for all other companies. Other banks and companies are subject to that Act, and we believe the Commonwealth Bank should be too. The third objective of the Bill is to make shareholdings of the Bank, as are the shareholdings of all other banks, subject to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals outlined in the Bill will lead to the full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and benefits to bank consumers around Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its deep concern about the current situation in Tibet;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) recognises that human rights abuses have been committed in Tibet by the People's Republic of China since 1959 and that human rights abuses are reportedly continuing;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) endorses Resolutions No. 1353 of 1959, No. 1723 of 1961 and No. 2079 of 1965 of the UN General Assembly and recognises that they remain relevant today;</PARA>

<PARA> (7) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of China to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognise the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Human Rights Covenants, including the right to practise their cultural and religious traditions without fear of persecution, arrest or torture;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) enter into earnest discussions, without preconditions, with the Dalai Lama and his representatives with a view to reducing the tensions in Tibet; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) respond to representations made by the Australian Government and by members of this Parliament on allegations on human rights abuses and the human rights situation in general in Tibet; and</PARA>
<PARA> (8) calls on the Australian Government to continue to make representations to, and seek responses from, the Government of the People's Republic of China on allegations of human rights abuses in Tibet. </PARA>
<PARA>The tenth of March will be the thirty-second anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising day. Thirty-two years ago on that day in 1959, the Tibetan people of Lhasa revolted against the Chinese. They were brutally suppressed by the military authorities. It is claimed that just in that period some 87,000 Tibetans died in the massacre that followed. Most of the men in Lhasa were taken away and sent to labour camps and many have never returned. But the 10 March uprising is only one outward mark of a people's resistance to a brutal annexation of their nation by a larger neighbour. The annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in October of 1950 has not been legitimised by the harshness of their rule and their attempts to suppress the centuries old culture of that people. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Tibetan nation is not one of persistent control by China. Its history is recounted by Dr Ken Gardiner, a senior lecturer in the Asian Histories Centre, Department of Asian Studies at the Australian National University, in an essay in the Australia Tibet Council News of November-December 1990. In this essay he sets out the long history of both Tibet and China remaining as independent and equal nations. For example, he points out that:</PARA>
<PARA>Tibet first enters Chinese history as a powerful and aggressive kingdom whose hostility the T'ang dynasty in China sought, generally unsuccessfully, to contain. These were the days when Buddhism was first being introduced into Tibet and before its influence became paramount there. For a time the power of Tibet extended well beyond its present boundaries into much of Central Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Gardiner then recounts the days in which the histories of China and Tibet ran separately as parallel nation states with their mutual domination for some period by the Mongol powers and the association that Tibet has with Mongolia, through its religious affiliations. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the relationship, China and Tibet became more closely associated in 1644, when the fifth Dalai Lama arrived in Peking to visit the new, rising Manchu dynasty. It is plain that there was no suggestion of subordination; in fact the visit was welcomed by the Chinese authorities who were treating the Dalai Lama `with all the ceremony that would have been accorded to any independent sovereign, and nothing can be found'-says Dr Gardiner-`to indicate that he was looked upon in any other light'. </PARA>
<PARA> The period where China, in fact, exercised for the first time substantial hegemony over Lhasa and Tibet was in 1720 when a Manchu army entered Lhasa for the first time and imposed its own nominee as Dalai Lama, with the eventual installation of a Manchu resident to keep Tibetan affairs under surveillance and a Manchu garrison in the city. But, as Dr Gardiner says in conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus we see that the first take-over of Tibet by a regime based in China, although it antedates the Chinese communist intervention, still belongs to comparatively recent times, to much the same period as that when various European nations imposed colonial rule on so many parts of the world. Chinese rule in Tibet has no more historical or cultural justification than European colonial rule in India, South-east Asia or elsewhere. Yet, whereas the former European colonies have almost everywhere acquired independence, Chinese rule in Tibet still survives, a complete anachronism in the world of the late twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA>Some might say that that account by Dr Gardiner is interesting but is simply a historical diversion. </PARA>
<PARA> Aside from these political questions, which are of great importance, there are extremely grave instances of abuses of human rights which need to be dealt with simply on their own terms. David Lucas, a Victorian lawyer, writing in the December 1990 Australian Law News, has recounted some of these abuses. I note the points made by David Lucas in that article:</PARA>
<PARA>China's violation of Tibet's territorial integrity was denounced as aggression by virtually all states of the free world. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he accounts for the abuses:</PARA>
<PARA>About 1.2 million Tibetans have died as a result of the Chinese occupation-about one-sixth of the Tibetan population; 7.5 million Chinese colonists have already moved into Tibet, outnumbering the six million native Tibetans;</PARA>
<PARA>Over 6,000 monasteries, temples and historic structures have been systematically looted and destroyed in an apparent attempt to annihilate Tibet's religion and culture;</PARA>
<PARA>One out of ten Tibetans have been held in prisons or forced labour camps for periods of 10 to 20 years. Most were beaten and tortured. Today, 3,000-4,000 Tibetans (including 300 monks) remain in captivity for `anti-state' activities;</PARA>
<PARA>Forced abortions and sterilisation of Tibetan women is common. Official radio broadcasts from Lhasa proudly boast of the large number of young Tibetan women who have `volunteered' to be sterilised;</PARA>
<PARA>Tibet is a vast military base, holding some 300,000 troops, and one quarter of China's 350 nuclear missiles. It is also a nuclear waste dumping ground;</PARA>
<PARA>The capital, Lhasa, has been transformed-the `Tibetan' part of the city has shrunk to 2 per cent as the city is transformed into a modern commercial Chinese city. Indeed, the re-modelling of the town suggests that it has been designed for better and easier `crowd control' and the dwindling `Tibetan' character gives weight to the argument that the Tibetans are a minority in their own land;</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, David Lucas makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA>The reports of February 1989 and March 1990 of Amnesty International suggest that flagrant abuses of human rights continue; The Age of 23 May 1990 carried reports of some 2,000 people being killed in the six months prior to the lifting of martial law. </PARA>
<PARA>These are accounts that should give rise to grave concern, and of course they have done so. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two reflections of the world's concern. The first was the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, who has continued to press for a non-violent solution to the troubles that afflict his people. Equally, there still remain three crucial resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The first, passed in 1959 following the Chinese occupation of Tibet, noted the distinctive cultural and religious heritage of the people of Tibet and the autonomy they had traditionally enjoyed and called for respect for their fundamental human rights and for their distinctive cultural and religious life. </PARA>
<PARA> That resolution was followed in 1961 by resolution 1723, which recalled the earlier resolution 1353 and noted with deep anxiety the severe hardships which the events had inflicted on the Tibetan people, as evidenced by the large scale exodus of Tibetan refugees. The resolution went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Considering that these events violate fundamental human rights and freedoms set out in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the principles of self-determination of peoples and nations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It called again on the Chinese Government to cease the practices which deprived the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, including their rights to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in 1965 the General Assembly again reasserted its grave concern at the continued violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Tibet, deplored those continued violations and declared its conviction that the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Tibet and the suppression of the distinctive cultural and religious life of its peoples increased international tension and embittered relations between peoples. It appealed to all states to use their best endeavours to achieve the purposes of the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Today this House has before it a motion which seeks to ensure that those calls remain as relevant today as they were when first made by the United Nations General Assembly. The motion asks this House to support a call to the Government of Australia to continue to make representations to and to seek responses from the Government of the People's Republic of China on these allegations of human rights abuses in Tibet and to intervene to ensure that those tragedies can be set aside and put behind us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would urge all members of this House to support this motion, which is in similar terms to one passed in the Senate unanimously by all parties and all members of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and I thank the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for allowing me to do so. I am conscious that the time for these debates is severely constrained and I will try to contain my remarks to the time that has been agreed upon. The motion is one that was very carefully drafted. I think it is conscious of the difficulties that Australian governments have from time to time in their dealings with China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion is very conscious of the matters raised by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who moved the motion, and I commend him for his lucid exposition of a lot of the more difficult political questions involved. He affirmed the most important element of this motion, the human rights aspect. The motion was carried unanimously in the Senate on 5 December. Regrettably, the procedures of this House will not lead to a vote for that to occur here, as much as I would like that and, I dare say, as much as my colleagues would like that. </PARA>
<PARA> The central issue raised in the motion concerns the abuse of human rights and the continuing abuse of human rights in Tibet. There is a wealth of evidence in relation to those continuing abuses and I will catalogue further those of which I am aware. I do want to reiterate, as the member who spoke before me did, the importance of 10 March, which will be the thirty-second anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirty-two years ago, the Tibetan people of Lhasa revolted against the oppression that they believed they were suffering from in their country, in their capital. The revolt was brutally suppressed. Sources indicate that something of the order of 87,000 Tibetans died in the months that followed. Many of the men of Tibet were taken away and sent to labour camps, and did not return. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we are discussing this motion at this time, because when the commemoration occurs again it will obviously be a difficult time for Tibetans, as there is the possibility of loss of life again. At the commemoration that was taking place three years ago on 10 March, martial law was imposed. So 10 March is a very important date. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to canvass the questions which gave rise to some important, although misinformed, editorial comment in the Australian Chinese Daily about the history of Tibet and its relations with China. It is obviously a matter of contest, although for my own part, I find very persuasive the material that the honourable member for Denison adduced in this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> But this motion is not about those issues of contest. There are continuing abuses of human rights occurring in Tibet. As the Secretary of the Parliamentary Amnesty Group, I rely very heavily upon what Amnesty International has to say. I do so because over a long period of involvement with Amnesty I have found Amnesty material to be prepared with the utmost thoroughness and I have found it to be an extraordinarily persuasive and accurate catalogue of what is occurring in the nations about which it comments. One finds in its summary reports-the reports themselves are detailed expositions-that in February 1989 Amnesty began to receive allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees in the Tibet Autonomous Region soon after the widespread arrests which followed the pro-independence demonstrations by Tibetan monks in the capital, Lhasa, in September and October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, particularly after 5 March 1988 when violent demonstrations occurred at the climax of the Mon Lam prayer festival in Lhasa, the organisation has received further detailed reports indicating persistent abuse of detainees. On several occasions since October 1987 Amnesty has appealed to the Chinese Government to investigate reports about human rights violations and it has continued to call for those investigations. In a follow-up report in March 1990 it recalled:</PARA>
<PARA>During the year since . . . March 1989 the imposition of martial law in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region . . . Tibetans have continued to be detained for peacefully exercising their right to hold and express opinions. </PARA>
<PARA>Many are held without charge or trial or have been sentenced after trials fell far short of international standards of fairness. Since March 1989 at least 53 people, some of them aged under 18, have been given administrative sentences of two to three years re-education through labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report of Amnesty for that year continues to detail a large number of people, many of whom died, many of whom were injured and many of whom were arrested. There are continuing reports right through that time. I come to the most recent report that I have before me, of 10 January this year. It details the death by torture of Lhakpa Tsering. According to detailed allegations received by Amnesty, this 20-year-old Tibetan political prisoner and possible prisoner of conscience reportedly died under torture on 15 December 1990 while held in the Drapchi prison in Lhasa. His body was reportedly handed over to his family on 16 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I could also go to the reports of other international agencies. The United States Committee for Refugees has released a brief, which I have before me, which indicates much the same thing. It states that during August and September 1990 more than 300 refugees made their way to Katmandu. Some of them remained in Nepal but others who had fled were not so lucky. Some were forcibly returned-43 refugees, including 27 monks and 6 nuns who had reportedly fled to Nepal, were returned. These problems continue to face Tibetan people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that context that we on this side of the House support the motion that is before us. Therefore, I want to comment briefly about developments since that time because I, personally, regret what the Government had to say in a statement about the situation in China. I will quote it but I will not comment on it. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>While freedom of speech and association continue to be severely repressed, with no sign of a return to the very open climate of political and economic discussion which preceded June 1989, in other respects there have been discernible improvements in the human rights situation in China. During the course of 1990 martial law was lifted in Beijing and Lhasa, and a large number of dissidents held following Tiananmen were released. More recently further dissidents have been released, and the trials of those remaining in incarceration have been conducted with many receiving sentences that-while in most cases still indefensible in civil rights terms-were more lenient than expected. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hill commented that he saw this as a turnaround in view on the Government's part. I think it is a matter of some note that we have a situation in which members of parliament believe, overwhelmingly, that human rights abuses are continuing. I certainly hope that that can be reflected in the statements that are being made by our Government about the views of the Australian people in relation to the situation in Tibet and in China generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second motion on Tibet that has been debated in this House on a Thursday morning during discussion of private members' business. In November 1988 a motion sponsored by the ex-member for McEwen, Mr Peter Cleeland and seconded by the then member for Higgins, Roger Shipton, was debated. I suppose that that illustrates the point that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) made: that this is an issue which has had a degree of bipartisan support. Peter Cleeland's motion centred on the role of the Dalai Lama in what has happened. On this occasion, the motion proposed by my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) directs itself particularly to human rights issues. In particular, it calls on the Government and the Peoples Republic of China to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . recognise the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Human Rights Covenants. </PARA>
<PARA>It might be appropriate to outline what some of those rights are. As honourable members may be aware, in 1948 Australia was one of the original members of the United Nations to vote for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since that commitment, Australia has become a party to several declarations and covenants which enhance that universal declaration. Amongst these covenants is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates that people have a right to privacy, their own language and religion; participation in public affairs; freedom of expression and opinion; freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of association and assembly; life, liberty and security of person; freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and a fair trial and equal treatment with others under the law. Another relevant covenant is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides for the full realisation of each person's right to adequate living conditions, work and fair wages, social security, freedom from hunger, health, education, trade union membership, cultural life and their natural wealth and resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, then, as we discuss this motion today is there so much talk about human rights violations? It is because of the number of independent organisations that have come out with reports which indicate that in Tibet there have been violations across the range of things which I have listed. A number of these reports have already been mentioned, but I will go through some of the more recent ones. In February 1989 the United Nations Commission for Human Rights issued a report which condemned the human rights record of the People's Republic of China in Tibet between October 1987 and March 1989. In a report published for the United Kingdom parliamentary human rights group in April 1989 it was alleged that over one million Tibetans had died between 1950 and 1984 as a direct result of Chinese rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, in January 1990 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights reiterated its concern at human rights abuses in Tibet. It noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Evidence of persistent human rights violations in Tibet since proindependence demonstrations started in September 1987 include numerous arbitrary arrests, long term detention without charge or trial, and torture. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1990 Amnesty International published its report on continuing repression in Tibet. In late May 1990 the AsiaPacific Forum on Tibet issued a report alleging that up to 2,000 people had been executed, and many more tortured in the six months prior to the lifting of martial law in Lhasa on 1 May 1990. In May 1990 Asia Watch made serious allegations regarding human rights, and again Amnesty International's annual report for 1990 noted the continuation of human rights abuses by the Chinese Government in Tibet throughout 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look carefully at this motion, we will see that it avoids making an opinion on one issue, and that issue is the independence of Tibet. But even if here in this motion we do not make comment on that, one of the important things that we must see as a basic human right of the people of Tibet is that they be allowed (a) to be involved in their own self-determination and (b) to be able to enter into peaceful protest about those issues. That is one of the important human rights that has been continuously violated in the period since the first occupations in 1950 through to this time. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 in this place the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia condemns abuses of human rights wherever and whenever they occur. While Australia acknowledges that Tibet is part of China, the Government and people of Australia remain deeply concerned that ethnic Tibetans should be treated according to internationally accepted standards of human rights. The concern of the Australian Government in all these respects has been registered with the Chinese Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another important point that must be made in this debate. When we generally talk about Tibet, it is not only the Tibetan autonomous region as designated by the People's Republic that we are talking about; it is the wider issue of those other provinces which Tibetan people have occupied over a great deal of time. Those issues, and the way in which the People's Republic of China has attempted to isolate the Tibetan people by making these artificial barriers, are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There have not only been the questions of population transfer which have been mentioned by other speakers; there are questions of displacement and questions of provision of inadequate housing which does not pay any regard to the traditional forms of housing which have evolved for the Tibetan people. </PARA>
<PARA> Also I would like to dwell on the way in which the natural environment has been abused in Tibet. Honourable members who have taken an interest in this issue will of course know of the Dalai Lama's five-point plan. The fourth point of that plan was:</PARA>
<PARA>Serious efforts must be made to restore the natural environment in Tibet. Tibet should not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and the dumping of nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA>Throughout history Tibetans have had a great respect for the environment. In an article in the Greenpeace magazine, Galen Rowell quotes a book by Heinrich Harrier Seven Years in Tibet where he talked about:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the frustration of working with Tibetans on the dike that to this day protects the capital city of Lhasa from flooding. ``There were many interruptions and pauses. There was an outcry if anyone discovered a worm on a spade. The earth was thrown aside and the creature put in a safe place''. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an indication of the Tibetan Buddhism belief which essentially prohibits the killing of animals. In this article in Greenpeace there is also a statement by the Dalai Lama on the environment. The Dalai says:</PARA>
<PARA>Peace and the survival of life on earth as we know it are threatened by human activities that lack a commitment to humanitarian values. Destruction of nature and natural resources results from ignorance, greed and lack of respect for the earth's living things. Our ancestors viewed the earth as rich and bountiful, which it is. Many people in the past also saw nature as inexhaustibly sustainable, which we know is the case only if we care for it. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members may not be aware that in the citation that went with the Dalai Lama's Nobel Peace Prize there was specific reference to the Dalai Lama's commitment to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> But still we see signs of the deforestation and plundering of resources in Tibet. It has been alleged, and was attested to by a tourist filming the way in which there were at least 60 fully laden timber trucks an hour leaving Tibet on two major roads to China, signalling the type of deforestation and environmental damage which again goes against UN resolutions which establish the rights of people to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to go to the last point in the motion which calls upon the Australian Government to continue its efforts in trying to bring to the forefront allegations of human rights abuses with the People's Republic of China. I mentioned the statements of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, in this House back in 1987. On various occasions over recent times the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has taken the opportunity to take up with Chinese officials the continuing human rights abuses. I think that is important, and I think that is the appropriate course of action. It is an important reflection of not only the views of both Houses of this Parliament, but the Australian people in general. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for bringing this matter before the House today. Of course, as the fourth speaker in a debate of this type there will be an inevitable amount of repetition. I make no apologies for that because I think it is a message that bears repeating frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, like statistics, history can sometimes be made to suit almost any point of view. If one takes a lengthy period of history, or just an appropriate snapshot to illustrate a particular claim, one can construct a case either for or against Tibet being part of China, almost as one wishes. How does one interpret, for example, the words `independence' and `autonomy' which have beset Tibet's history over the years? The duration of particular arrangements, the closeness of particular arrangements or the degree of control that has existed between China and Tibet over a long period of time-these are all variables which mean that in the end any answer is more to do with national interest and power rather than with justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore I do not intend today to pursue in detail the sorry history of Tibet. My concern is to address the major elements of this motion: the abuse of human rights in Tibet, the practices being perpetrated against Tibetans by the People's Republic of China, representations by the Australian Government and honourable members of this Parliament to the People's Republic of China on human rights abuses both generally and in Tibet in particular, and the call upon the Government of China to respond to these representations. I call on the Australian Government to continue to make representations to and seek responses from China on all of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much common ground between the Opposition and the Government in terms of our stance on Tibet and China. However, the coalition does not accept the view of discernible improvements, as my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) mentioned earlier, in terms of human rights in China. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a substantial body of evidence which clearly shows ongoing human rights abuses both in China and Tibet. We believe that China must demonstrate a preparedness to meet international standards on human rights before we normalise relationships between our two countries. However, I do not want to make this a narrow political debate because it is a bigger and broader issue. I want to focus on the common concern of all honourable members of this House which is human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many countries in the world where human rights abuses are taking place today. Whether it is East Timor, Lebanon, the West Bank or many other areas that I could list, that list is unfortunately all too long. We have all been conscious in recent weeks of the human rights abuses in Kuwait, where the world community was moved to take some action. We must be alert to each and every instance of human rights abuses. We may make progress in some situations but not in others, but we must always try. </PARA>
<PARA> Tibet is a relatively remote country and communication is often poor, but the treatment of human beings is nonetheless still a significant issue and of concern to us all. Let us look at the internal situation in Tibet. China practises a policy of segregation which frankly resembles apartheid. We see segregation of hospital wards, school restrictions and a host of other measures. Individuals are deprived of the basic freedoms of speech, movement and religious practice. In the 1980s China changed its policies towards minority nationalities-especially Tibetans-by banning assimilation practices. In 1987 demonstrations held by young monks in the wake of the execution of three Tibetans for alleged murder and robbery and a speech by the Dalai Lama calling for greater political autonomy resulted in October of that year in up to 20 people being killed in demonstrations, about 500 people being arrested, 12 foreign journalists being expelled from Tibet and tourists being barred from the region. In March 1989 the Chinese massacred at least 100 monks, nuns and civilians in Lhasa, and martial law, which was enforced throughout Tibet, remained in force until as recently as May 1990-not much more than six months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly read an extract from a United States committee for refugees issues brief from November of last year entitled `Tibetan Refugees Still at Risk':</PARA>
<PARA>Some observers argue that the Tibet of old has been much romanticized and that the lot of most Tibetan people has always been a harsh one. One thing is certain, though. As human rights groups have consistently documented, since the 1949-50 invasion and occupation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China, Tibet has been-and continues to be-a human rights nightmare . . . The massive outpouring of Tibetan refugees that took place in 1959, when an estimated 100,000 Tibetans followed their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, into exile, came in response to heightened repression by the Chinese authorities in Tibet following mass uprisings against Chinese rule. </PARA>
<PARA>Both this report and Amnesty International have extensively documented human rights abuses in Tibet by China. </PARA>
<PARA> In February this year 30 senators in the United States expressed concern to the Premier of China over the torture death of a Tibetan monk. They sent a letter to the Premier of China expressing their concern over the apparent torture and death of a 20-year old Tibetan political prisoner and the violent repression of Tibetans peacefully seeking to express their political views. </PARA>
<PARA> This young man was killed by Chinese prison authorities last December, apparently as a result of torture after he refused to comply with orders forbidding inmates from making political statements to Western journalists. His death was described by that group of American senators as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . yet another human rights tragedy in Tibet, all too typical of the cruel Chinese repression of the Tibetan people. </PARA>
<PARA>So we are not alone in taking this stand today. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Australia recognises that Tibet is part of China, we must still remain concerned to ensure that Tibetans can enjoy full human rights in their own land. As has already been said, next Monday, 10 March, is Tibet's national uprising day. This will be the thirty-second anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising day. Thirty-two years ago the Tibetan people of Lhasa revolted against the Chinese. They were brutally suppressed by the military authorities and Chinese sources indicate that 87,000 Tibetans died in the months that followed. Most of the men in Lhasa were taken away and sent to labour camps and many never returned. </PARA>
<PARA> The sobering thought for us is that last year on this day I understand that several hundred Tibetans were also killed. We must not forget Tibet. We must continue to demonstrate our concern and support at every opportunity. I strongly endorse the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate comes at a time of great change on the international scene when many of the traditionally accepted views of world order have been totally discarded. It is a period of great change and this motion before the House is a timely reminder that as a nation we must change our thinking on and our relations with South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that my abhorrence of and opposition to the system of apartheid is total. The practice of formalised racial discrimination as practised in South Africa throughout this century has been one of the most vile examples of human misery and degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> While in the past I have supported the general thrust of the Gleneagles Agreement of June 1977, I was always uncomfortable with the fact that the Commonwealth and other Western countries singled out South Africa for harsh economic, sporting and social sanctions. There is no doubt that South Africa has been consistently violating human rights, but so too have many other countries such as the Soviet Union, all the Eastern bloc countries-Romania in particular-China and many countries of South America, Asia and especially Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia and the Western world were always eager to single out South Africa for special treatment. Certainly South Africa deserved our condemnation, but it was not alone. The Gleneagles Agreement would have been of real and continuing value if it had been applied to all countries that were violating human rights. But this of course did not occur. The Commonwealth, including Australia, chose to be selective in its judgment of human suffering and oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> The last 18 months have seen the most radical changes one could imagine in the postwar era. The world has welcomed the end to the Cold War, the Berlin wall has come down and the reunification of Germany is a reality. President Gorbachev has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the world community has clearly demonstrated to Saddam Hussein that he cannot invade another country and get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, at the same time, South Africa has undergone massive changes within its political structure; the system of apartheid has been systematically dismantled and reform has occurred quickly. President F. W. de Klerk has been responsible for the implementation of significant reform, and yet his efforts have gone largely unrewarded. South Africa has shown quite clearly that it is seeking to rid itself of yesterday's mistakes and Australia must demonstrate that it is prepared to welcome the new South Africa back into the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of sporting sanctions against South Africa will be a significant starting point. It is vital that Australia reward the courage and vision of the men and women in South Africa who have taken their nation down the path of reform and towards a new era in their history. I was delighted when I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) state in early February that Australia would be proposing that the Commonwealth move immediately to phase out sanctions against South Africa and that sporting sanctions would be an obvious starting point. I was dismayed two weeks later to learn that the Australian Government was party to the communique of the Commonwealth foreign Ministers meeting in London- attended by Senator Evans-which failed to relax the sanctions in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement by the foreign Ministers said that all existing sanctions should be maintained until four major conditions relating to political prisoners, exiles, security legislation and key apartheid laws have been fully met. This statement commits Australia to a hard line on sanctions. So much for the Prime Minister's earlier assurances and so much for Australia offering President de Klerk the encouragement and the support he deserves in the process of dismantling apartheid. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Cobb" NAMEID="MF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr Cobb</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another broken promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IT4">Mr ATKINSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. Indeed, the statement from the Commonwealth foreign Ministers meeting provided President de Klerk with nothing to convince the hard right wing in South Africa that the dismantling of apartheid would bring any real benefits to the country. President de Klerk has gone out on a limb, and Australia has failed to extend the hand of friendship and encouragement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister told this House on 20 February 1991 that Australia should be pleased with its efforts at the Commonwealth meeting. That is not the case. Sporting sanctions are still in place and black and white South African sportsmen are denied the opportunity to compete in the international scene. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has the opportunity to have a real impact upon the progress of reform in South Africa. The Prime Minister recently told this House that the coalition parties had missed the train in the South African debate. The reality is that the Prime Minister has missed a once in a lifetime opportunity to assist President de Klerk with the awesome task of restructuring South Africa. On 22 October 1990 on the ABC radio program Grandstand the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>We've always wanted to not bring South Africa to its knees . . . but to bring it to the negotiating table. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Prime Minister: the table is set; lift the sporting sanctions and let the negotiations begin. </PARA>
<PARA> The changing political climate in South Africa is reason enough for the Australian Government to allow the restoration of normal sporting links with South Africa, but other factors also demand that Australia make immediate changes in its policy towards South Africa. The approach of Australia and the Commonwealth to the application of sports sanctions has been a dog's breakfast, to say the least. It has been riddled with inconsistencies and hypocrisy. We have targeted South Africa but have played sport with the Soviet Union, despite that country's atrocious breaches of human rights. There are no sporting sanctions against Indonesia. What do the Timorese think of that? We play sport against the People's Republic of China. Have we forgotten what occurred in Tiananmen Square? Did we have sporting sanctions against Romania or Iraq? The answer is no. Our morality has been selective and we have chosen an easy target. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of the inconsistencies. Under the terms of the Gleneagles Agreement an array of inconsistencies has evolved, and the agreement has become a farce. Under the terms of the Gleneagles Agreement, governments are supposed to discourage all sporting contact with South Africa, and the process is not intended to be selective. Indeed, the agreement makes no distinction between teams and individuals, between representatives of a country and non-representatives; nor are there conditions that some sports are banned while other are permitted. Yet a complete mishmash has developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Cricketers such as Alderman, Rackemann and Hughes have received condemnation for playing in South Africa, yet Greg Norman, Darren Gauci and Wayne Gardner have been excused for doing exactly the same thing. Pat Cash is condemned for playing tennis in South Africa, but we forget that Evonne Goolagong did likewise. We place enormous pressure upon our champion sports men and women to stay out of South Africa, and yet we hail Johan Kriek when he wins the Australian Open on two occasions. The national Australian gymkhana team can visit South Africa but the national rugby team cannot. The inconsistencies are never ending, and it is time the farce stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is important that we consider the harm being done to black African sportsmen in South Africa. While the world sits back and points the finger at South Africa, many black South Africans are being denied the opportunity to compete at an international level. If given the opportunity, South Africa would be one of the great sporting nations of the world, and many, if not most, of its champions would be black. The world is being denied the opportunity of seeing outstanding black South African soccer players, rugby players, cricketers, marathon runners-the list is endless. Black South Africans are being denied the right to compete at the highest level and to be rewarded accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> At the recent Commonwealth Ministers meetings it was accepted that sporting contact should be resumed in those sports that had achieved non-racial unity. This decision is years overdue as the offensive legislation restricting integrated sport has been removed from South African statute books since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The Gleneagles Agreement belongs to another time and to very different circumstances. Times have changed, and it is important for the Australian Government to show that it can move with the times. President de Klerk has shown that he has the vision to bring about radical reform within that country. We as a nation must not hinder his efforts but, rather, give him every encouragement. The restoration of normal sporting links with the Republic of South Africa is a practical and tangible beginning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion was first moved by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in October of last year. Since then we have seen significant progress on this issue. Indeed, as the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) mentioned, it is a time of change, and there has been significant change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important for us to consider why this change has been occurring in South Africa. The very impetus for the change, the very force behind the change, has been the sanctions that have prevailed in that country. The sporting boycott has over a long period hurt white South Africans and caused them to recognise the need for change in their country. The honourable member for Isaacs said, erroneously I might say, that apartheid has been dismantled. That is not the case. Apartheid is being dismantled. There is a significant difference there. </PARA>
<PARA> As a logical and sensible response to that approach, the position of our Government and the position of the majority of the Commonwealth is that there should be a phased removal of sanctions over time. In reward for the changes that are occurring in South Africa, it is appropriate that those sports in which there is unified administration have the possibility of competing internationally over time. </PARA>
<PARA> I was outspoken in respect of sporting boycotts in 1980, when the Opposition at the time proposed that there be a boycott of the Olympic Games in Moscow. I opposed it then because I did not believe that there would a unified approach. Indeed, there was not a unified approach, and the position in respect of that boycott was farcical. Over a long period it has been my belief that the regime in South Africa is abhorrent, and it is a small measure of our ability to protest that we have been able to unify the sporting world in its abhorrence of that regime. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to remember that the catalyst for the Gleneagles Agreement was the refusal of South Africa to allow Basil D'Oliveira, a member of the English cricket team, to tour that country. I am not aware of any other nations-and a number were mentioned by the honourable member-that have taken the view that teams from other countries have to adjust their selection policy in order to be allowed to compete against them. In respect of sport, that was a situation that could not be condoned, and very few people would be able to defend it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read through the speech the honourable member for Parkes made in October. Essentially, we have had a rehash of that today from the honourable member for Isaacs. Let us take some of the issues that were raised in that speech. The honourable member for Parkes said at the time that there was probably less racial discrimination in sport in South Africa than in Australian sport. The justification for that was that there are blacks on selection panels and that blacks dominate many of the teams. That is not surprising in South Africa; 77 per cent of the population is black. In Australia 2 per cent of the population is black. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that there should be some dominance of selection panels or participation in national sporting teams is absurd; the justification does not exist. I find it very difficult to accept that in this country the majority of the population who watch sport and are keenly interested in it would accept that there is more discrimination here than in South Africa. It is an absurd proposition and the honourable member should not have put it. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion was also made that the vast majority of blacks themselves do not want boycotts any more than they want sanctions. It is a difficult proposition to ascertain, but it is clear that there is support for sanctions by the leaders of the black majority in South Africa, and they have made it clear on any number of occasions. Nelson Mandela, in his visit to this country last year, made it very clear that there was support amongst the black majority in South Africa for sanctions. They know it hurts their country, but their overwhelming aim is to bring about political change in South Africa. They believe that sanctions have been a prime mover in bringing about those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested that the Prime Minister has made many back-flips and is being hypocritical in respect of South Africa. He made the point in Question Time here, and I think it has been clear, that from the time that he was leading the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the early 1970s until now his position on this issue has been very consistent. Indeed, he made the point that the train is nearing the station of a free, democratic, non-racial South Africa and that the Opposition has never been on it. He makes a valid point, because at every turn the Opposition has taken a position which, if it does not say so specifically, implies support for the regime in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Further justification put forward by the honourable member for Parkes for his view is that Government policy is not supported by the vast majority of Australians. My view would be that the vast majority of Australians probably do not care enough about this issue and probably have not taken enough interest in it, but it was clear at the time when there were significant protests in this country that Australians who were informed about the issue felt very strongly about the regime in South Africa and the need for change. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the significant change in Australia's attitude-and by the middle of this year there is likely to be a loosening of our approach to sporting contacts with South Africa-is the change that has occurred in South Africa. President de Klerk, in his statement of 1 February, endorsed the concept of a multi-party conference to advance constitutional negotiations and announced the Government's intention to introduce legislation to repeal the lands Act, the groups areas Act, the development of black communities Acts and the population registration Acts of 1950. Those are the pillars of the apartheid regime, so it is appropriate that there be a response to this declaration by President de Klerk and that there be a response to the changes that are occurring in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken with the leaders of sporting organisations in South Africa, in particular Dr Ali Bacher, who is in control of cricket in that country, and they have made enormous progress in the past few years. By the end of this year, if the program that has been laid out by President de Klerk is adhered to, we will be in a position where I am sure tours of this country by South African cricketers, or vice versa, will be possible, will be condoned by the black majority in that country and will be supported by the governments in this country and South Africa. A significant shift is occurring and it is occurring in a way which is phased and appropriate, considering the changes that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point that I wish to pursue is one also raised by the honourable member for Isaacs and by the honourable member for Parkes in his speech in October when he suggested that there was enormous inconsistency. I do not think that in any area of foreign policy we could ever say we were perfect, but it is essentially the same argument as that in respect of whether we should be involved in the recent war in Iraq. Many put the argument: we took a different position on East Timor; why should we take this position in respect of Iraq?</PARA>
<PARA> People may be able to build a case for breaking off sporting contacts and implementing a wider number of sanctions against countries who we believe are infringing human rights, but in no case have we seen an example such as the one we saw in the 1960s where South Africans took the view that a visiting sporting team to their country could not be selected in the way in which the visiting team chose. That was the position that South Africa took in respect of D'Oliveira. No other country, to my knowledge, has ever taken that position in respect of a sporting team from this country or other Commonwealth countries. It was landmark stuff and unfortunately, because of it, South Africa copped the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The point also needs to be made that if a national sporting team from this country visits South Africa, the propaganda possibilities are enormous. The acceptance and agreement of conduct in that sport that is implied by that visit is significant. Yet, if individuals make the choice to visit, in a free country such as Australia it is appropriate that they should be able to do so, whatever their motivation may be-and in most cases the motivation has been simply financial. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a black and white issue, if honourable members will excuse my use of those terms. I do not think that members on this or any side of the House could say that we have been perfect in our application and our consistency. But some cases are worse than others, and in respect of apartheid in South Africa our response has been appropriate. The response that has occurred in that country as a result of our action has been significant; indeed, it is fair to say that there is a correlation between the sanctions and the response that we have had. The Government's position is that sporting contacts will resume, but they will resume in a phased and sensible way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the course of this debate we have listened to a series of arguments defining why there has been in place since 1977 a system of sporting sanctions against South Africa, giving examples of enforcing and evading those sanctions and justifying and explaining this Government's current position in relation to those sporting sanctions. But in reality all these arguments have really been about mythology and hypocrisy. I use those descriptions with great care because whenever we are discussing any aspect of apartheid the word itself is such an emotive word that it immediately evokes conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that this argument is shrouded in mythology because as soon as we use the term `sporting sanctions' in relation to South Africa, we immediately think of the term `Gleneagles Agreement'. It must be stressed that the Gleneagles Agreement has assumed a mantle of authority rivalling that of the Ten Commandments. It has been, and still is, regarded as the `thou shall and thou shall not' document regarding sporting contact with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I maintain that a mythology has developed from a misunderstanding of what the Gleneagles Agreement really is. It should be re-emphasised that the Gleneagles Agreement was originally known as the Commonwealth statement on apartheid in sport, and that is precisely what it was-a statement drawn up and agreed to by Commonwealth heads of government in June 1977. That statement was never formally ratified, it was never actually signed, and sporting bodies affected by the Agreement were never consulted. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two key areas of that Agreement that have been responsible for the misunderstanding that has developed into a mythology. There appears to have developed over the years the myth that it is legitimate for individual South African sporting identities to compete in Australia, but that it is wrong for its sporting teams to visit and compete. Equally, a blind eye has been turned to numerous Australian individuals going to South Africa, when it was taboo for our sporting teams to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of misunderstanding is that it is individuals who are in breach of the agreement and should be sanctioned. Remember, as the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) said a moment ago, when Kim Hughes was branded a rebel for visiting South Africa. However, according to the Gleneagles Agreement, this is not so. If, as this Government claims, it supports the Gleneagles Agreement, then it must adhere to what is stated in that agreement, and that is that there should be no sporting contact whatsoever-no individual or team contact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. If there is and the Government has not attempted to discourage it, then it is the Government that is in breach of the agreement and not the sportspeople involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The banning of all sporting contact as described in the Gleneagles Agreement has been broken on numerous occasions, as has been described previously. The long list of individuals who have competed demonstrates the hypocrisy of the stance taken by governments and of the agreement itself. Perhaps the greatest hypocrisy is the position taken by this Government and others in assuming that they know what is best for both the white and non-white sportspeople of South Africa. Apartheid has been an unjust system of government, rightly criticised by all nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I first became aware of the term `apartheid' at the age of 13 when I read Alan Paton's novel Cry the Beloved Country. I can still vividly recall the feelings of revulsion and horror when I read that novel. At that innocent age of 13, I could not comprehend how racial differences could produce such deep-seated hatred, hostility, anger and fear. I soon learnt, however, that these were the hallmarks of a system of separate economic, political and social development on grounds of racial differences that perpetuated the system that became known as apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same age of 13, I was a young sportswoman representing my State in my chosen sport of swimming. Like every young athlete, I had my heroes to look up to. They provided me with the inspiration to train harder, to do better and to compete at the international level. Can honourable members imagine what it must have been like in South Africa during the past 30 years to know that you have a sporting talent but are denied the opportunity to develop that talent by competing in the international arena? That denial of opportunity has produced a lack of contact, especially between young people from various countries, with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Gleneagles Agreement itself, which states that member countries are conscious that sport is an important means of developing and fostering understanding between people, especially between the young people of all countries. The agreement also states that member countries are also aware that, quite apart from other factors, sporting contacts between their nationals and the nationals of countries practising apartheid in sport tend to encourage the belief, however unwarranted, that countries are prepared to condone this abhorrent policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of providing a forum to expose apartheid, what the Gleneagles Agreement has actually achieved is a denial of a forum where young people can meet, share experiences and explain what it is really like. It has denied countries like Australia the opportunity of using the international forum as a means of telling the world from first-hand experience exactly the conditions that exist for sportspeople. That has been a golden opportunity lost, because international sportspeople could have used that opportunity constantly in the international forum to bring pressure to bear on the South African Government. What the Gleneagles Agreement has done is actually help perpetuate all the negative aspects of sport among the different races in South Africa. It missed a golden opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other level of hypocrisy about this debate in regard to Australia's position is that we have often witnessed the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) using sportspeople to promote a cause. Why then did he not use our own sporting elite to highlight the inequities within the South African sporting system? Again, the mythology that has surrounded the Gleneagles Agreement has in itself prevented this sort of contact and has increased the hypocrisy of nations. </PARA>
<PARA> By being a citizen of a country which maintained international sporting relations, I was privileged to be able to advance in my sport and to pass on to others the knowledge and experience that I had gained. I still have a drawer full of medals and trophies, but they are not the lasting legacies of my sporting career. The real benefit has been the contacts and the friends that I have made throughout this country and in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The main effect of these sporting boycotts within South Africa has been to further subjugate the different races and to create in them a feeling of absolute powerlessness to bring about any change in their own situation. The Gleneagles Agreement, and this country as a supporter of that agreement, has made an assumption that by denying access to sporting competitions between individuals from our two countries that was going to highlight the inequities of the system of apartheid and bring about changes. I do not believe that this is so. In fact, I think it has helped, as I have just stated, to reinforce that system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another level of the hypocrisy surrounding this debate is the current position taken by this Government. When the news was broken that President de Klerk had taken the brave step to begin the dismantling process of apartheid, the Prime Minister proclaimed that sporting sanctions would be among the first to be relaxed. He then changed his position last October during the visit of Nelson Mandela and appeared to be towing the line put by the African National Congress. At the February meeting in London of the Commonwealth foreign Ministers, the Government's earlier stated position that it would encourage the early removal of these sporting sanctions was not the view decided upon by those Commonwealth foreign Ministers. Instead, it was decided that sporting sanctions would not even be considered until September of this year. So much for the leadership steps taken by this Government!</PARA>
<PARA> There is undoubtedly a level of hypocrisy between the Government's earlier stated position on its relaxation of sporting sanctions and the position that it is actually now taking with other countries. I support this motion put before this House by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) that the Australian Government allow the restoration of normal sporting links with South Africa and, in so doing, put an end once and for all to the mythology and hypocrisy surrounding this whole issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in opposition to this motion but also to question some of the issues raised by the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey). Her very first statement, in which she talks about a denial of opportunity in sport for those people in South Africa through the sporting boycotts, goes indeed to the very heart of the question of why sporting boycotts have been in place and sanctions apply generally. I have only to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who said when greeting Nelson Mandela in Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The inequity of a system which determines political, social and human rights according to the colour of a person's skin is deeply offensive in a country like ours. We are not perfect, but the concept of a fair go for all is an Australian ideal. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely, this is where we must come to when we look at sporting sanctions for South Africa. While the honourable member may weep for those denied the opportunity of sport in the international arena, we should also concern ourselves with the very basic issue where people are denied the right to eat, vote, work, live with their family and move about in their own country where they are the majority. Surely, we cannot divorce the sporting sanctions from the actual horror of apartheid which is institutionalised and entrenched within the system in South Africa. However, as the world has changed in eastern Europe, we have also been pleased to see some movement in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as Reverend Frank Chikane, who succeeded Archbishop Tutu as the General Secretary of the South African churches in 1987, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions prevent white South Africa turning back the reform process. It is the pressure of sanctions and the isolation that has put South Africa where it is now. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no denying that it is the pressure of sanctions that has brought about those changes, which will see the lifting of some of the sporting boycotts before this year is out. After all, sanctions are a diplomatic tool. They are a spur to the negotiating process; not an alternative to it. The ultimate goal of sanctions is political-to promote negotiation. The immediate goal is to create a growing group of people who will press for genuine talks and thus help build a lobby for negotiations. Sporting sanctions, the isolation within South Africa, and the needs, demands and aspirations of South Africans have been addressed through de Klerk's changes for reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been heard about government policy, the Government's position and the issues it has faced. Never at any stage has the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) changed his view on South Africa. He has been consistent from the early 1970s, when as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he abhorred apartheid and the situation it created. He has continued to support the imposition of sanctions, despite the fact that we as Australians and we as its government embrace sporting contacts and see sport as a means of competing in the international arena, and indeed have an enthusiasm for sporting contacts. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the rationale for the policy of isolating South Africa was that the sports-mad white population had to be made to understand that there were costs to its own lifestyle from imposing apartheid laws on the rest of the South African community. The nub of the problem was the continuance of apartheid laws as the legal pillar supporting white domination. It is not the international community that has imposed sanctions but the actions of the South African Government, which has maintained apartheid and in turn has maintained sporting boycotts. </PARA>
<PARA> In February we had a Commonwealth Ministers conference on South Africa. It locked the Commonwealth into a phased program of relaxing sanctions as the reform promises of the South African Government are met by results on the ground. Agreement was also reached that the issue of sporting contacts would be delinked from the general sanctions policy and would be determined by developments within sporting organisations in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairly and squarely, Commonwealth Ministers have said to South Africans, and in particular white South Africans, that the issue of sporting boycotts-and playing in the international sporting arena-is in their own hands. The Commonwealth has now agreed that there should be no barriers placed on the resumption of international sporting contacts in respect of those sports which have achieved unified, non-racial administration and which have been recognised in that respect by the relevant representative non-racial sporting organisations. Australia's objectives were met in these important respects. The program of action outlined here meets with the united, credible and effective role which Australia is playing, along with other Commonwealth countries, in moving towards the lifting of those sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that by the end of April, due to President de Klerk's courageous stance, the person to person sanctions will be removed so that some of those pillars of apartheid will be shifted. However, as we move towards the commencement of the reform process we cannot impede that process because it is clearly a situation in which the sporting sanctions are reinforcing reform within South Africa. We hope that the agreement that sport is achieving unity is recognised by the international community and will enable South Africa to move into the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have said that they expect to see soccer within the international arena very soon. In this respect there is firstly the Steering Committee on South African Sports, which consists of representatives from the National Olympic and Sports Congress, including Mr George, who was in Australia earlier this year; the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee, including Mr Ramsamy; and the South African Council of Sport. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in view of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the concentration of ownership of the press which is unprecedented in Australia's history and unparalleled in any Western democracy; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the unacceptable concentration of power, the restrictions on the diversity of information and ideas, the barriers to entry and other aspects of market failure, the diminished localism of content and accountability, the debilitating impact on journalistic culture and the conflicts of interest which this concentration of ownership involves</PARA>
<PARA>this House calls for the establishment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the press including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the extent of concentration in the ownership and control and the effects of that on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the provision of accurate, fair and comprehensive news;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the diversity of opinions and the opportunities for expression; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the practice of journalism; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the regulatory framework in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The current level of concentration of ownership of the press is unprecedented in Australia's history and unparalleled in any liberal democracy. News Ltd owns seven of the 14 capital city and national daily newspapers. Those newspapers had 61.8 per cent of the audited average daily circulation on 30 September last year. In addition, the Adelaide News and the Brisbane Sun have 8.2 per cent of metropolitan daily circulation and they are printed, distributed and in effect underwritten by News Ltd, and they are both controlled by former News Ltd executives. Therefore, News Ltd either owns or effectively controls 70 per cent of the daily metropolitan newspaper circulation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fairfax Group, which is in receivership, owns three titles, with 19.1 per cent of metropolitan circulation; the Bell group owns one title, with 8.5 per cent of the circulation; and Kerry Stokes owns the Canberra Times, which has 1.6 per cent of total metropolitan circulation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, News Ltd owns or controls nine of the 12 Sunday newspapers, five of the regional dailies and 66 of the suburban newspapers, with 51 per cent of total circulation. It also owns 45 per cent of Australian Associated Press, the only domestic wire service; half of the only domestic producer of newsprint; and several major printeries. It is therefore quite clear that News Ltd has such a dominant position in newspaper publishing that it is no longer accurate to describe the industry as competitive; rather, it is an oligopoly with one dominant firm. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further facts are relevant when considering News Ltd's hegemony. First, since 1985 Rupert Murdoch, News Ltd's chief executive, has been a citizen of the United States of America. Second, though editors sometimes say he gives them no orders, ex-editors tell a different story and so does he: Murdoch has never pretended to be the kind of proprietor who appoints editors and leaves them to make decisions. When a Murdoch editor gets no orders it is because he knows the boss's mind well enough not to need them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other centrally significant fact about the press at present is that the Fairfax group is in receivership. This means that the future ownership of the group is quite uncertain. While it is unlikely that the Government would allow News Ltd to acquire the Fairfax group, it is certainly possible that Australian Consolidated Press, largely owned and controlled by Kerry Packer, could try to so order its affairs that it would be possible for it to purchase the Fairfax group. This would risk breaking the spirit, if not the letter, of the cross-media ownership rules which set a strict limit on the extent to which a company involved in one arm of the media can own companies in another. It is also possible that foreign companies might bid for Fairfax, raising the question of the extent to which foreign investment should be allowed in the Australian press. </PARA>
<PARA> This degree of concentration of press ownership threatens freedom of expression. Concentrated newspaper ownership is irreconcilable with a democratic society. A viable marketplace of ideas depends to some extent upon a competitive industry structure. Many people used to argue that freedom is indivisible. Whilst this is an oversimplification, it clearly contains an important truth. A high degree of concentration of control over the flow of information is quite unacceptable in a democracy, whether or not that power is used. </PARA>
<PARA> Rupert Murdoch himself said in the 1970s that it was wrong for one person to dominate the press marketplace. He was quoted in November 1977 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be a pity if I grew any bigger in Australia. There are now basically three groups in Australia, and that's too few already. If I were to grow bigger and take over one of the other groups-or be taken over-that would be against the public interest. I would like there to be six groups-</PARA>
<PARA>Rupert Murdoch said-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the fewer there are, the worse it is. </PARA>
<PARA>The widely respected British economic weekly The Economist argued editorially not long ago that no one press proprietor in Britain should control more than 25 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. In the early 1980s, the Canadian Government proposed setting a maximum upper limit on Canadian daily newspaper circulation from one group of 20 per cent, though it did not in the end legislate for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The central point is that a high concentration of power is fundamentally undemocratic. Power gives its holders greater economic and political influence than those without it. It would be very difficult for a Cabinet Minister to treat an aged pensioner with as much care and attention as is afforded to Rupert Murdoch. Power often corrupts and, though this is not inevitable, the powerful generally act in their own self-interest and find ideologies which justify the way they act. That is one reason why we should examine sceptically what they tell us is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> There are of course other seriously damaging consequences of a high concentration of press ownership. The reduction in the number of channels for the expression of opinion, particularly in ways that are readily accessible to the whole community, may well deprive large parts of the population of information and ideas. The existence of a dominant media group increases barriers to entry for other potential proprietors who might dilute the concentration by opening new newspapers. Also, large media conglomerates tend to publish less local material because of the advantage they have in economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA> A particularly serious consequence is that the existence of one strongly dominant group tends to undermine the capacity for independent journalism. A highly concentrated media has a debilitating impact on journalistic culture because of the tendency it creates for self-censorship. The lack of alternative employment forces journalists to be more attentive to the ideas and interests of a dominant proprietor, leading to the tendency to exclude other ideas or information. Of course there can be conflicts of interest. The most widely acknowledged example in Australia is that caused by the link between News Ltd and Ansett Australia, which tends to lead to uncritical and blandly unanalytical comment in the Murdoch press on the activities of our major private domestic airline. A clear indication of the damage which concentration can cause is the lack of discussion of this issue in News Ltd newspapers. It will be interesting to see what coverage they give to this parliamentary debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current situation, journalists are not encouraged to scrutinise their own industry's politics, economics or ethics with the alacrity they are urged to use in scrutinising others. Editorialists, who are usually so quick and certain in their judgments about most other people, are generally restrained and coy about their own industry. However, the Fairfax Group's coverage of its own affairs in recent years has been a striking exception to this general point. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of good information about the media is only one justification for a royal commission. A public inquiry, backed by research resources and the power to obtain evidence, would take the matter out of the hands of the proprietors, who have the most to fear from analysis of their comfortable position. Owners would be participants in a debate, not controllers of it, and the agenda would be set by outsiders. A rather cloistered media industry would benefit from a public grilling about consumption, decision making processes, self-regulation and, on the face of it, anti-competitive economics. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia only the Hamer Liberal Government in Victoria has been willing to establish a public inquiry into the press, although the Victorian Labor Government has recently published a report by a working party on print media ownership. Similarly useful contributions have been made by British royal commissions in 1949, 1962 and 1977, and by the 1981 Canadian royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has an overwhelming need for a national public inquiry into the press with terms of reference tailored for the task. Its recommendations for reform are likely to be difficult to implement, but the very existence of a royal commission would influence public opinion in ways which are likely to make the commission's recommendations more widely understood and acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is strong support for a royal commission into the press from the Australian Journalists Association (AJA), the organisation most directly and professionally concerned with this issue. An AJA-sponsored rally at the Sydney Opera House last November was attended by between 1,200 and 2,000 people. That meeting endorsed the idea of an inquiry into newspaper monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the extent of press concentration, as well as the fragile state of the Fairfax press, a royal commission would be timely. Establishment of a royal commission would involve political courage but it would be one of the most important actions government could take to strengthen democracy in Australia. Without a change in the pattern of press ownership, freedom of expression in Australia will be severely constrained. A royal commission would generate not only information but also recommendations about the most appropriate means for achieving greater diversity. Diversity of ownership of the press is a necessary requirement for a mature democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always fascinated when members of the Left-two of whom are present-speak on these matters. One thing about members of the Left in the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is that they have some principles. They will stand up and say what they believe in. It is not like members of the right wing, who will sell out anything at all in the Labor Party. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) represent their beliefs and I am glad to see them do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only yesterday or the day before it was reported on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said, `We can't have an inquiry into the press; we might upset Rupert'. Goodness gracious me! I had not intended to speak in this debate, but it is worth while discussing what has really been going on in some of the background issues around the press gallery and so forth. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have taken an extraordinary interest in the affairs of the Fairfax Group. Any journalist will tell us that; they are always up there asking what the latest gossip is in relation to the affairs of Fairfax. Why? Because the New South Wales Right has been offended by the Fairfax newspapers and it would like to see their demise. </PARA>
<PARA> What else has been going on? The 1986 amendments to the communications Act resulted in the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) being rolled and the views of the Treasurer prevailing. What was the result of that? The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd was bought out by Murdoch and the Managing Director of the Herald and Weekly Times was informed before Murdoch got there that the Government was on side with the bid. We would have to wonder what the background to that was. We have only to look at some of the quotes of the Treasurer to find out. He wanted to get rid of one of those dreadful Liberal Party-backing outlets in the media. </PARA>
<PARA> Quentin Dempster is now the ABC presenter on the 7.30 Report in New South Wales, but before that he was instrumental in Queensland in bringing out some truth as to what was going on in that State. In his speech at the rally that was mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>What we really got out of Keating's cross-media rule-separate owners for print, television and radio-was more highly concentrated ownership particularly with print following the Murdoch takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times. </PARA>
<PARA>The Herald and Weekly Times takeover enabled a tremendous concentration in Australia on the print media. As the previous speaker said, something like 70 per cent is now held by this one group. That clearly adds up to the concern that the Treasurer expressed to one of the party committee meetings of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> When we on this side of the House were in government, we were similarly guilty of bending the knee. I refer here to the 1981 amendment, known as the Murdoch amendment, in which we bent the knee to allow an Australian who was about to become an expatriate to continue his holding here. The agreement was made with Cabinet; I was a member of the Government at the time and I am aware of what happened. A year later, he upped and became an American citizen anyway, so we were left to wonder what had gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> In this area we have an enormous push for power. There is a power connection between the concentration of media ownership and the exercise of government, and the manipulation that goes on in this area is enormous. We can go beyond Australia and look at what has happened to the various newspaper empires in Great Britain, through the Beaverbrook influence. Beaverbrook was a member of the War Cabinet during the Second World War. His papers were definitely used for propaganda reasons; there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at America, we have the direct word of the former mayor of New York who said that he could not have got his nomination back except for the intervention of the New York Times or the New York afternoon paper that is owned by Murdoch. On top of that, there were connections throughout the Carter regime and on to the Reagan years. Newspaper proprietors who exercise this sort of power rapidly go beyond the law. As a consequence of that, they do not really have any regard for governments, particularly for politicians; they have regard only for their own survival. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up everyone else's speaking time, so in the remaining five minutes that I have, I will refer briefly to a television program which I saw at Christmas time produced, I think, by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The program pointed to some rather odd business dealings within News Limited. One was clearly a case of insider trading and the other was to do with probable breaches of the Trade Practices Act. No action has been taken. The shares of News Limited went down. The issue was largely pitched to the question of whether the group could be re-financed. </PARA>
<PARA> Could anybody genuinely say that a person who exercises influence in Britain and America and who controls 70 per cent of the print media in Australia is not going to get refinanced? That is just not credible. As a consequence of that, I wonder what was behind the lowering of those shares at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other influence which I think is worth while discussing. There was an attempt in two capital cities to use the classified ads of governments to push around the newspapers. This happened in Queensland, where we had the Bjelke-Petersen Government taking government ads out of the Courier-Mail and putting them into another newspaper-the Murdoch paper, Daily Sun. That paper did not have the circulation, the influence or certainly the buying market that the Courier-Mail had. Those accounts were subsequently switched back to the Courier-Mail, one year later, possibly two years later. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to Quentin Dempster's speech, in which he looked to the press to inform the people. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The people of Victoria are now entitled to demand of their media why they were not earlier informed of their cumulative indebtedness through that State's financial quangos, the VEDC and Trico-that fast track for fast bucks for entrepreneurial spivs. Now there's to be an expensive royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Western Australia are entitled to ask of their media why they were not informed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland, of course, there's been an ongoing debate about the historic uselessness of the Courier-Mail newspaper-until a short period in 1987-</PARA>
<PARA>that is when the particular matter I was referring to took place-</PARA>
<PARA>to inform Queenslanders about what was really going on in their State over seven decades of bipartisan rorting. </PARA>
<PARA>Dempster there is referring to the things which are alluded to in the use of those particular powers of government and the management of certain areas. What should be done about these matters? I am not sure about royal commissions. Royal commissions are normally set up when we know the answer. If we do not know the answer we do not set up the royal commission; once again, ask Bjelke-Petersen. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore suggest that it would be better if we looked at the Trade Practices Act in Australia and made sure that section 50 has the power to enforce competition and divestment and, if necessary, to consider anti-trust laws in this nation, because the concentration of economic power is too great in many areas. To say simply that with market forces anybody can start up a newspaper is nonsense. Anyone attempting to start up a suburban newspaper would be forced out in the crunch between the Murdoch press on the one side and Fairfax on the other-to wit, there was a small attempt at this in the suburb of Wynnum, which the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), who is sitting at the table, represents. An entrepreneurial newspaper there was forced out under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not seen in Australia a new national paper except for Murdoch's Australian-and it has kept going only because of the cross-subsidisation with the News Corporation. Within Queensland, the circulation on a weekly basis is something of the order of 25,000 copies, which is hardly enough to sustain its circulation on a weekly basis. In terms of other areas, if one were to set up another significant circulation in a capital city, how would one get it around? After all, we have sanctioned the newsagents' deal under the Trade Practices Act; as they are run by the current distribution outlets, we could have a tied position there. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than have a royal commission-which, as I say, I am dubious about-I would have a lengthy look at the Trade Practices Commission. In the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of May 1989 there was a suggestion that a broader inquiry be held into how the Trade Practices Commission could be used in a broader way. That report, I understand, went to the Government-the Attorney-General at the time was Lionel Bowen-and nothing has come out of it because it is too hard. Big friends would be offended. That is a pity. Politicians demean themselves; parliaments demean themselves; and governments demean themselves if they are bluffed by the proprietors of major newspapers in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first thank the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) for his support for this proposition. One can find oneself supporting a great deal of what he had to say. More importantly, I commend my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for initiating this discussion. Like him and others, I note the lack of a packed press gallery on this very important issue. Members of the press are there when there is blood on the floor, but when there is some examination of their industry, and even their future, they seem to be too busy in their little offices, probably watching the square box.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan mentioned the recent reports in the Sydney Morning Herald dealing with statements by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I had intended to touch on just one aspect of them. It is obvious that we are going to have a battle on this side of the House to get any movement. If this is the Treasurer's view let us hope that he does not succeed. But he is reported to have said that the extent of the control by Murdoch is unclear; he believes the figure closer to 56 per cent than 70 per cent. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>To ascertain the correct figure Mr Keating has agreed to get his Treasury Department to do a study on Mr Murdoch's ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>I think just that alone would be sufficient to ring the alarm bells that even the Treasurer of this country, the Deputy Leader of the Government, does not know the controlling interests that Murdoch has in the print media in Australia. The audited average circulation puts that figure-and it is a public figure-at 61.8 per cent, and it was referred to by my colleague the honourable member for Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> At a local level, the Australian Press Council's annual report No. 13 dated 30 June 1989, which is the latest one I have been able to obtain, provides some dark and frightening figures for the people of my own State, South Australia, as to the control of the `Dirty Digger', as he is known in the United Kingdom, Murdoch. </PARA>
<PARA> In information supplied by the Advertiser Newspapers Ltd on the Adelaide holdings, we see that the Murdoch ownership percentage for the Adelaide Advertiser is 100 per cent; that for the weekend newspaper, the Adelaide Sunday Mail, 50 per cent, with the other 50 per cent being controlled by the Adelaide News. There are very serious doubts as to who owns the Adelaide News. It is London to a brick on that the Murdoch empire would have a control there. Of the suburban newspapers in Adelaide, 12 mastheads are controlled and owned by Murdoch. Of the monthly publications, Family Circle is 100 per cent owned by Murdoch; the figure for Better Homes and Gardens is 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Other media interests include AAP Information Services Pty Ltd, Australian Newsprint Mills Holdings Ltd and Television Broadcasting Investments Pty Ltd, the ownership percentage of the latter being 40.6 per cent. The tentacles and control of the print media and the media generally in South Australia is something of deep and constant concern to its citizens. The concern for an inquiry, whether it be a royal commission or some other type of inquiry, goes back some number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> In Adelaide in 1987 a national non-partisan coalition of community and consumer groups, media unions, journalists and others from many walks of life joined together in what was called the Free the Media Coalition. The following organisations were part of that coalition: the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Journalists Association, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, Actors Equity, the Producers and Directors Guild, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and many others. What this coalition had to say in 1987, particularly on the Murdoch takeover, is still very relevant. I would like to deal with just some of the statements that were made by that organisation in publications. One such statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The words that follow have been chosen with care. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is true. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Australians face an unprecedented national crisis over the control of their newspapers and television. </PARA>
<PARA> At stake is the democratic future of our society. Should a handful of wealthy business people be allowed a stranglehold on the information and opinion they supply to the people? Should they wield such power and influence, make deals with politicians, shape this country? Should a foreign citizen enjoy great power? No comparable nation tolerates what may now be thrust upon Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Community resistance is shaping on a wide front. It embraces shades of politics from right to left and a diversity of public interest, union, media, church, migrant and other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Newspapers are the immediate issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Rupert Murdoch has been fighting to take over the big Herald and Weekly Times empire and may well have succeeded. The win will give him an iron grip on Australia's press. </PARA>
<PARA> Three major groups will have become two. A giant Murdoch could have ten of the nineteen capital city dailies, Fairfax five, and Holmes a Court two. Murdoch will probably control almost sixty per cent of the press circulation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The statement then asks whether it matters. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it matters enormously. Murdoch himself said in 1977, `I think it would be a pity if I grew any bigger in Australia. There are now basically three groups in Australia, and that's too few already. If I were to grow bigger and take over one of the other groups-or be taken over-that would be against the public interest. I'd like there to be six groups. The fewer there are, the worse it is. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from Murdoch in 1977. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> John Norris, the former judge who inquired into press ownership in Victoria in 1981, stated the vital issue: concentration of ownership could lead to loss of diversity in opinion. It could also give a very few men `the power . . . to influence the outlooks and opinions of large numbers of people, and consequently the decisions made in society. </PARA>
<PARA>Would Murdoch use this power?</PARA>
<PARA>The papers will bring access to power. As Murdoch gives thumbs up or down to governments, political parties, individuals, philosophies and policies, so could his newspapers around the world. He can try to mould Australian society to his views. He is committed to deregulating business and labour. </PARA>
<PARA>He has succeeded. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>He has forecast that if Hawke `ducks the issues' such as `the inflexibility of the union structure in Australia', then `we'll be looking for an alternative' to Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said in 1987. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Murdoch is now a loyal American citizen, having sworn to `renounce and abjure' all allegiance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> How can someone who has done that try to influence public affairs in Australia? America's interests and Australia's can be very different. Malcolm Fraser, the former Prime Minister, wrote recently, `Let's say that Australia has a significant argument with the US and that argument involves trade or commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose there to suggest that it might be wheat or wool. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Is a US owner of Australia's media going to be interested in advancing Australia's arguments, or is he going to be interested in advancing the interests of the US, to whom he owes this primary loyalty, to whom he is legally committed?'</PARA>
<PARA>* * *</PARA>
<PARA>The chief issues raised here don't seem open to discussion in the twentyeight per cent of the daily press that Murdoch now owns. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1987. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>How much more serious is silence on vital public questions in sixty-five per cent of the press if he wins?</PARA>
<PARA> Hal Wootten, the Press Council Chairperson who resigned because of the council's impotence, wrote: `Journalists will lose their independence because there will be very few jobs to go to if they offend him. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this was touched on by my colleague the honourable member for Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the question, `How is the ordinary person affected?' is asked. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>We rely on the mass media for a healthy diversity of news and opinions on which to make our judgments, to act and to vote. We also rely on the media to broadcast our own concerns and problems and seek remedies. </PARA>
<PARA> The more ownership of newspapers, radio and TV is concentrated in the hands of a few, the greater is the potential to restrict the sources of news and opinions. </PARA>
<PARA> A proprietor who controlled a major proportion of the nation's mass circulation papers would wield terrifying power-power to decide what issues are discussed, and on what terms, power to set the political agenda, to make and break governments and politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Such monopoly power, as Hal Wootten pointed out, is a threat to freedom of speech which is the cornerstone of our democracy, and is therefore contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to address the plight of the Baltic states. As is well known, until 1917 the Baltic states formed part of the Russian Empire and, following the revolution in that country, they disengaged themselves from a disintegrating Tsarist Russia and declared themselves to be independent and democratic republics in 1918: Lithuania on 16 February, Estonia on 24 February and Latvia on 18 November of that year. Indeed, it is not well known but the small and inexperienced armies of Latvia and Lithuania actually repelled a minor assault by Bolshevik forces in 1919.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between the wars the states were internationally recognised. They had diplomatic and trade relations with the major Western powers and the Soviet Union and were accepted as members of the League of Nations. Until August 1939, as a result of the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, the three states were assigned-and I mean assigned-to the Soviet sphere of influence. </PARA>
<PARA> Although all three states did declare their neutrality at the outbreak of World War II, in September and October 1939 they were compelled to accept Soviet garrisons and in June 1940 the Soviet Union invaded without opposition. Immediately there was a purge of all so-called class enemies. While estimates of the numbers killed vary considerably, one authority puts the number at 61,000 Estonians, 34,000 Latvians and 38,500 Lithuanians. In Lithuania alone, the Lithuanians deported, including women and children, before the program was halted by the German invasion, were apparently only the first wave of a planned total of some 700,000 persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Nazi Germany invaded in 1941 and the three Baltic republics were reconquered by the Soviet Union in 1944-45. The Nazi period itself was particularly oppressive and in Estonia alone the Nazis killed in excess of 100,000 civilians. </PARA>
<PARA> The re-establishment of Soviet imperialism in 1944 brought a return to the policy of political repression. In 1945 some 40,000 Latvians were deported from the Courland area alone. Three years later another 60,000 followed and similar patterns occurred in Estonia and Latvia. Let it be said now, as it has always been said, that the coalition parties, unlike the Party on the other side of the House, have never recognised the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union. The large Russian elements in the population of Estonia and Latvia today date from the resettlements of this time and the period immediately following this. </PARA>
<PARA> The three Baltic states have all recently declared independence: Lithuania on 11 March 1990, Estonia on 30 March 1990 and Latvia on 4 May 1990. Each declaration has been in same way qualified. Estonia's was to mark the beginning of a transition to independence; Latvia declared independence but maintained most Soviet laws; and Lithuania's declaration was suspended in June following the imposition of an economic blockade by the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Mikhail Gorbachev has refused to acknowledge these declarations of independence. He publicly denounced the Lithuanians' declaration as `illegitimate and invalid'. Lithuania's attempts at formal negotiations were rejected. Similarly, the Lithuanian referendum, which gives a very clear indication of the will of the Lithuanian people, was not recognised by Moscow. More than 90 per cent of voters in Lithuania's advisory poll on 9 February supported independence. Latvia and Estonia held similar plebiscites on 3 March. In both states an overwhelming majority of voters voted in favour of independence. The first figures indicated that almost 80 per cent of voters in Estonia and 86 per cent in Latvia voted in favour of independence. Significantly, many non-Balts, Russians and Poles, for example, also voted for independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian policy is set out in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Official Guidelines, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia does not recognise de jure the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union, but we do question that the Soviet Union is in effective control of the Baltic territories. Contacts with individuals purporting to represent the governments of Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia should be confined to routine courtesies at social functions and there should be no acknowledgment of their claimed status. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian diplomatic missions are instructed to confine their contacts with Soviet officials purporting to represent the interests of the Baltic States to matters of a consular or humanitarian nature. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government's current reluctance to use the expression `right to independence' and the coalition's contrasting willingness to use it is, I believe, indicative of the different commitments of the two sides of this House to this cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, let me recast the plight that has been dug for the peoples of the Baltic states, with all its idiosyncrasies, in the light of the last two centuries of European history, which has been characterised by ideological passion, upheaval, disintegration and hypocrisy. The cycle of idealism and cynicism is well illustrated by the so-called Baltic republics of the Soviet Union, born of cultural traditions centuries old, having gone through tumultuous nineteenth century politics and the disintegration of the old order in Tsarist Russia and the subsequent emergent order of post First World War Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The brief period of independence that characterised the emergence of these tiny nation states was sufficient to forge again and to reconfirm the cultural, linguistic and national sentiments into very distinct and very vibrant geopolitical identities that both Nazi Germany on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other have endeavoured to crush since 1939. Indeed, it is one of the paradoxes of twentieth century history that the extreme right and the extreme left always seem to find a common cause when it comes to traditional issues of power and hegemony. In the case of the Baltic states, this was the product of the Nazi-Soviet agreement to divide Europe into spheres of interests, characterised by two seemingly completely disparate ideologies that ultimately shared one purpose-absolute power for the dominant elite. </PARA>
<PARA> The crushing of Nazi Germany immediately saw the replacement of one brutal dictatorship in the Baltic states with another. It seems almost as if the Soviets and the Nazis competed with each other in respect of the brutality inflicted on the local population, leading to a very understandable cynicism on the part of the Balts and, indeed, many others, in respect of the political claims of those two groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence the situation in the Baltic republics reflects the same old paradoxes of hypocrisy. On the one hand they are termed `republics', yet on the other they have no autonomy. They have no authority in terms of their own future. There is nothing republican about the Baltic states at present, other than that which they have endeavoured to formulate themselves against the centripetal power of Moscow in the endeavour to hold together what is in many ways the Tsarist regime in communist dress. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the centrifugal forces of democracy, nationalism, economic chaos and political disenchantment have rendered the entire Soviet bloc fragile and vulnerable. What is happening in the Baltic states is in many ways a reflection of what is happening throughout the Soviet grid. The various so-called republics, the constituent elements of the empire, are now seeking autonomous identity, not simply because of the economic failure of the empire as such, but because of a genuine desire to forge their own destinies rather than simply serve as vassals of an outmoded and discredited ideological doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of supporting the Baltic republics in their struggle for independence is not simply that of endorsing the desire of three very small states to rediscover their independence and to take their destiny into their own hands; more importantly, it reflects a general commitment to democracy and the right of all peoples to determine their own cultural and political destiny-something which we in this country take for granted. Of course, this has to be balanced by a whole host of economic, strategic and other factors that temper both the desire for and the desirability of the collapse of the Soviet empire and other similar empires. It is not simply a question of endorsing chaos for chaos's sake; rather, it is a question of appraising each case on its individual merits and considering the realisation of certain aspirations, whether they be in the Baltic states, Georgia, the Ukraine or, indeed, Russia itself. </PARA>
<PARA> By providing freedom to the Baltic states the Soviet Union necessarily invites a structural impasse. Yet one thing is for sure: in so far as the Soviet Union remains united because of the strength of the KGB and the Soviet Army rather than through the desire of its constituencies, its days are numbered and its legitimacy is certainly diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of endeavouring to hold together every aspect of the empire, the Soviet Union would better serve its own interests by forging a new political mandate which addresses not only its interests but the interests of its various constituent republics. This may mean a confederation, it could mean the hiving off of parts of the Soviet Union, such as the Baltic republics, Azerbaijan, Moldavia or Georgia. If this proves to be the case, then what is left of the Soviet Union may well turn out to be a far stronger entity through a greater cohesiveness and common purpose than the embattled, fatigued and ultimately illegitimate colossus of the current empire. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of the Baltic states goes far beyond the matter of the rights of small states. The Baltic states are, of course, tiny, and, many would argue, insignificant in the greater scheme of things. By the same token, in terms of world affairs, although our land mass is large, we in Australia are in fact tiny and in many ways I guess insignificant in the greater scheme of things. By not having sensitivity to the plight of the Baltic states we invite others to take the same attitude to us. This is not to demean the status or the interests of the Soviet Union, but to point out that as we move into the twenty-first century we need to abandon the failed ideologies and the failed political structures of the nineteenth century and look to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this country can do a limited amount to support the Baltic states in their fight for self-determination and democracy. It is very important that both sides of the House adopt a bipartisan attitude to this issue and declare in the strongest possible terms our support for the freedom of these three Baltic states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This chamber hosted, on 21 and 22 January, what I consider to be the most momentous and the most heartfelt debate in my 10 years of parliamentary experience, when we considered the need for and the justice of Australian involvement in war in the Persian Gulf. This week the tone is different, but the matter of equal-no, greater-import, as we all share a deep and heartfelt relief at the cessation of fighting in Iraq and Kuwait; both those members who supported the United Nations-United States allied action and those who did not. We also all share pride in the men and women of the forces who represented Australia so well, and in the relief of the families who welcome them safely home. This pride is given substance by the award of the Active Service Medal to recognise the courage of our servicemen and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But it is timely that we now consider the next aspect of our involvement: our response to the consequences of that war. The reality of the Gulf war is that for over a million people its effects are not over, nor will they be for some time. What we must now debate is the terms under which the nations of the world, including Australia, wish to negotiate the just peace to which we committed ourselves before pursuing the path which we did in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) set the tone for such a debate during his report to the House on 5 March, when he demonstrated his awareness of and sympathy for the plight of the people of Kuwait and Iraq, and other speakers confirmed the depth of their own concern for and sensitivity to the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also timely to consider the victims from the ranks of the allied nations, and from Iraq and Kuwait whose loved ones did not return. Officials in Washington estimate that 79 Americans died in combat, and 25,000 to 50,000 Iraqi soldiers-some say more, some say less. Respected military historian, Colonel Trevor Duprey, is reported as estimating the total number of Iraqis killed or wounded as between 100,000 and 150,000, with a quarter to a third of the total killed. This is a tragic addition to the 150,000 to 340,000 Iraqi people reported as killed in the Iran-Iraq war, finalised only in 1988. It is not only timely but also our responsibility to ponder the casualties, not only of the battlefields of the Middle East but of those across the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made in this House of the domino theory when applied to war. We should now consider application of the domino theory to the repercussions of war. The tentacles of this war have reached out and grasped hundreds of thousands of people in the poorer countries of the Third World. The World Bank estimated early in February that the Gulf war to that date had cost developing nations $US30 billion, a loss equal to 60 per cent of all the aid they receive and on which they depend for their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Conference on Trade and Development has estimated that Third World countries face an increase in oil costs of 110 per cent or $480m over the year 1990-91, producing increased transport and thus food prices in countries where people are already famished. Such economic pressures translate quickly into severe effects at the grass roots level, as evidenced in Mozambique, where critical airlifts of food aid to Niassa Province have been cancelled because of a 40 per cent rise in fuel costs. People will die. So the network of victims spreads, as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Sudan, Ethiopia and other Third World nations are brought even closer to death by malnutrition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council for Overseas Aid reports that the Gulf war has imposed additional hardships on Third World countries, with large numbers of migrant workers displaced, on those with high exports to Kuwait and Iraq, and on oil importers, as it has on African countries facing tragic famines whose problems have been overshadowed and given low priority by the world community. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not forget the people of Kuwait, who suffered before the savage onslaught of Saddam Hussein, nor the grief suffered by their loved ones. But nor should we lose sight of the broader picture. The pain, the damage to the environment through oil spills and oil fires, the refugees, the malnutrition, the crushing of human spirit and bodily life arising from the massive, long term devastation of this war-these are too vast and too tragic to record here adequately and within the limitations of our language. </PARA>
<PARA> Under article 50 of the United Nations (UN) Charter, compensation is payable to countries affected by UN Security Council action. The problem for UN member states is to meet the claims for assistance that have already been lodged, plus the ongoing mop-up costs, including dealing with the enormous damage to the environment of burning oil wells and oil spills, the final cost of which is yet to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Community Aid Abroad (CAA), which ranks amongst the high credibility non-government organisations working in the underdeveloped world, confirms that not only the frontline Gulf states-including Iraq and Kuwait-but more than 10 Third World countries affected by the war must have additional financial assistance if they are to survive the crisis; not funds diverted from the 1991 aid budget. This is one of the concerns. Australia is one of the nations that is always up front in providing aid that gets through, in providing cash aid in crisis situations. We have sent people to the Gulf to look at treating the affects of the oil spill. But on-hand cash flow is needed now to keep people alive. </PARA>
<PARA> CAA proposes that this money could be provided by additional bilateral and multinational aid; a supplementary fund financed by countries benefiting from increased oil revenue or savings; a trust fund financed by the selling of International Monetary Fund gold reserves, such as happened during the oil crisis of 1973; and funding the compensation mechanism provided under article 50 of the UN Charter. </PARA>
<PARA> According to my information, these steps have not been followed. But the bipartisan majority support for Australian involvement in the Gulf should now be thrown behind the Prime Minister and the Government as they formulate their practical response to the aftermath mop-up. One reason that strong majority support for foreign aid has not yet emerged in Australia is that some people have seen non-Australians as outside their own area of responsibility. Thus, `Look after your own backyard' has become part of our colloquial language. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the graphic reporting of war in the Middle East, as pointed out by World Vision, often concentrated on weaponry rather than on people, it must surely have brought home to us that this is our backyard. It is time for all Australians to respond to the need of the poorest of our neighbours when allocating tax revenue and supporting governments. If we can do it to meet a crisis situation, to meet one reality of war, the military engagement, we can do it to meet another-the mop-up which is part of the reality of war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve on behalf of the residents of Western Australia. I wish to discuss today some of the issues surrounding the visit to Western Australia in recent days by the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, Mr Brian Burke and, in relation to that visit, the statements recorded in the media attributed to Mr Burke and the responses to those comments about who paid for the services of convicted telephone tapper, Robert Smith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two issues immediately arise from this. The first is: who is telling the truth in relation to those comments? The second is: is it right and proper for a serving ambassador to participate, in controversial circumstances, in public affairs within Australia? Arising, supplementary to that, is the question: is Brian Burke an appropriate person to represent the people of Australia as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See? Should there be a code of conduct for ambassadors as a result of the controversy surrounding Mr Brian Burke's visit to Australia and those comments that were recorded in the media? Is the Federal Government, by virtue of its lack of action in relation to the Burke affair, merely prepared to tolerate the scandals associated with the ambassador?</PARA>
<PARA> Ambassador Burke arrived back in Australia on 24 February, ostensibly for a two-week visit. The West Australian reported that Mr Burke's visit was to talk to his solicitors and to do some preparatory work for the Royal Commission. On 27 February, Mr Burke appeared on the PM program on the ABC and was asked by Alan Carpenter, in relation to the activities of convicted telephone tapper Robert Smith, the following:</PARA>
<PARA>He was working for the Government when he was involved in collecting material on Ross Lightfoot and Ian Laurance, wasn't he?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burke responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, he was, but he wasn't doing that for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Carpenter asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Who was he doing it for?</PARA>
<PARA>Burke replied:</PARA>
<PARA>He was doing that for the Labor Party. At no time did I ask him to do anything improper, or anything certainly that could be considered to be illegal. As far as the references to BB are concerned, some of them appear to me to make sense, in that they refer to times when I spoke to him about different trips. But other times they don't appear to relate to me or make any sense in so far as his work is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of those comments made on the ABC program, the WA Labor Party strongly denied Mr Burke's version of events for 1987 and, in particular, it repudiated Brian Burke's statement that the ALP had in fact paid for Smith's activities. Senator Michael Beahan, who was then the State Secretary of the State ALP, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Smith had only been hired to sweep the Labor Party's headquarters for listening devices. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that there had been no other contact between the Party and Smith and he did not know why Brian Burke had suggested otherwise. Senator Beahan said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't know what he is talking about. I don't understand why he is putting it that way. </PARA>
<PARA>The current State Secretary of the ALP, Chris Evans, said he was taken aback by Mr Burke's comments. He confirmed that Smith had, in fact, done periodical security checks of the Labor Party's Beaufort Street headquarters, but said that he was never employed to `monitor, follow, bug or investigate anyone'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to put these events into the context of the heady days of the events of 1987, when State Superannuation Board Chairman, Len Brush, was charged by the WA Police with corruption and forgery over the State Superannuation Board's dealings with businessman Robert Martin. Len Brush's wife, Brenda, who was Brian Burke's principal private secretary, issued a statement following the comments attributed to Senator Beahan and Chris Evans. She stated that in early 1987 she was one of those responsible for operating the account from which Mr Smith was paid. She went on to allege that Senator Beahan knew of the fund and had general supervision of it, along with former Premier Brian Burke. Of interest in particular was Mrs Brush's claim that:</PARA>
<PARA>Michael may not have known the details of the transactions that went through the account, but that was determined simply by the interest he took in it on a day-to-day basis. It is absolutely wrong for Michael to say that Smith was not paid from Labor Party funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The question as to who was responsible for Smith's employment and direction is further clouded by the evidence of Vince Shervington, who was Brian Burke's former driver, when he told a Western Australian parliamentary Legislative Council select committee in December that Brian Burke had instructed him to pass messages to Robert Smith. Specifically, Shervington stated that Brian had instructed him to tell Smith to `Get something on Mr Lightfoot and Mr Laurance'. </PARA>
<PARA> The great question arising from this sordid affair, in which the people of Western Australia have a grave interest, is which senior Labor Party figure is in fact telling the truth. Is it former Secretary and now Senator Michael Beahan and current Secretary Chris Evans, or is it former Premier and current Ambassador to Ireland Brian Burke?</PARA>
<PARA> The apparent disinterest shown by the Federal Government in this affair, an affair which has very striking similarities to the Watergate affair in the 1970s in the United States, which led to the downfall of President Nixon--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Burkegate; quite so. The apparent disinterest is exemplified by Foreign Minister Senator Gareth Evans's comment yesterday to the Senate when he was asked by Senator Campbell whether he would undertake to investigate the contradictory statements made by Mr Bourke and Senator Beahan: Senator Evans refused to make any such investigation. Earlier, Senator Evans had told the Senate that he did not intend `to keep pace with the movements of all the ambassadors in the 90-odd posts which we administer around the world'. That comment was in response to a question from Senator Durack which sought clarification of Senator Evans's earlier response to Senator Hill, when he told the Senate that there were no manuals or guidelines for ambassadors' conduct or behaviour. Presumably the only policy as to ambassadorial conduct is Senator Evans's assertion to the Senate that we rely on the good sense, dignity and intelligence of the ambassadors concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This leads me to the second issue, in view of Mr Burke's controversial involvement in domestic public affairs in recent days. Since his return to Australia on 27 February it is quite obvious that the Government cannot rely on his good sense, dignity and intelligence because his comments and the circumstances in which he made them were a public relations fiasco, to put it mildly, both for Mr Burke and for the standing and reputation of Australia overseas. It is clear that if the Federal Government is prepared to tolerate Mr Burke's continued presence as the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, it must introduce a written code of conduct to prevent a repetition of the events in Perth in the last 12 days or so. However, the real issue is this: is the Federal Government prepared to continue to tolerate the scandals associated with its Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See?</PARA>
<PARA> One can only speculate as to what prevents the Federal Government from doing the right thing in relation to Mr Burke's continued role as Ambassador to Ireland. It is speculation, but perhaps one reason may lie in the level of factional support that Mr Burke clearly retains within the ALP both Statewise and federally. But as far as the people of Western Australia are concerned, and the people of Australia for that matter, they demand to know why the Government will not act now to stand down and recall the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, Mr Brian Burke, as a result of the continuing scandals that are associated with the activities of convicted telephone tapper Robert Smith during those heady days of the events of 1987. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on a matter of great injustice to a constituent of mine and I would like to bring the relevant information forward to this Parliament. My constituent-who at this stage I would like to remain nameless, to protect his privacy-is suffering from a rare disease known as hairy cell leukaemia. According to my constituent, his specialist had recommended that he be treated with a drug known as Interferon Alfa 2A or Interferon Alfa 2B to help him maintain a full quality of life. Available in Australia for the last three to four years, this drug has been described as the wonder drug for sufferers of hairy cell leukaemia. Interferon Alfa 2B is manufactured in Australia by Schering-Plough under the brand name of Intron A, and Interferon Alfa 2A is manufactured by Roche under the name Roferon-A. According to my constituent, this drug varies in price from $58 to $60 for each one millilitre injection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that neither Intron A nor Roferon-A are listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), which is why he must pay such an exorbitant price for this drug. However, after researching this a little further, I have now been told that Schering-Plough Pty Ltd was given marketing approval by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal for Intron A for use by hairy cell leukaemia sufferers. What is more, I have now been informed that this drug was recommended for listing by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for sufferers of hairy cell leukaemia. However, and this is my grievance, the pharmaceutical companies declined to put the drug on the PBS list because, `of the limited market it served'. Time and again we see the greed of these pharmaceutical companies take over from compassion. How much is a human life worth to these companies? After all, is not helping to save lives what a pharmaceutical company is meant to be all about?</PARA>
<PARA> According to my constituent, 400 new cases of hairy cell leukaemia were diagnosed in the United States of America in 1990. There are no statistics relating to the sufferers of this disease in Australia. However, the estimated number in our country, if we are going to do comparisons with the population of the United States, is certainly very low. If the Interferon Alfa 2A and 2B drug can help these people fulfil what life they have left, then surely pharmaceutical manufacturing companies should allow the drug to be PBS listed.</PARA>
<PARA> My constituent informs me that he must pay $580 a month for his injections of this drug. He has had to have his spleen removed due to this disease and he has, consequently, had to be pensioned off as an invalid. He receives a mere $143.70 a fortnight and his wife, who went to work to supplement their family income, brings home $278 a week. On this money my constituent is expected to pay $580 a month just for the drug as well as keep up with all other medical expenses and also the cost of raising his family. </PARA>
<PARA> Interferon is a highly purified protein containing 165 amino acids. It is obtained from a clone of E coli, which is a genetically engineered bacterium containing DNA that codes for the human protein. According to MIMS Annual 1990-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The results of several studies show that, once bound to the cell membrane, Interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that includes the induction of certain enzymes. It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to Interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus infected cells (and) suppression of cell proliferation . . . These activities possibly contribute to Interferon's therapeutic effects. </PARA>
<PARA>It is because this drug, in lay terms, helps the white blood cells fight disease that Interferon is used to treat selected acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. However, I have been told that these AIDS sufferers, while being treated in large public hospitals such as Sydney's Royal North Shore and St Vincents hospitals, receive their injections of this drug for free. While I do not believe AIDS patients should be denied this benefit, I do believe that the few people in Australia who are unfortunate enough to have the rare disease of hairy cell leukaemia, for whom the drug was initially brought to Australia anyway, should be provided with the same opportunity. Even if the drug were not supplied free, hairy cell leukaemia patients would be enormously assisted if the manufacturing companies allowed this drug to be listed under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> According again to my constituent, once a patient is started on Roferon-A, for example, he must stay on that drug and cannot go on to Intron A. Consequently, it is important for both Roche and Schering-Plough Pty Ltd to allow their Interferon based drugs to go on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme list. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituent is using Roferon-A and he must have it ordered specially, for him alone, by his local pharmacist. Unfortunately, this drug can be purchased by him only in lots of five. That is, my constituent cannot buy a single dose of this drug if he has the $58; he must buy five doses at a time at a cost of $290. As I have said, to help him each month he must have 10 doses, which means that he is now paying $580. My constituent can no longer afford this wonder drug. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to this House: how many other sufferers of hairy cell leukaemia face such a grim future? Action must be taken now on this matter; not next month and not next year. My constituent and others like him throughout Australia need that help. </PARA>
<PARA> His case was discovered following a leg infection in November 1989. That infection would not heal. He went to our local Fairfield Hospital and was told he would have to have an operation. He was then informed that he had to have further tests, and in December 1989 he went to Liverpool Hospital, where they took those tests and informed him that everything was all right. In January 1990 his disease progressed and when he went for further tests at Liverpool he was told that his white blood cell count was very bad. The hospital apologised, but the previous doctor gave the man someone else's blood test, which I found, even at that stage, a disgrace. He has had many visits since. He is now, as I said, being treated by a specialist for this disease. He has had to have operations not only on his leg but also to remove the spleen. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this man, this man's family and others like them should not be given the benefit of a drug which can not only keep such people alive but provide for them a quality of life. It should be provided for them and I will follow this up both with the appropriate Minister and with this Parliament to make sure that action is taken in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I intend to bring to the attention of the House an issue of great significance to all decent Australians who pay their taxes regularly, be they pay as you earn taxpayers or honest business people. I refer to those tax avoidance schemes in the area of withholding tax, some dating back to 1978, the very longevity of which is a disgrace for a government purporting to be the champion of the common man and for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) who, immediately prior to the 1990 election, stated in Taxation in Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . loopholes and tax preferences meant that those better off benefited at the expense of the general tax-paying community. The Government has turned that position around. We now have a much fairer system . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said before in this House, there is nothing fair about the Government's continued failure to pursue the abuse of these withholding tax arrangements which have been fashioned for the more affluent and also, sometimes, for the more dubious elements of the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people believe and some pretend that all major tax avoidance schemes finished when part IVa of the Income Tax Assessment Act was introduced in 1981. However, this is plainly not the case, as I am sure members of this House will agree after hearing the documented evidence to the contrary which I am about to present. Most of this documentation was only very recently obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As we moved forward into the 1980s other schemes emerged which may be called the `out of the harbour schemes'. This title was coined by Mrs Barbara Smith of the Phillip Institute of Technology in Melbourne, after her recent courageous and wide ranging research into the area of withholding tax abuse exposed publicly the existence and enormity of the tax revenue thereby dissipated. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates of the revenue lost to the Commonwealth from schemes improperly taking advantage of withholding tax vary significantly. However, it is estimated that up to $1 billion a year in tax is being evaded or avoided through such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 these schemes were clearly identified by the Australian Taxation Office in Melbourne. In that year, the Melbourne branch sent out 700 standard letters to trustees where returns had shown that trust income had been distributed to non-resident beneficiaries and there were doubts as to the bona fides of such arrangements. I quote from paragraph 2 of one such letter dated 15 April 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not accepted that the arrangements made by you as a trustee effectively bestowed entitlement to a share of the net income of the above trust on the non-resident beneficiaries specified in the trustees' resolution. Accordingly, . . . (we)-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Taxation Office-</PARA>
<PARA>seek prompt payment of the full amount of tax assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>These letters were withdrawn after representations to the highest level of the Federal Labor Government and the most senior level of the Canberra Tax Office. This led to intervention in the affairs of the Melbourne Taxation Office, which then wrote letters to all trustees telling them to disregard the original letters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have reason to believe that representations were made by Mr Mark Leibler and that the name `Mr Leibler' has been deleted from the Taxation Office telex entitled `Trusts with Non-resident Beneficiaries', which I will later seek to table in this House. Certainly, Mr Leibler was referred to in the publication Taxation in Australia of August 1986 as being `critical of this approach'-referring to the 700 letters-while working with the Canberra tax liaison group. Subsequently, on 28 August 1990, a complex audit strategy was devised to assist the national office task force to investigate taxpayers using the withholding tax system to avoid payment of income tax. The task force recommended that the blanket 10 per cent tax rate available to all non-residents should be dispensed with. There were approximately 1,200 potential cases, of which 256 had been identified as requiring further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 September 1990, a letter was sent from the Melbourne Tax Office to the Canberra Tax Office on the use of interest withholding tax provisions to avoid income tax; that is, section 128d cases. This letter refers to pre- and post-part IVa cases, some of which were over 10 years old. I quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Discussions with officers from the Melbourne branch indicate that tax minimisation through trusts distributing income to non-residents was identified during the period 1978-80. </PARA>
<PARA>No assessments were issued pending advice from Canberra. Minutes of the Overseas Beneficiary Case Strategy Conference held in Melbourne on 18 October 1990 indicate the enormity of the problem. The stated objective was to develop a strategy plan to clean up non-resident beneficiary cases, with a target time of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> To give honourable members some idea of the revenue involved, of the 1,200 possible cases to be investigated, the section describes Dandenong, where the settlement negotiations had been commenced on only 20 cases. The potential revenue gained was $8m, or an average of $400,000 a case. Yet, in Taxation in Australia of March 1990, the Treasurer stated that all was well. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past seven years, the Government has been vigilant in its efforts to bring integrity into the taxation system . . . We now have a much fairer system and one which encourages efficient economic decisions rather than the wasteful pursuit of tax loopholes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Even as late as last month, in February 1991, a memo from Mr Vince Mitchell, First Assistant Commissioner, advised Mr Brian Nolan, Second Commissioner of Taxation, that the Melbourne branch was proposing to issue 900 section 264 notices relating to withholding tax to obtain information to ascertain whether the affairs of particular trustees should be subjected to intensive audit action. A high proportion of the cases, in fact over 50 per cent, involve beneficiaries residing in Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Honesty and integrity must be demonstrated from the top. Yet since 1985, the Melbourne Tax Office has been prevented from carrying out its duty by its political and bureaucratic superiors in Canberra. It is to be hoped that with further evidence of `out of the harbour' schemes at hand, the Melbourne Tax Office will be allowed to proceed, justice will at last be done, and honest Australian taxpayers will no longer be as disadvantaged. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the relevant documents that I have referred to throughout this speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to report to the House on a visit I made recently to Japan with two of my colleagues, as guests of the Government of Japan. In the time available to me, I will give some of my observations of that visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We travelled reasonably extensively throughout Japan, visiting Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Nara National Park, Yokohama, Tsukuba Science City, and Atami National Park. I am very grateful to the Japanese Government for making available to us not only excellent interpreters, but a whole range of people with whom we could sit and discuss matters of mutual concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I will illustrate some matters that might be useful in comparing ourselves with the Japanese, especially on the question of standard of living. My conclusion is that, while Australia has an admirable standard of living which at the moment we are struggling to afford, the Japanese have a less admirable standard of living, but it is one that they can well afford. There are some marvellous examples of this. As I was exiting Tokyo, I was talking to a Qantas Airways Ltd steward about the costs of transport from Tokyo to the airport. He said that to take a Qantas jet crew from the airport some 40 or 50 kilometres into Tokyo costs $600. The cost is made up of the hire of the bus and the enormous cost of the tolls on the freeways. </PARA>
<PARA> As innocent Australians, we looked at those sorts of costs as we were taken in and out of various parts of Tokyo. The cost of going through some tollgates was up to $20. An ordinary one would be $6 or $8. So the cost of moving around Tokyo is absolutely phenomenal. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited Tsukuba Science City, which is about 60 kilometres outside Tokyo. We looked at some land outside that city. We saw a plot of land which contained a two-storey, fairly modestly built sort of home. I cannot think of the exact measurements, but it would not have been more than 40 feet by 40 feet. The cost of that land and that building was around half a million dollars. I think we have to weigh up the costs to the Japanese of existing in what is undoubtedly a very wealthy country and compare it with the costs of the lifestyle that we as Australians are generally able to afford. It seems to me that we should be most grateful for our ability to live in this country, but most enviable of the ability of the Japanese to produce as they do. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited one of the Nissan Motor Co. Ltd plants at Kanagawa. Travelling from Tokyo through Yokohama, the overwhelming impression-after driving for 40, 50 or 60 kilometres without a break-is of a massive industrial complex. Around Tokyo Bay, in that 40, 50 or 60 kilometres there would probably be twice the output of the entire nation of Australia packed into that very small area. So one must be impressed by that. But also packed into that very tiny area are 12 to 15 million Japanese. The compactness of Japanese life has to be seen to be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> When we visited the Nissan plant, we saw that the most prominent thing was that it is based right on the wharf-it points overseas. The whole point about Nissan, Toyota and other companies is that they export, and they export massively. The plant was set up by the British. It was an old Leyland plant set up in the 1960s. As we walked through that plant the thing that we noticed most was that every single piece of equipment in that plant, from the very large, heavy equipment making the presses for panels for the cars, down to the robots and the crates which carried parts, was Japanese manufactured. </PARA>
<PARA> So except for the dear old Leyland plant frame, which the British had built in the 1960s, the Japanese had put every piece of equipment into that plant. They had some other pieces of investment which intrigued me. They had a storage system whereby they would drive in any model of car and warehouse it within a couple of minutes using a computer program to place the cars away in any sort of level. They could stack, I think, several thousand cars in that warehouse ready for the day when it would be shipped off to Australia, the United States, or Europe. They could pull out any single car at will within four minutes, according to that program. That beats the hell out of trying to shift a hundred cars here and there across the wharf to get the one you want to make up the numbers to send overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that you do not even begin to make that sort of investment in sophisticated warehousing until you have already got a significant market and a significantly powerful and profitable organisation like Nissan. As Australians, I do not think we should go there agog and say, `What a wonderful warehouse that is'. Australians will never reach the sorts of profit levels and the throughput of cars that would enable us to allow that sort of sophisticated warehousing. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to make those sorts of observations each time we go to Japan and compare ourselves with the Japanese. There are pluses; there are things that startle us; there is great wealth; there is brilliance in their technology; there is an ability to accumulate capital; and so forth. I do not think by comparison we ought to say that Australians lack all those sorts of things. All in proportion, all at scale, Australians have a tremendous sophistication, a lesser number and smaller sized firms which do well in the markets in which they can cope. We have a talented and disciplined work force, and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a lot belies the way the Japanese live. There are some lovely illustrations. We were talking to people about the sorts of standards of holidays and overaward payments that Japanese workers are nominally attributed-and I say nominally because it was put to us that whilst the Japanese worker has the right to a four-week holiday per year, it was not the done thing ever to take it. While there are these sorts of nominal equivalents between our workers and their workers, in Japan it was not considered to be the right thing not to work late every night without being paid at a rate of time and a half. It was not considered the right thing for a worker actually to take four weeks leave. It was not considered the right thing for a worker ever to be off on a sickie. </PARA>
<PARA> There is this massive imposing discipline, as we could observe it, on the Japanese work force. That is a cultural thing. I do not know why it arises. I cannot pretend to analyse it. Japan was soundly defeated in a war, it had very low expectations, its workers were not used to consuming a great deal. I guess it is true, therefore, that they were able to turn their country into a very productive one because, in a sense, they had no other competing interests. There was no great space in which to build. There were no great materials that they could allocate to housing. Their expectations were low because they simply had to go back to the basics and rebuild their cities, water supplies, sewerage depots, roads and the whole thing. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to appreciate where the Japanese have come from in the last 40 years in order to understand why they have reached such a powerful financial level of achievement, but that does not mean to say that they are anywhere near equivalent in terms of a more general and thoroughgoing comparison of living standards between Japanese and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> They have certainly been fairly tough on their own people, even to the most humble of commodities. We know that one is not allowed to import rice into Japan, even though the price of rice is some six to seven times higher than the price for which Australians could send rice there. So they are quite prepared, because of a rural gerrymander and other cultural elements associated with rice growing in Japan, to have their own people make significant sacrifices about even basic food costs in order to keep driving this massive machine. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are just some illustrations that I have been able to give in this short time. I have been stimulated enough, at the kind invitation of the Japanese people, to keep thinking and making these comparisons and to read a great deal about Japan's society, its people and its economy, so that, hopefully, I will have some further contributions to make on our relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today relates to the effect of inflation on the Australian farm sector. It is my conviction that largely because of ignorance about the real costs and the impact of inflation, coupled with a reluctance in Australia to accept the pain involved in overcoming it, we have allowed the problem to go largely unaddressed and, as a result, huge damage to the farming community of Australia has been felt and continues to be felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Farming people often talk about the declining terms of trade that confront them. Others refer to this problem in terms of the cost-price squeeze. Regrettably, all too often the gut reaction is to bemoan the prices side of the equation, without according due recognition to the cost side. Yet I genuinely believe that the most important thing that can be done for the small business sector in general, and the farm component of it in particular, is to rein in costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of the nature of those cost increases is not particularly hard to find. I recall during the 1989-90 financial year being told by a farmer who has his operation computerised and is able to keep a very close track of costs that whilst the consumer price index increases for that year came out at something like 8 per cent, his farm costs rose in the order of 14 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I can relate this sort of outcome to some figures from our own family operation. I recall buying a four-wheel drive Toyota in the early 1980s which cost $8,000 registered on the road with a tray top. We replaced it six years later, by which time the cost of an equivalent vehicle had risen to $24,000 registered on the road with a tray. That translated, in terms of the commodities that we produce, from a value of about 20 steers or 70 tonnes of wheat to 50 steers or 240 tonnes of wheat. At the same time, the cost of a 225-horsepower American tractor rose from about $75,000 to $130,000, while the price of wheat remained stable or declined substantially in real terms. I would not be brave enough to do the exercise on what it would cost me in terms of today's value of wheat, given the price collapses that took place towards the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Loton, as the then chief of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, told a gathering that I was present at towards the end of last year that Australia traditionally enters a recession as an inefficient and lethargic economy and remains that way throughout the trough, without learning the lessons of its mistakes until an upturn in commodity prices drags it out of the hole. The great problem with this rather slovenly approach is that over a period of economic peaks and troughs we continue to progressively ratchet ourselves downwards, as we gradually undermine our competitive capacity. Other economies look to correct structural weaknesses during slowdowns and emerge leaner, more efficient and more competitive, whereas we fail to follow their example to the great cost of living standards, with the additional cost, of course, showing up in terms of our burgeoning international debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently put before this House some figures which showed that the cost of money in Australia had been in recent years a major inhibiting factor on our productivity and hence our competitiveness. That applies particularly to the farm sector. The exercise related to an example of a $100,000 loan drawn down in 1983, which was when the Hawke Labor Government came to power, to be repaid at the rate of $10,000 per annum-that is a typical small business loan. So by 1990, we can assume that the borrower would have repaid $70,000 and would still have $30,000 outstanding. On British interest rates, the borrower would have repaid interest of $59,000 over and above his capital repayments; on American interest rates, $43,000; on Japanese interest rates, about $25,000; and in Australia, no less than $84,000. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of crippling inhibition on our capacity to improve our productivity is now showing up in very real ways. It needs to be clearly understood that our high inflation figures have been both the teller of the weaknesses that have caused those high interest rates and a very large portion of the actual floor, keeping those interest rates at such horrific levels for so long. Inflation forces up rates of interest at the same time as it saps competitiveness. Farmers cannot, for example, export their cost increases to their foreign markets. Inflation distorts investment patterns in favour of the speculative at the expense of the solid long-term productive exercise; it strips away incentives to save; and ultimately it undermines a country's financial and economic stability. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects on the farm sector in this country are particularly devastating. It is not simply a matter of its impact on the cost of money. There is also the question of the cumulative effects of cost increases over a long time. There is no doubt that the creeping nature of the problem hides its full impact from the farm community, just as it does from the community at large. It is like the old story that runs along the lines that if you throw a frog into boiling water, he will hop straight out, thus preserving his life, but if you put him in cold water and heat it very slowly, he will stay in until it is too late, and he dies. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of all this is that whilst we cannot ultimately hope to control the prices that the world pays us for commodities such as wheat and wool, we can and we should exercise control over the costs of production. In fact, no better and no more important area of assistance in terms of both the medium term and the long term can be found for Australia's beleaguered farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) would have us believe that he has effectively tackled inflation, and as evidence he would point towards the lower outcomes that we have enjoyed-if that is the right word-in recent times. Of course, the truth is that those better figures have been achieved at the cost of driving the economy into the ground by using interest rates of an order that have killed off all our export sectors and their chances of growth, as well as causing massive hardship across the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government does not want people to look at is the question of the underlying weaknesses, particularly in the labour market, which have contributed so hugely to inflation. Nor does it want any- body to focus on its record of reform-or lack of reform-in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The classic textbook description of the cause of inflation is that it results from too much money chasing too few goods. In other words, demand during much of the 1980s hopelessly outstripped the nation's productive capacity. The accord has contributed to the perpetuation of this great Australian failing, particularly in the manufacturing sector, of allowing pay increases to respond not to productive capacity and the ability of industry to pay and the economy to pay, but on the basis of increases in the cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The wage-price spiral, the dog chasing its tail, under Labor's accord, has ironically hurt the very people it was supposed to help-by driving down living standards. But it has hurt those outside the protective mantle of the accord even more. Ask the unemployed; ask the small businessman facing bankruptcy; ask the farmer whose costs have left him utterly unable to confront the present crisis because the graph of declining prices has crossed over the graph of exploding costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The proper answer to the problem of too much money chasing too few goods is to raise productivity and limit unit labour costs, and indeed drive them down. That is not to say that we should drive wage levels down; not at all. It is to say that we should wind back unit labour costs, because Australia's performance by international standards in this regard has been abysmal and continues to be abysmal. This is essentially because the trade union movement-the industrial relations club, if you like-and this Government do not want to tackle the hard issues of effective industrial relations reform. They want to leave the sacred cows grazing in the paddock of centralised control of wages and conditions called the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that this came to an end. It is now obvious that Australians are fast coming to the realisation that things must change, and increasingly the union movement stands in the way of the reforms needed to boost productivity and is seen to do so by Australian workers. That is why only 30.8 per cent of them now choose to belong to a union in the private sector work force. A union official acknowledged the other day that union membership, in his view, would probably slip below 10 per cent if unionism was genuinely voluntary in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> SPC Ltd is the proof of this disregard for the value of union involvement in the workplace. Workers now want the right to control their own future. There is a great deal more that remains to be said on this subject but I must conclude for time reasons. In so doing, I want to indicate that the primary key to cracking inflation in Australia is to change community attitudes and expectations. The Government must start to lead in that regard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Fisher)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.35)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most members, I imagine, I find that a large number of the inquiries which come into my office relate to the subject of immigration. Normally it is a rather heartless task because it is often the case that we are unable to offer a great deal of assistance. With an immigration program of 120,000 to 140,000 people per year, and something well in excess of 1.5 million people each year trying to immigrate to Australia, the sheer mathematics dictate that most people are disappointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it becomes very galling when a case of apparent flagrant abuse of the immigration processes comes to one's attention. This abuse has been well documented and substantially established through both documentary and other evidence, but the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Federal Police refuse to take any particular action. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw the House's attention to such a case. It involves the apparent abuse of the use of the marriage provisions under the Migration Act. Honourable members would be aware that marriage is one of the few categories where there is an automatic right for a spouse to come into Australia. As such, the intending spouse does not have to go through the same sort of scrutiny in order to gain points to gain selection in the floating pool for deciding immigration applicants. The applicant does have to go through the normal checks to make sure that it is in fact a genuine marriage and there is no medical reason or other character reasons which would prohibit the visa and residency being granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been approached by Mr Antonio Landicho who sponsored into Australia a woman for the purpose of marrying her. He had known the woman for some time. He sponsored her under this marriage provision as a fiancee and she arrived in Australia on 26 June 1988. As the couple had planned, they married some three days later on 25 June 1988. Unfortunately for Mr Landicho, his bride left the matrimonial home immediately after the marriage and there was no marriage at all. Honourable members might say that is unfortunate, but obviously these things can happen. They may never have got on and it is just one of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landicho did not quite leave it at that and he started to make some proper inquiries of authorities in the Philippines about the background of this woman. As it turned out, he discovered through employing a solicitor in the Philippines that the woman involved was already married. That means, of course, that not only did she misrepresent her position to Mr Landicho, she misrepresented it to the Department of Immigration and under Australian laws she has, at least on the face of it, committed the crime of bigamy. </PARA>
<PARA> Not satisfied with that, Mr Landicho had other inquiries undertaken in the Philippines and discovered that a lot of other information that the woman had supplied both to him and to the Immigration Department was false. This related to her employment background as well as other personal details. After he had some confirmation of this information-this was in about August 1988-he contacted the Immigration Department and drew its attention to the fact that it would appear that this woman was a bigamist and had seriously misrepresented the facts that led to her being allowed to enter Australia and being granted residency. He then received advice from the Immigration Department that he would need to supply it with a little more than that. So he did. He got the marriage certificate certified and managed to track down the woman's existing husband in the Philippines. Honourable members may not be aware that there is at the moment no provision for divorce in the Philippines. So on the face of it, this is a fairly strong case for bigamy. </PARA>
<PARA> The case becomes a little stronger in that he made an application to the Family Court of Australia in order to have the marriage declared a nullity on the basis of bigamy. He put forward his evidence to the Family Court and the Family Court granted that decree. Admittedly, the criteria which is used by the Family Court in deciding whether a marriage should be regarded null and void on the grounds of bigamy would be different from those needed to establish the criminal offence of bigamy under Commonwealth law, but certainly on the face of it, again it would seem a fairly strong case. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landicho supplied to the Department of Immigration and to the Australian Federal Police the decree granted by the Family Court. They then wanted more information from him. So again, at his own expense he had inquiries undertaken in Australia. He discovered the woman's current employer and her current address and he supplied that information to the Department of Immigration and to the Federal Police. This has been going on since August 1988. It went on through all of 1989. It went on through all of 1990. Naturally enough, the same gentleman has written to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), drawing his attention to the case, but at the moment the reply from the Department and from the Minister is that investigations are being undertaken and he will be advised in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what further investigations really need to be taken. Unfortunately it does not appear that these investigations involve Mr Landicho himself being interviewed by officers of the Department or being interviewed by officers of the Federal Police. Apparently they do not involve the interviewing of the woman in question. So it is very galling when there is an apparently clear-cut case of an abuse of the migration processes in this country-and when day after day people are not able to get loved ones into the country due to the quota system and employers find it difficult to get skilled employees into the country due to the requirements of the Migration Act-that the Federal Police and, more importantly, I suppose, the Federal Department of Immigration, failed to take any action. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landicho approached me on this matter. He has moved into my electorate and I have now written to the Minister outlining the circumstances of the case. Yesterday I placed on the Notice Paper of this place questions to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), eliciting information about the state of the investigations by the Department of Immigration and also by the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope by making this speech today and by placing those questions on notice that there will be some strong and positive action taken to investigate this case. I am not trying to prejudge it. Mr Landicho obviously has a particular point of view and he will be putting that strongly and there certainly should be a fair inquiry into the matter. But on the facts as they appear, at least prima facie, it would seem that this is a very clear-cut case. It is, as I say, extremely annoying that no action has been taken on it when literally hundreds of thousands of people are trying to gain access to this country and cannot do so, at least in one very small part because this woman has taken one place of the quota of immigrants into Australia. Surely if it is brought to the attention of the Department that an abuse has occurred, it would be hoped that the Department would take action upon it. </PARA>

Do they want us to send someone down there to hold their hand while the pen moves over the form?'', the angry spokesman for the Minister said'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Early last year, and again recently, I attended meetings in Toowoomba of the University of the Third Age, or U3A as it is more widely known. Let me say to those who know nothing of U3A that it is not just another body of learning. On the contrary, it is a radically exciting concept which involves an increasingly important and growing segment of our population-of course, I speak of the ageing, many in their 60s and 70s, many who have much to offer each other and the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first U3A campus began classes in Melbourne in 1985 under the sponsorship of the Australian Council on the Ageing and Monash University. By late last year approximately 70 independent U3A campuses were operating, in every State and Territory. Self-supporting U3A groups in southern Queensland are growing quickly with, for example, over 1,000 enrolled in the Sunshine Coast and 400 in Toowoomba. In the latter, I congratulate the Secretary, John Hart, and his busy executive for their dedication and effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I question the practice in this House of private members' motions not being put to the vote. Although this House is little more than a rubber stamp for the Executive, the priority given to private members' business on Thursdays at least pays lip service to democratic principles. While there has been a substantial extension of time for private members' business since 1988, it is little more than head-patting while no votes are taken. The fact that the majority of members are prepared to accept this humiliation and that it goes largely unremarked by the Press Gallery is a condemnation of our political system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From 1981 to 1988 some 43 per cent of private members' motions were brought to a vote. A form of Executive martial law was imposed following the successful motion of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in 1988 reinforcing the position of the House vis-a-vis the Senate. But now the Senate has the freedom to pass unanimously today's motion on Tibet, while we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> With the introduction of proportional voting and the increasing propensity of Australians to vote against the major parties, the Senate is becoming the people's House, while this place is becoming the parties' House. If the parties continue to prevent voting on private members' business, the Thursday morning sessions will become nothing more than the `Kiddies Korner' of Parliament. </PARA>

In New South Wales, 17,000 students in some 70 schools were supposed to have had these funds allocated at the beginning of the school term. For some obvious-perhaps electoral-reason that funding has still not been allocated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow is International Women's Day, but there will be little cause for celebration this year for women, particularly rural women. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is due to make a statement on the economy next week, but will he address the plight of rural women? I do not think he even appreciates the contribution that Australian rural women make to the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986 the contribution of women was estimated to be $8 billion. Almost one-third of all small businesses in Australia are owned and run by women and a significant percentage of those are in country towns. These women are to be highly commended for attaining this achievement because rural women, in particular, are discriminated against in their lack of access to education, training and social support. </PARA>
<PARA> In the depressing economic conditions that exist in rural Australia today, day-to-day living has been made even more difficult for rural women. Many of them are becoming isolated because they now have to assume the responsibilities of running the family farm as well as the family, as their husbands have been forced to find off-farm employment. Many others are faced with the prospect of having to travel long distances to find employment to supplement family income. There is very limited access to counselling and little support for victims of domestic violence, which research shows is increasing. Of the 37 poorest electorates in Australia, 33 are in rural Australia. I call on the Prime Minister to address the needs of these people and especially the needs of women when he makes his economic statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition, earlier this week I wrote to President Bush advising him of these grave concerns in this important area and advising him of course of the visit of the bipartisan delegation. I told the President:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia's great fear is that this subsidy war will continue to escalate. By contrast, I said that what must happen is that there be the deescalation and ultimate elimination of subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as all of us on both sides of the House have said with regard to this matter, there must be balance in our criticism. The United States programs of course cause us very real damage-there is no doubt about that whatsoever and noone seeks to hide it; in fact, we seek to deal with it. But, as I also said to the President in my letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia recognises that the original instigator of this subsidy war in agricultural trade is the European Community and Australia will continue to put its views firmly and clearly to the European Community at every opportunity. But the United States response to these policies through the mechanism of the EEP is causing hardship to us-a competitive non-subsidising agricultural exporter caught in the cross-fire.</PARA>
<PARA> I have previously stated that we will send a bipartisan delegation to Europe at an appropriate time. The timing of that visit will depend crucially on the advice from our mediators in Geneva and from our missions in Europe. With the European Community currently reviewing the common agricultural policy, this could be as long as a couple of months away if that is the appropriate advice received. But during that period we will not relax our pressures on the Europeans. The Cairns Group countries, led by Australia, will continue to play a major role in this respect and with the restart of the talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round the European Community will need to look at very substantial reform. That, finally, is the only way in which we will secure what we all, on both sides of the House, want-which is a substantive outcome on agriculture and a satisfactory outcome for the round as a whole.</PARA>

Having as a nation the occupancy of an island continent, we have to do our part to keep the international heritage together. We have done that with might and main, and will continue to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reasons for Australia's indebtedness are productive weaknesses and inadequate savings in the past. It is as simple as that. What action has the Government taken to deal with it? The answer is lower real unit labour costs, lift the profit share, lift investment, improve the micro side of the economy, and now deal with inflation-cut back the public sector borrowing requirement and lift public savings. They are the measures which the Government has undertaken to deal with the debt at source.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I had a question from the honourable member for Bennelong two days ago about the net income deficit. The net income deficit comes from Australia's net external liabilities. I have asked the Treasury to prepare a chart on Australia's net external liabilities, and it shows that Australia's net external liabilities stood at 29 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) when the Government came to office in 1983, and have risen to just under 46 per cent of GDP at the moment. That is, two-thirds of Australia's net external liabilities existed when this Government arrived in office. I table that chart.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me deal also with the debt to GDP question, which is another concept, which does not encompass net external liabilities-but just simply debt. In June 1980 net debt stood at 5.6 per cent of GDP, but this figure hid the true nature of Australia's awful structural weaknesses emerging. In 1981-82 Australia already had a current account deficit of 5.8 per cent of GDP, and of course it is the current account deficit which relentlessly drives our debt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the House has now had time to witness the change that occurs at the retail level of interest rates from changes in official monetary policy. That is, as the Reserve Bank of Australia lowers cash rates, call rates and overnight rates and those prices drift into bill rates, we then see deposit rates in banks come down. But because banks often have 90-day deposits it takes a while for those deposits to pass through. The result is that it takes a while for the cost of deposits to migrate down. When the cost migrates down, the banks are in a position to lower interest rates on loans. There are delays, therefore, which come from the application of official policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last reductions in official policy have led to reductions in prime lending rates, and we have seen earlier reductions lead to reductions in housing lending rates. What is in store for borrowers now is a further reduction in housing lending rates coming from earlier easings of official policy. That is what I said at a press conference a day or so ago, which was reported today. I believe that there is some possibility now of banks being able to provide that kind of relief.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether there is the capacity for further official reductions in rates will depend on how the economy is going. If the Government believes that, given the nature and state of the economy, lower interest rates would be possible with continuing deflation and a maintenance of lower levels of inflation-that is, an interest rate structure consistent with a lower level of inflation-it would make it easier for the Government to agree to a further reduction in official rates. But that position is not one which we think we have arrived at now. As information and data come through, we make judgments from time to time. We will keep on making those judgments. At the moment we cannot see it.</PARA>

But that terms of trade spike which we had in 1987-88 and which gave us the boom of 1988-89 was also around in the early 1970s.

It only underlines the total illiteracy of the honourable member for Flinders about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current account is a structural condition; it is a structural weakness which is shown on both production and savings. In relation to production, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should look at any Budget Statement (No. 2) of the last few years and any graph on investment in the 1970s. If he does, he will find a huge hole. The whole postwar trade in goods and services passed the Australian Liberal and National parties by. It went right past them, straight over their shoulders. That is, the trade which picked up Germany and Japan-with added value, research and development, and innovation-passed them by because they believed all they had to do was ship a bit more wheat and wool, find another mound of minerals and hand out tariff protection to their mates in Sydney and Melbourne. That was their policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Jack McEwen was the tariff hander-outer who was handing out tariffs on the one hand and kicking the farm sector on the other. That was the policy those opposite employed.

By the late 1960s, when it should have become apparent to them that the terms of trade were moving against us strongly-that is, when the high postwar prices for agricultural commodities were being replaced by high prices for manufactured goods-one would have thought the penny would have dropped and those opposite would have said, `Look, we will get into the manufacturing business because soon we will not be able to afford our imports'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a recent case in the honourable member's electorate-he has drawn my attention to it-where interference was caused by a new metal-clad building which was deflecting a television signal away from nearby residential areas. After an investigation, the Commonwealth Ombudsman concluded that the Department's power to correct interference did not extend to passive causes of interference-buildings which offer that type of interference. There has been another case recently in the Northern Territory where something similar occurred. The Northern Territory Government agreed to fund translators on top of a new building which was causing widespread interference to television services in Darwin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the more general problem we have in these particular instances is that we as a Federal government have no control over building codes and standards. It is quite evident from our experience in recent times that some of the developments taking place will create difficulties for television viewers and radio listeners. We are very happy to provide for local authorities and State governments information on technical standards which will assist them in the development of their own building plans if, as they should be, they are concerned about the reception of television services to their constituents and ratepayers.</PARA>
<PARA> So I do intend writing to various State Ministers for planning and local government as a result of the concerns raised by the honourable gentleman and others, pointing out to them the potential problems which they confront and inviting them to meet the problems that our transmitters are experiencing in their own plans for building construction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He still has time to go; he will whip up a crowd. While the Government does not plan any specific action regarding this meeting, we are aware of the difficulties being experienced in the bush and specifically in the Hamilton area. Quite seriously, last month I announced the appointment of a rural counsellor for that region. The person appointed to this position will work with farmers in the area, helping them to improve their financial arrangements and ensuring that they benefit from any entitlements under the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Hamilton meeting is partly designed to express dissatisfaction with the Opposition regarding the rural sector. As honourable members are aware, the Opposition has lots of ideas on the rural sector-ideas, not policies. The honourable member mentions wheat, and this is a case in point. The shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray, has endorsed the wheat industry's claim for price underwriting for the coming season, and he refers in a press release dated 1 March to the coalition's policy of underwriting on a single-year basis. That is perhaps what one would expect from the unreconstructed National Party of Australia, and perhaps it is what the former coalition Prime Minister would expect from that side.</PARA>
<PARA> But three days later the Leader of the Opposition says:</PARA>
<PARA>We have not put a position on the grain industry yet, although I have expressed a disposition-not an idea, a disposition-</PARA>
<PARA>against trying to help a very efficient industry by giving them a dose of inefficiency . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Just to give honourable members the full spectrum, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate-one of the dreaded Boswellians-was quoted in the Sunraysia Daily last week as saying that deregulation does not work. Here again the Opposition does not know what idea it believes in. This is the case in the rural sector as a whole and across the full range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast the Government's policies are consistent with clearly enunciated principles. When I take a submission to Cabinet next week on the wheat industry's problems and claims, those same principles will be the key to our deliberations. This Government is committed to an efficient, outward looking agricultural sector. In the face of difficult times these principles are even more essential. This is the reason why the Government is earning the respect of country people and why the Opposition has lost its way in the bush.</PARA>

<PARA>Does he know that the real rate of return on equity investment in Australia over the period in question was a paltry 2 per cent, compared with 40 in Japan, 13 in Germany, 11 in Britain and 8 in the United States? Is it not a fact that the Government's policies have totally failed?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply I said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the beginning, there may be issues in the survey which distort the finding on Australia, as there often are-</PARA>
<PARA>to which we had guffaws from the Opposition. I asked the Treasury to have a look at this issue, and it has had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The returns reported in the article are in $US terms. The relative returns on investments in Australia are adversely affected by the fact that the $A depreciated against the $US over 30 per cent in the 10 years to 1990. A large part of this decline reflected the deterioration in our terms of trade arising from external factors over which government policies can exert little if any influence.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The starting point factor is particularly pertinent in relation to the return on Australian equities. In the first two years of the survey period, i.e. 1981 and 1982, the return on Australian equities measured in $US fell in total by 50 per cent, whereas in the subsequent eight years from 1983 to 1990 the return increased by a total of about 30 per cent. The overall relatively poor performance by investment in Australia over the last 10 years is thus dominated by the collapse in investment returns that occurred in the first two years of the decade.</PARA>

We are very, very lucky indeed because, if we had proceeded with that close spaced parallel runway at an expense not dissimilar to what it will cost us to construct a medium spaced parallel runway when the go-ahead for that is given, we would have achieved virtually no improvement in traffic movement at Sydney University-I mean, Sydney Airport.

At the end of the day it would have laboured mightily with the taxpayer's dollar to produce a mouse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of assertions that have been made in recent months regarding consultations with the Cocos community, and specifically representations that were made to Senator Tambling. The Government does not accept those assertions. Following those assertions late last year, I took the opportunity once again to visit the Cocos Islands in January of this year. During that visit I discussed with the Islands' elected leaders and with a broad representative section of the residents some of the concerns raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Government would not argue that all Cocos residents would clearly understand every minute detail of the packages of changes that have been agreed to by the Islands' leaders, it is clear to me that the community as a whole has a very acceptable understanding of what is involved with the memorandum of understanding.</PARA>
<PARA> The community's elected representatives certainly left no doubt in my mind in mid-January that they were very anxious indeed to sign the memorandum of understanding as soon as possible. In fact, they have now come to Canberra for this purpose. Haji Wahin, the Chairman of the Cocos Council, in company with Chairman Parson of the Cocos Cooperative, who are with us today in the gallery, took the opportunity to sign that document this morning in the company of the Prime Minister. It is a very significant document indeed. I take this opportunity to table the document for the information of honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA> The MOU sets out the steps to be taken by the parties-the Commonwealth, the Cocos Council and the community's business arm, which is the cooperative society-to complete the process for introducing mainland standards of living for the territory's residents.</PARA>
<PARA> The level of support for the changes within the community can be gauged by the fact that both the Cocos Council and the cooperative society, which are both fully elected bodies, began from last year to phase in many of the changes for which they are responsible under the MOU. Achievement of mainland standards will fulfil the commitment that has been made by this Government at the time that the community voted for integration with Australia under a United Nations supervised act of self-determination in 1984. I think all members of this House and the community of Australia should be very pleased that that process has been completed within eight years.</PARA>

In his article, Mr Morley entered the debate initiated originally by the Sunday Sun newspaper about convicted parliamentarians being able to keep their entitlements as ex-members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Morley expanded the debate to include all retired MPs and in doing so set out a number of cases which he claimed demonstrated why retired members should not be allowed travel rights. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Another person who quit Queensland politics for the federal scene-where entitlements are even more liberal than here-drew tickets valued at $1928. </PARA>
<PARA>As I am the only person in some 40 to 50 years who quit Queensland politics for the Federal scene, this allegation obviously refers to me. However, there was no doubt about that. On the following Monday morning during the Brisbane Magazine program on radio 4BH, an interviewer, John Miller, named me. I should point out that during that morning, prior to the program, Mr Miller apparently ran radio pointers or promos to the effect that he was going to expose a former leader of the State Opposition who had used travel entitlements even though he was now a Federal member of parliament. I quote from that radio interview which Mr Miller had with the Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>MILLER: Indeed, Peter Morley's article, Mr Goss, on Saturday in the Courier-Mail made mention of the fact that some of these perks are used in, well, passing strange ways. He mentioned the case of one former, well in fact former Labor Opposition Leader in Queensland and now a Federal MP. He didn't name names, I will-Keith Wright-who apparently last year used his travel entitlement from the Queensland Parliament for a trip for him and his wife to Sydney and back, I think it was. Now, I'd be very silly from a legal point of view to suggest there was anything improper here but do you think that is really fair? He's on the public payroll in Canberra and yet he can use this perk?</PARA>
<PARA>Being told of this interview the next day by a concerned citizen, I endeavoured to contact Mr Miller--</PARA>

I have tried on no fewer than six occasions to take up this issue with the 4BH manager, Mr Merv Stafford, but obviously his busy schedule has prevented him from returning my calls. I did, however, get the opportunity to discuss the Courier-Mail article with the paper's editor, Mr Greg Chamberlain, and subsequently with Mr Peter Morley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our first telephone conversation, Mr Chamberlain said that he stood by Mr Morley totally because he had seen the article before it went to press and he knew that Mr Morley would not make up such a claim without the facts. It was at Mr Chamberlain's urging that I spoke finally with Mr Morley, who said that he stood by his allegations and had documents from the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation (QTCC) to back up his claim that I had personally used $1,928 for air travel.

I asked him to forward them to me and he refused to do so. That concerned me so, with the help of the Queensland Speaker, Jim Fouras, I finally got hold of those documents. I will be seeking leave to table them because they show clearly that, whilst $1,928 was used and that I am an ex-MLA of the Queensland Parliament, that money was not used by me and in fact it was a spouse entitlement. There is no way that Mr Morley, with all of his competency and integrity, could possibly have thought that it was used by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, Mr Speaker, the other documents that were presented to Mr Morley demonstrate clearly that the funds were used by my wife. I suggest that this is an issue that affects every one of us because other members and ex-members of Parliament-both National and Liberal-in the State of Queensland have also been accused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On election night I shared a television studio with the previous Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson. In the course of that evening I described him as the most dangerous person in Australia. The reason I called him that was because he personified the extraordinary approach to decision making which was adopted by the Hawke Government in the pre-election period when it paid absolutely no regard to the national interest but instead set out to curry favour with environmental groups in the hope that it would gather additional votes. It was that very tight focus on the party rather than the national interest which I believed to be an extremely dangerous thing for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are in this Parliament in the week leading up to the Government's industry statement. That statement is being brought forward, with a great deal of public interest, because of the state Australia is in. I often sit here in the House of Representatives and listen to the answers to questions. I hear the Treasurer (Mr Keating), for example, talk about Australia as though it had the economy of Germany. He talks about Australia as though it had the economy of Japan. He talks about an Australia in which he seems to be blissfully ignorant of the reality which is facing the Australian people. I would have thought that all of the honourable members in this House-like all of the people who are visiting this chamber today-would know that Australia in 1991 is a country in which many Australians are losing their jobs; many Australians are seeing a lifetime of building up a business disappear; many Australians are losing their homes; many Australians are losing their self-respect; and many Australians are losing hope. I think that any debate which takes place in this chamber which does not acknowledge the awful realities that are the stuff of the daily lives of our constituents is a debate being carried on by either knaves or fools. </PARA>
<PARA> Everywhere I go in Australia there is absolute outrage at the state of this country; there is absolute outrage at the failure of the Government to respond to the concerns of the people, and there is absolute outrage that a country which should be the richest, the most progressive and successful country in the world is regarded as a joke outside this country and internally is offering misery to far too many people. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the background of the concerns of the Opposition, about what the now Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean)-who was then a strong supporter of the Government as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-described as the failure of the Government to bring together its environment and industry policies. There is absolutely no excuse for the disgustingly political approach that has been adopted by this Government to this vital issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with the rest of Australia, this Government has the clearest possible handbook about the future. On an international level the Brooklyn Commission in Our Common Future-and this edition has a foreword by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke-sets out what the future has to be, a future in which if we are to ease starvation, a future in which if we are to solve our country's economic problem, we do not have to have environmental concern which means paralysis; we have to have something which Brooklyn describes as sustainable development. We have to have some principle applied in an area where lack of principle under the Hawke Government has been the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not some peculiar Tory quirk to believe that the environment has to be considered in the context of development. I sit here and watch the man described as a boofhead by Laurie Oakes-the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-coming in here and saying, `You are all Tories over there-you are a bunch of Tories'. Of course, he is covering up his own manifest inadequacies. Let him label as Tories the Commission for the Future. The Commission for the Future has addressed this issue. In a paper by Lyuba Zarsky, which I have quoted before and will quote again, one gets the clearest possible statement that if we want ecologically sustainable development in this country, we have some major hurdles. The hurdles that she identifies are, first and foremost, the restructuring of the domestic economy to restore balance in external payments; to first stabilise and then reduce our foreign debt. We must get better at producing and marketing high value products and services, both overseas and at home. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the best ally of environmental degradation is poverty, and perhaps the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), will take the time to tell us today how a rural industry which has been crushed by her Government with its lack of control of costs, how a farming community which is going broke and going out backwards, is going to deal with the foremost environmental issue in this country-soil degradation-when the National Farmers Federation has produced material which shows the clearest possible correlation between farmers' incomes and their capacity to spend money on preserving the land. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no logic, there is no substance in this Government's approach. There is a disgusting pursuit of sectional votes without regard to the national interest. This Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, is the proud inheritor of that tradition, and she has the enormous challenge of trying to reverse it. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who see this as some quirk of the Tories, some quirk of the Liberals, some quirk of the Nationals, let me quote what one of the Ministers of this Government, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), had to say, because it says a good deal about what underlies our own approach to this matter. The Minister, on 3 May, addressed a mining audience. There is a certain difference. The messages from this Government vary so much. Are they talking to a green audience or are they talking to a mining audience? The Prime Minister at the Australian Mining Industry Council shuffles and apologises for the Coronation Hill decision. He preens and puffs himself before the environmentalists. He is a disgusting person when he does that because again he ignores the national interest; he sacrifices Australia in the interests of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). </PARA>
<PARA> When speaking about those who maintain that environmental protection and economic development are fundamentally contradictory and who call for negative economic growth as the only path to ecological survival the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is acceptable if you happen to be fabulously wealthy, landed and indifferent to the fate and future of those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not acceptable if you happen to be a subsistence peasant in the Third World, a bonded labourer without access to clean drinking water or fuel, wood or proper housing or health care or clothing, or an unemployed factory hand in the suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a lot of unemployed factory hands in the suburbs of Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide and in the rural sectors of this country. They are unemployed in part because of the episodic, political decision making of this Government. We saw it with respect to the uranium industry-it all predates Senator Richardson-when the Labor Party did not join with those people of principle who oppose uranium mining for peaceful reasons or for any purpose. We know that the Labor Party is not like that: it said that we could have a great big uranium mine in South Australia because that was necessary for the survival of the Bannon Government. Yes, we can have a Labor uranium mine and sell our uranium there, but forget a uranium mine that is sold off as part of a factional deal within the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> Think of the jobs and the export income which have been destroyed. My colleague the leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out to me just yesterday that Canada, which has just one third of the low cost uranium reserves of Australia, earns three times as much-$1.2 billion as against $0.4 billion. That is income lost to hard-pressed Australia and lost because of the opportunism and politicisation of this issue by the Labor Party. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and all other Ministers were a party to the decisions on Coronation Hill and forests which everybody knows bear little relation to the decisions which are now being taken by the Government. If one wants a demonstration of the lack of bona fides of the Labor Party and its preparedness to sacrifice the jobs and futures of Australians, one just has to look at the twisting and turning to the music of the electoral cycle, because that is what this whole debate has been reduced to in Australia under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The job of the Minister at the table is quite simple: it is to manipulate the Green vote to the best possible Labor Party advantage. Is there anyone in this chamber, the community, industry or labour who genuinely believes that the Australian Labor Party Government under the Prime Minister, Robert James Lee Hawke, has honestly, sincerely, decently and in the national interest taken decisions on the environment? It has not. It has taken those decisions with one eye to the electoral cycle and that has been the eye that it has left open. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have a potential strike of capital. We have the clearest possible indications by the timber and mining industries that, because they cannot trust this Government, they will not be able to invest. That has been stated in the clearest possible terms by these industries. It is not that they want to withdraw their capital and send it overseas-which is what is happening-but because there is no basis for investment in this country. That is the tragedy that this Government has brought upon us and that is the challenge which it now has to meet. Can it reverse that total lack of trust which means that Australian firms would rather invest in Indonesia and anywhere in Asia, North America or Europe than invest in this country and provide jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a crisis in confidence in this Government which is now desperately casting about trying to find a way to meet it. Government members have met five times this week and now they are going to come forward with resource security legislation. The complexity of that legislation will be very interesting to watch. Just look at the submission of the timber industry, an industry which in its submission clearly acknowledges the need to look after environmental concerns, to have assessment by the Australian Heritage Commission, to ensure that the allocations of timber take into account the preservation of essential environmental values, to have a safety margin, to protect areas within forestry areas against encroachment and to have a margin for error and an ability to correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see how the Government goes about reducing all of those essential environmental requirements into a single Act and how it goes about guaranteeing that it will behave in a trustworthy way. It is going to be a fascinating legislative exercise. From talking to industry people, I can tell the Minister that none of them genuinely believes that there is any way of forcing this Government to act with integrity. Their experience since 1983 is that this Government is totally without integrity in the face of an election, and there is absolutely no principle to be gained. Let us see what principle it can establish in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this Government has been activated by the political principles of the New South Wales Right. It has brought to this whole area of decision making government in the party interest and an ignoring of the public interest. It is the brother of the ex-New South Wales Government, of Victoria Inc. and of WA Inc. After years of behaving in an untrustworthy way, after years of betrayal of Australia, I do not believe that there is any opportunity for it to recover its ground. There is no legislative guarantee that will deliver integrity of decision making, yet that is the task the Government has set itself with this resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that the Opposition believes that resource security is absolutely essential if we are to have investment in our vital interests. The Opposition will stand by all its environmental commitments, but those commitments will be clear and unequivocal and, once met, will not be followed by politically opportunistic interference. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that the Australians who are out of work and losing their homes and the country which is being plunged into debt require a totally different standard of government and administration in this vital area than has been shown by the Government. We regard the Government with particular contempt for its administration of the environment where it touches upon development, and we call upon the Government to don new clothes in this fundamental area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to discuss at long last in this House some issues that relate to the environment. Very few opportunities to discuss the environment come from the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). In his time as shadow Minister for the environment, we have had very little indication of what his views or the Opposition's views are on any of the major environment issues, with the exception of the greenhouse issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his usual patronising, preaching style the honourable member for Pearce said last year that the challenge facing politicians was to be less opportunistic, less interested in getting headlines and more solution orientated. I ask him to take heed of his own message. We saw no indication of that in his speech today. The only person trying to exploit environmental issues politically is in fact the honourable member for Pearce. Opposition members all know that, just as members of the Government know it. The problem is that he has demonstrated no substance at all in this portfolio. He has made no attempt to come to grips with these very complex issues. </PARA>
<PARA> He knows as well as I do that it is very difficult to get the right balance in environmental issues, to truly integrate the environment into the economy. But what is he doing to contribute to that debate? He asked four questions last year and one question successfully this year. All those questions have been about development; none of them has been about how we can actually integrate the environment into the economy. He stands up here and throws around the Brundtland report, Our Common Future. He says, `That's it. That is the solution to the problems'. But it is not as simple as that. That is not the solution. How do we work those things through?</PARA>
<PARA> What contribution is he making to the ecologically sustainable development (ESD) debate? He has put out about three press releases since he has been shadow Minister. Again, they have not addressed those fundamental issues. How do we come to terms with addressing that balance between the environment and the economy? That is what this Government is going through with the ESD process. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not embarrassed in the least by the fact that our Cabinet has spent several hours discussing this complex issue of resource security. If it took several weeks, I would not be embarrassed about it at all. It shows that this Government is genuine in its environmental concerns; it is genuine also in its attempt to support industry. It is important that we get the balance right, and that is what we have been trying to do on this very complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time any government has seriously tried to integrate the economy and the environment. People would think that we would get some sort of bipartisan support on some of these issues. But we do not; we get an incredibly superficial contribution, with all the questions coming from people who say, `Why are you not supporting development?' I would understand that if it came from the National Party colleagues of the honourable member for Pearce. They are people who have never had any sympathy or support for environment issues. However, Opposition questions about the environment come consistently from the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce-that is, when he actually stands up and says anything on the environment . </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mind his criticism on these issues, providing he makes some contribution to the debate. The only way he has been able to gain any attention at all for himself in this Parliament is to behave like a naughty boy and get sent out. This issue is much more important than superficial, trite comments, and we are the party which has to address it. We are addressing it through the process we have set in place. I am not ashamed of the fact that we have had to sit there and try to analyse the issues and get the balance right. I frankly believe we have done that. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of debate that we have had in the last few days in our Party and in our Government is the sort of debate those opposite never have. The honourable member for Pearce cannot even get support from his own colleagues. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is at the table at the moment. Last year he said that we should do the development first and then solve the problems. That is the Opposition's answer to integrating the environment into the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we heard the fine speech of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He implied that it was against the long term national interest to consider these issues. I submit to this House that it is in the long term national interest to have these discussions to try to get that integration of the economy and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> They are just the views of Party of the honourable member for Pearce. But how can the members of the Liberal Party try to get a sensible debate on these issues when they have their National Party colleagues? They are the axemen of the Parliament. They have a view that if it moves you shoot it, if it stands you chop it down and if it is under the ground you dig it up. That is the sort of simplistic way that those opposite have run public policy on the environment over the years. While they were in government the environment was not even an issue that was considered. We are serious about addressing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that there are not problems associated with duplication of responsibilities, say, between State governments and the Commonwealth Government or that there are not better ways we can streamline environmental processes. I am already addressing all of those issues. As a result of the initiative by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the Premiers Conference, already we have established an intergovernmental committee on the environment where we are looking at the different roles of State and local government. As a result of that, we are going to establish a national environmental protection agency which will look at national standards as they relate to the environment and I think that will be welcomed by the business community. But we will not be running away from our responsibility to the environment. We will be trying to streamline the processes so they are simpler, clearer, uniform and consistent. They are very important principles that I think we need to get right. They are an essential part of the way we get the balance between the environment and the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ESD process is also trying to address these essential issues. A lot of resources of the Federal government, the private sector and the State governments are going into this. But what contribution are we getting from those opposite? Nothing. All they do is yap and ask why we are not having more development-more development now, not yesterday. As I said, we are not anti-development, but we are about addressing these very serious issues. I think the people of this country understand that the only party that will ever even attempt to get that balance right is the Labor Party-its members and its representatives in this House. </PARA>

<PARA> Over the last year, we have not only set this ESD process in place but we have also worked with State governments and, at times, with industry and the broader community to develop our environment policy. As I said, one important area where I would very much appreciate some support from the Opposition is in the establishment of a national environmental protection agency. That is an issue on which we have got to sit down and negotiate with State governments. I have started doing that with my State colleagues. But what sort of contribution have we had from the Opposition in relation to that? Does the Opposition agree or not with it? Who knows what the Opposition thinks about anything?</PARA>
<PARA> Another issue is that in 1992 a world conference will discuss biodiversity. We are working through national policies on biodiversity. It is an incredibly important issue, particularly for the National Party. But what does it know about it? It never discusses it. What does the Opposition see as our national biodiversity policy? Again, the Opposition does not even know how to pronounce it, let alone what it actually means by it. It is all a question of not just platitudes but getting down to the serious issue of how it will all work in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of greenhouse gas emissions is one area where the Opposition did make a contribution-and I thank the Opposition very much for that. I acknowledged that contribution at the time. But again this complex issue has to be addressed at all levels of the community. It is an issue where I would appreciate the Opposition's contribution on how we reach those targets. Again, there has been no contribution from the Opposition at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of this exercise today is to try to score cheap political points instead of trying to address these very serious issues. Over the last year since I have been the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories I think we have seen some substantial improvements in enhancing our environment record. As Australia's environment Minister, I am very proud when we go to these international forums and take our place as a world leader on the environment. We can do that; we did that last week; and we can continue to hold our head up proudly. We will continue to take that very high profile not just on international issues like biodiversity conventions and greenhouse gas issues but also here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that we demonstrate here in Australia that we are prepared to get that balance right. As I said, that does not mean avoiding industry or running away from development. I and my Government have always supported development, but we will not throw away our concern and commitment to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, of course, we have also extended World Heritage. That is a classic case where we got no support from a National Party government in Queensland. World Heritage was introduced and accepted in Queensland only after continual struggles with the National Party Government. We got no support whatsoever. But we now have, in cooperation with the Queensland Labor Government, a World Heritage and management structure there which will ensure the protection of that area forever. I am very proud that our Government has done that, and we will continue to protect that area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last six months we have nominated as a World Heritage area Shark Bay. Again, we sat down and discussed the matter with the State Government and came up with a management plan for the fisheries industry. I admit that we have not made everybody happy, but I think we have got the balance right by preserving an area that has World Heritage values and ensuring that the fishing industry will be managed properly and that tourism will not over-exploit that area. Again, that is getting that balance right. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar debate occurred in the House yesterday on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That is another classic case of where I am incredibly proud of the position we have taken on the protection of that area. We will continue that position in cooperation with the Queensland Government. That is a fantastic example of ecologically sustainable development. It is a living, breathing example of an area of World Heritage significance, cherished by all Australians, yet the area is open for tourism-it is one of the great tourist attractions in the world-and it supports a lively fishing industry. That is ecologically sustainable development working. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now conducting an information gathering exercise on Cape York to determine what will happen to that area. When the Opposition was in government it did very little with the environment. One of the reasons was because the same community awareness that exists today did not exist then. Today we have an enormous amount of information to gather so that we know what we are protecting, the reason we need to protect it and the areas in which protection is needed. That is an essential part of my portfolio covering the environment-as it is with the shadow Minister. The information is obtained, community consultation occurs and a balance is struck between the environment and the economy. That is exactly the exercise Cabinet has undertaken over the last few days and weeks on resource security. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a simple debate; it is a serious one, which warrants much more serious discussion-and this is a great shame-than we have seen in the Parliament. Last year the honourable member for Pearce said that it was easy to sound green, but I am afraid the honourable member cannot even do that. I am sorry that the debate on this issue has not been of sufficient depth. It has remained at a superficial level, and I believe the environment is too important to be kept at that level. This matter involves serious questions on the whole future of the survival of Australia and on getting the balance right. It is not about development at any cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of this very important debate on resource security, we should lay to rest a couple of remarks made by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She seemed to intimate that the Opposition had no interest in the environment and was somewhat incompetent. I should like to declare both an environmental and a commercial interest in the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the edification of the Minister, since 1978 I have been involved in a forestry project on the one hand and an agro-forestry project on the other, demonstrating that livestock and trees can be grown together, and also I have been involved in a commercial eucalypt plantation in an area where risk has a much greater chance than gain. On the same piece of land I have a wetlands project, which has been improving slowly since 1980, and my family is starting work on another this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with hundreds of thousands of others, ever since I heard about it-seven years ago-I have been a contributing member of a North American wetlands project, which spends upwards of $US50m each year creating breeding grounds for wildfowl. I am involved in getting a similar project going here. It might be worth the Minister's while knowing that I believe that the Canadians will tell her that the biggest private wetlands project in the world is taking place in my State at this very minute. I will bet that the Minister cannot tell us what that project is. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLACHLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister would not know. I thought I would mention these facts in case anybody thought that we on this side of the House take only the commercial view. We take both views. In all of these projects that I have been involved in, I have never seen hide nor hair of what we call a green; nor have I seen hide nor hair of a closet green from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, for all of that, like most others in Australia who can think, I believe that sensible commercial investment has been stultified by the overzealous urban conservation commandos who became a powerful instrument shaping the policies and practice of governments desperate for votes and desperate to remain in office. They weaned governments from the reality by cruelly defrauding city communities of the facts, and I have to say that I think this Government was very good at that. But of course the debate is changing. It is changing back towards a more balanced and sensible commercial and environmental view. </PARA>
<PARA> Just so that nobody will think I am a Johnny-come-lately to this subject, I would like to point out that a year ago I said in a conference on this sort of subject:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government . . . had sadly embraced the politics of cant and catastrophe peddled by the dark greens in a belated attempt to coerce voters . . . that they may succeed if responsible Australians didn't stand up. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of history. We did not stand up and we lost the election. The fact of the matter is that when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) came to office he said that he was very keen to solve the problems of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Six and a half years later on 7 December 1989, the principal outcome of the Prime Minister's conference on sustain- able development was an undertaking to prepare a discussion paper which it said `will attempt to define ecologically sustainable development'-6 1/2 years to define the substance of the argument. He and his colleagues-Senator Richardson in particular-exploited the politics of this and they won the votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, I would like to look at the billions of dollars that we know are not being invested in this country today. There is the $600m a year in revenue that we do not get from Kakadu in gold, platinum and palladium; it is just not happening. The Prime Minister said it should, and then changed his mind after it had passed all of the environmental tests. Then there is Wesley Vale: $1 billion, and perhaps $350m of export income that we will never know. In 1988, the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said that project should go ahead and was going to throw some dollars down the track of that investment; but the Government changed its mind. Amcor was compelled, in part by the uncertainty and complexity of this debate-and it has said so publicly-to direct its capital expenditure overseas; so far that has been $450m in North America, France and the United Kingdom. Forestry industries have warned that Australia could lose $2.7 billion in export income if this environmental veto matter is not solved. ICI Australia Ltd has closed several Melbourne plants for environmental reasons and other companies have done the same. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to do is to look around for the reasons why that has happened. I would like to quote from a document dated 21 February 1991 and signed John Kerin, Alan Griffiths, John Button and Simon Crean. That document, being a Labor Party document to the Caucus, bears the signatures of those four Ministers. On page 2, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a perception within industry, the trade union movement and the community that the Government has no clear process to handle forest disputes and guarantee that certain forests are available for value adding activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is that perception in the whole of Australia? It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Existing processes, including woodchip export licences and heritage and environment protection mechanisms, have proved to be grossly inadequate. These have resulted-</PARA>
<PARA>it says-</PARA>
<PARA>in forest use allocation decisions being challenged and frequently re-opened by both State and Commonwealth Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, on the Government's own admission in a paper to the Australian Labor Party Caucus, industry will no longer invest, and that is why we need some process for resource security. We turn over the page and we see that there needs to be some Commonwealth legislation. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the legislation would be to clearly define that within the ambit of Commonwealth powers, some identified areas of forest are available for multiple uses including wood production. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would state that the Commonwealth would not take any action for the purpose of preventing wood supply/harvesting for conservation or environmental reasons where this wood harvesting is in accordance with agreed management regimes and agreed management production zones . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have it. We now need legislation to solve the problem that the Government itself, on its own admission in its own paper to Caucus, has caused. There is no other proof necessary. Everybody knows that investment will not come back in this country until we solve our internal problems. People know that the problems need to be solved on the waterfront, in the air and at the workplace. We need to restore productivity and get it up. This resources security trauma is the epitome of our dilemma. Australia knows what has to happen. It knows about the diversions of the Green lobby of the last few years, and it knows that life and Australia have to be brought back to reality. Of course, reality itself has caused that. Our self-made recession and our dire economic circumstances have brought us to that reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government went along with the Green diversions. In fact, it used them for its own ends. It is hoist on it; long may it stay there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me ask the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan): what is the use of having a privately owned wetland if that more significant wetland in Kakadu National Park is to be ruined through mining? Good on him for bothering to have the wealth to have a property in which a wetland is situated and which he chooses to save. That is terrific. But the essence of that is that we have a World Heritage listed property at Kakadu that consists of natural wetlands that we chose to save and we used legislation to save them. It is quite obvious that mining or forestry-not in the wetland-can pose a real danger to these valuable resources. The matter of public importance we are debating states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Hawke Government's political exploitation of environmental issues which has caused a crisis of confidence in resource investment and threatens to undermine sustainable development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened to ecological sustainable development, which we all agree is the very essence of the debate? The honourable member has dropped off ecological sustainable development. Does he really suggest that those of us who are wealthy enough should buy up a little piece of wetland or forest or whatever and secure that to ourselves? It is obvious nonsense. There are real national and international heritages of world renown which require government action and support. </PARA>
<PARA> The last decent shadow Minister for the environment was Senator Chris Puplick and those opposite knocked him off. They have now put in his place the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who is patently a dud. On two occasions I have walked into this place expecting a complete half-hour debate from the honourable member for Pearce, but I arrive and he sits down. I do not suppose it is any coincidence. On at least two occasions when he has had half an hour to debate the substance of issues in this portfolio he has not bothered even to front the box. He has not walked into the place, or he has stood up for two or three minutes and sat down again. </PARA>
<PARA> What do you mean by resource security? What does it mean to you? What do you ask of a Government when you talk about resource security? I do not think you know what is required. Why do you think it has taken us five days of heady debate to get it right? Because it is a tough decision. That is why, Fred, and there is no way you can handle it. You cannot even make an ordinary statement in this House as a shadow Minister. There is no way you could get out there and tough it on a real debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what the honourable member regards as being important in resource security. In the Advocate, a Tasmanian paper, on Thursday 7 February 1991, there is an article headed, `Opposition backs Tas. pulp mill'. That article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chaney said he supported the concept of resource guarantee but believed any legislation should be a State, and not Federal, responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>That is your view, that is terrific; but it does not leave you a leg to stand on. It does not allow you to come here and ask us to put in place Federal legislation, because you do not want Federal legislation. You would not want the five days of debate that we have had. You do not want that because you are not quite sure, Fred, what the term means. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Pearce tried to define the national interest. Patently he left out concern for the environment as part of that national interest. The environment movement in this country has helped us to define the national interest. Ten years ago, foresters, miners, people in city streets and engineers who run electricity utilities around this country had no concept of what the environment and its preservation meant. Today, they do. Legislation for resource security is the next step in the path of defining the national interest. I wonder if honourable members opposite understand that that is the next step in defining the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not gut a definition of the national interest by taking or ignoring environmental issues; we define environmental issues into the national interest. No-one says that it is an easy process. It is patently an extremely difficult process and we have now just locked up the next step in that process. So a big tick to the environmental movement in this country for at least having dragged many of us kicking and screaming to a point where the environment is centre stage and will always remain a very important part of the national interest of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, the environment is the very essence of our capital and it is the way in which we manage that capital that will be the means by which we should be regarded as a government. There is no doubt whatsoever that in specific issues, such as Coronation Hill and Kakadu, more broadly, or in the wet tropical rainforests or in the rainforests of northern Tasmania, when it comes down to defining what is a resource that needs to be exploited and what is a resource that needs to be preserved, we will have massive conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that through our legislation we have never once denied the forest industry any resource. What has happened is that the industry is now exhausted by the debate, by the conflict between environmentalists and foresters over areas such as the south-east forests of New South Wales. It is exhausted from the debate. That is not because, through legislation, we have denied it the resource; it has simply spat the dummy, it has run out of legs. So it has said to the Government that it will not invest unless the Government gives it a cast-iron guarantee that we will not have any more fights. It is a substitution effect. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that the industry has ever been denied resources; it is that it has run out of puff. The fight has been debilitating; it has been debilitating for both sides. But I am glad that we in the Government have been able to resolve the issue so that, from now on, resource security will be an essential part of the process of the resolution of things that used to be battled out in the middle of the south-east forests. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a process in place, soon to be announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), whereby everyone will know the rules. There will be a security inasmuch as there will be an understanding of the rules of play. We readily admit that the rules of play have shifted enormously over the past five, six, seven or eight years. They have shifted as we have learned more about the environment, as foresters have learned more about the environment and as miners have learned more about the environment. Each of us has had to learn as we have moved through this debate, so the goals have shifted in that sense. We make no apology for that. </PARA>
<PARA> But as we have shifted our goals, we have learned; we have understood that we cannot have ongoing and open conflict between resource users and resource preservers. We have to provide a means whereby we can resolve those debates. We must not kid ourselves; this has been a very difficult issue for the Government because we have a Labor Government in Tasmania which will probably fall as a result of recent decisions made by this Cabinet. That proves that we have heart. We are prepared to make those decisions which may even lead to the demise of the Labor Government in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that proves that we have the ability to make the decisions. It is dead obvious. But never once has the honourable member for Pearce put his ideas onto paper or spoken into that microphone and let us know what he means by resource security. Never once has he let us see the colour of his ideas so that we could analyse them. He has never once assisted in the whole hot debate about resource security and the conflict between resource use and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now at a point in this debate where we have eight World Heritage listed areas in this country and there are two or three more on the way. We are now at the sharp end of managing World Heritage listed properties-there is no greater number in any other continent on earth. We have already proved that we are good at doing that; now comes the next step of resolving reasonably the resource conflicts that have rocked this nation, not for the last eight years but for the last 80 years. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, which provides for Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for the provision of higher education. The Bill provides increased funding for higher education institutions totalling some $171m over the 1991 to 1993 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements, the Bill provides for additional expenditure over the 1991 to 1993 triennium amounting to some $148m to take account of movements in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's higher education salary and non-salary indexes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for $4.7m to be transferred, in each year of the 1991 to 1993 triennium, from the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1988 to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The purpose of this transfer, agreed to between the Commonwealth and the Queensland State Government, is to enable higher education courses in Queensland which are currently located within the technical and further education sector to be transferred to the higher education sector and funded as higher education courses. This will provide a more appropriate location for the future development of these courses, and will bring course provision in Queensland into line with that in other States.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill takes account of altered arrangements for the special overseas postgraduate fund to enable expenditure under this program to be spread over the period 1991 to 1994. Originally, $4.3m was notionally allocated for expenditure in 1990-91. The reallocation of this money is designed to allow for a properly structured program and does not change the approved overall level of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the transfer to 1991 of $2.2m in unexpended funds from the 1990 higher education research program. In addition, the Bill takes account of revised amounts for reimbursement of higher education contribution scheme revenue to the States for State funded places. These revisions have been made on the basis of updated information obtained from the States on the number of such places eligible for reimbursement. Some $7m in additional expenditure will be provided for this purpose over the 1991 to 1993 triennium.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue fund. The Bill is consistent with the practice, adopted over many years, of introducing an annual Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue fund. </PARA>
<PARA> A Loan Bill is required this year because it now appears that the Consolidated Revenue fund will be in deficit although the Budget as a whole is still expected to remain in surplus. The situation of the Consolidated Revenue fund being in deficit while the Budget is in surplus arises because appropriations from the fund include various items that are classified as financing transactions rather than Budget outlays, so that they do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the national debt sinking fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the loan fund. The Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated by the Parliament, apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Bill be passed as soon as possible so that necessary borrowings authorised under the Bill to finance the deficit in the Consolidated Revenue fund can be accommodated within the Government's normal seasonal pattern of raisings. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991 proposes to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 to enable, amongst other things, collection of the superannuation supervisory levy which is proposed to be imposed by the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991. It should be read as one with that Bill. It is to come into operation on the day on which it receives royal assent. The Bill also proposes a number of other changes to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, to which I shall refer later. </PARA>
<PARA> Trustees of funds or trusts who lodge an annual return with the Commissioner would be liable to pay the levy when they lodge the return and it would be due and payable at the time of lodgment. It would not be a requirement for the levy, or the full amount of the levy, to be paid at the time of lodgment. However, where some levy remains unpaid, the Commissioner would have the option of either issuing or not issuing a notice concerning the satisfaction of the fund or trust conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner proposes to issue guidelines within which he would make certain decisions to refuse to issue a notice because of an unpaid levy. The Commissioner's decision would be a reviewable decision under the provisions of section 16 of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. This means that the decision could be reconsidered by the Commissioner, and if necessary the fund or trust could apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if it were to remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the review. </PARA>
<PARA> A late payment penalty may apply if any levy moneys were to remain unpaid after lodgment. This is consistent with provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act, imposing a penalty for the late payment of tax. The late payment penalty would be calculated on a monthly basis, at a rate of 20 per cent per annum of the levy which remains unpaid at the commencement of the relevant month, subject to a minimum monthly amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The late payment penalty would be calculated in the same way as the late lodgment component of the levy under the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill, and the use of whole calendar months would provide a smooth crossover from one to the other, where relevant. The provisions would simplify the calculations necessary to determine the total levy to be paid. It is envisaged that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission would produce a simple ready reckoner for this purpose, to which trustees would be able to refer. In addition, the arrangements outlined would facilitate the streamlining of annual return processing in the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The levy and late payment penalty would be payable to the Commissioner and would be able to be recovered as debts due to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new arrangements outlined above would encourage the timely payment of the correct levy amount. They would also provide flexibility by allowing the Commissioner to process returns and issue a notice of compliance in cases of small underpayments arising from simple and genuine error. The Commissioner would be able to remit the whole or a part of the late lodgment amount and the whole or a part of a late payment penalty. Guidelines would be issued by the Commissioner which would set out the criteria for the making of such decisions and, as with his decisions to refuse to issue notices of compliance because of unpaid levies, these decisions would be ultimately reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> For flexibility of administration, the Bill provides for the Commissioner to recover amounts of unpaid levy for a previous year from a current year's levy payment. This would enable the Commissioner to refuse to issue a notice of compliance to a fund relating to a current year if there were unpaid amounts arising from previous years and the total payment does not cover all amounts payable. The Commissioner would be able to make regulations providing for exemptions from the levy, remissions of levy, the manner of payment for the levy and other amounts payable under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act and for the refund, or other application, of overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first few years, until accurate asset profiles of funds and trusts are available, it will be difficult to accurately estimate the revenue which would be generated each year by a prescribed levy which is graduated according to asset size. Also, the precise amount of revenue that would be required to be raised in the first year of the levy, to fully recover relevant costs of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and based on the relevant current functions of the Commission, has yet to be confirmed. It is estimated, however, that the amount required to be raised by the basic levy in the first year or two would be of the order of $6m to $8m. These amounts are therefore estimated revenue targets. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue estimates do not include any estimate of revenue which might be generated by the late payment penalty. If the current flat $40 fee were continued, it is estimated that revenue would be of the order of $3.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the provisions relating to the collection of the superannuation supervisory levy, other provisions of the Bill provide that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) annual returns to the Commissioner by funds and trusts, and notices to the Commissioner required by the reasonable benefit limits provisions of sections 15F and 15G of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act may, with the Commissioner's approval and within the Commissioner's specifications, be able to be supplied on a data processing device such as a diskette;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a request by a person under section 15Q of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act for a copy of a previous reasonable benefit limit determination must be accompanied by a fee if such a fee is prescribed in the occupational superannuation standards regulations;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) where the Commissioner considers it is reasonable, he may exercise a discretion to accept a part payment of a fee as full payment where that fee relates to a return for a year prior to 1990-91 or to a return for that year which is lodged before the Bill receives royal assent. This is to overcome a flaw in the existing legislation which effectively requires the Commissioner to recover all underpayments, no matter how small. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also proposes amendments to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act to correct a technical oversight that occurred when the pooled superannuation trust provisions were inserted in 1989, and proposes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to make it clear that the late lodgment amount is not deductible from the taxable income of a fund or trust. </PARA>
<PARA> All the amendments to be achieved by this Bill would come into effect on the Bill receiving royal assent and, to the extent that they affect returns to be lodged by funds and trusts, would apply to returns lodged after the Bill receives royal assent which are for the year of income commencing on 1 July 1990 or a subsequent year of income. I commend the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 proposes the imposition of a supervisory levy on superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts which are subject to supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The levy would be due and payable upon lodgment of annual returns with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in accordance with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. The proposed levy would replace the present system of charging funds and trusts with a fixed fee-which is presently set at $40. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that the Government announced in its August 1990 Budget statement that the fee would be replaced with a new levy commencing with the annual returns for the 1990-91 year of income. The Government's intention in introducing this measure is to effect full cost recovery for the supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was established in 1987, the Government decided to recover the costs of superannuation supervision and a lodgment fee of a flat $30 was set. Costs recovered under that fee have only recovered approximately half of the costs of relevant superannuation functions because the number of funds lodging returns has been less than half what was expected from Taxation Office records. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1991, will give effect to the Government's Budget announcement. There are two Bills because the supervisory levy is a tax and, as such, must be imposed under a separate Bill. This Bill should be read as one with the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill and is to come into operation on the day the Occupational Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the superannuation supervisory levy to have two components, a basic levy amount and a late lodgment amount. The Bill provides for the basic levy amount to be prescribed by regulation. It is intended that the amount of basic levy payable would generally be determined on the basis of fund or trust asset size although, where appropriate, other bases for determining the levy may be used. Small funds-in particular those with assets of $0.5m or less-would pay a levy which approximates only the cost of actually processing the forms, as this closely approximates the call of those funds on Insurance and Superannuation Commission resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Large funds would pay a larger levy, generally depending on fund size, with a maximum levy applying at a level which would recoup all of the relevant costs. It is important to note that it would be possible to impose different scales of levy on different categories of funds or trusts. Thus, it would be possible, where appropriate, that superannuation funds might pay a different scale of levy compared with pooled superannuation trusts or approved deposit funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, being the Bill which imposes the levy, is required to set a statutory upper limit to the amount which it would be possible to impose on an individual fund or trust in any one year of income. The maximum levy limit set by the Bill is $30,000. This would amount to a very large increase over the current flat fee, although proportionately it is comparable to the payment of $40 in the case of a fund with $0.5m in assets. In practice, however, the amount of the maximum levy that will generally apply to funds and trusts in the first few years of operation will be well below this amount. I expect that the maximum levy imposed by regulation for the first year or so of operation would be of the order of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for a late lodgment amount to be added to the basic levy amount when a return is lodged after a grace period of 14 days following a lodgment date specified by the Commissioner. The proposed period of grace is intended to allow a reasonable time for correction of returns which were attempted to be lodged on or before the relevant date but which were not complete-for instance, in circumstances where a trustee has omitted to sign a return. </PARA>
<PARA> The late lodgment amount would be calculated on a monthly basis at a rate of 20 per cent per annum of the basic levy prescribed for the particular fund, subject to a minimum monthly amount. The late lodgment amount is not a penalty and is intended to encourage timely lodgment of returns and to recover the additional costs associated with processing returns which are lodged late. </PARA>
<PARA> The large majority of the funds that will lodge a return will pay the minimum basic levy. If in the first year of operation the minimum basic levy amount were $40, then the minimum monthly late lodgment amount would be $5. </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary discussions are currently under way between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and industry representatives concerning an appropriate progressive scale for the basic levy, which would apply to returns in respect of the 1990-91 year of income. There will be annual discussions with the industry when the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is determining the scale of levies. In addition, there will be annual consultations between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Department of Finance in determining the amount of revenue required to fully recover all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first few years, until accurate asset profiles of funds and trusts are available, it will be difficult to accurately estimate the revenue to be generated each year by a prescribed levy which is graduated according to asset size. Also, the precise amount of revenue that would be required to be raised in the first year of the levy, to fully recover relevant costs of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and based on the relevant current functions of the Commission, has yet to be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated, however, that the amount required to be raised by the basic levy in the first year or two would be in the order of $6m to $8m. These amounts are therefore estimated revenue targets. The revenue estimates do not include any estimate of revenue which might be generated by the late lodgment amount. If the current flat $40 fee were continued, it is estimated that revenue would be of the order of $3.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements I have just outlined, together with a provision for rounding up to the next whole dollar, would also simplify the calculations necessary to determine the total levy to be paid. It is envisaged that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will produce a simple ready reckoner for this purpose to which trustees will be able to refer. In addition, the arrangements outlined will facilitate the streamlining of annual return processing within the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I commend the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 2 of this Bill amends the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The need to amend the Act has been brought about by the Government's decision to extend the grants for industry research and development scheme (GIRD). This means that the Government's industry research and development support measures have now all been extended and are thereby complementary. These schemes have been under way since the mid-1980s and have contributed to a marked increase in our industry research and development. The predecessors of the present schemes operated for well over a decade. This continuing support demonstrates to the business community the Government's determination to encourage innovation in industry as a basis for enhanced competitiveness and strength. Planning for research and development is necessarily a longterm commitment and I am pleased that the Government is able to encourage this through its package of support schemes. GIRD grants will total approximately $32m per annum for the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA> The national procurement development program (NPDP) is a relatively new component of the package. The concept of research and development specifically directed towards the purchasing requirements of government agencies shows great promise. It has already been embraced by the States and Territories in a truly national scheme. For these reasons I am pleased to take this opportunity to bring the scheme into the Act, rather than continuing to operate under delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Government's continuing strong commitment to encouraging innovation in Australian industry, it is also critical that the utmost value is obtained from outlays in research and development support. To this end, the schemes are under constant scrutiny. Furthermore, the Government will require comprehensive reviews of the schemes before committing funds past June 1994 in the case of GIRD and June 1992 in the case of NPDP. The latter review is to be undertaken by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity to clarify some aspects of the legislation and to enhance rights of appeal is being taken as well. The amendment proposed by part 3 of the Bill to the National Measurement Act 1960 arose from a drafting oversight which could invalidate commercial contracts if not remedied. Prescriptions of all derived system international units of measurement will now, subject to guidelines, be Australian legal units of measurement. The amendment has no financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of accurate traceable measurements within a competent national measurement infrastructure is important to the quality of manufactured products as well as to scientific and technical advancement. These amendments will also allow Australia's legal units of measurement to be prescribed in a more comprehensive but abbreviated form in the national measurement regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by part 4 of the Bill to section 9a of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 will enable the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to accept gifts of up to $1m without having to obtain ministerial approval. At present, ministerial approval must be obtained for any gift, regardless of its value. The amendment will save administrative resources by reducing the number of ministerial approvals required. The amendment will also provide for future increases in the $1m threshold to be made by regulation rather than by further amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 5 of the Bill amends minor drafting errors in the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Act 1989 and the Patents Act 1990. I present to the House the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Education, Employment and Training Amendment Bill 1991. The Bill is machinery legislation designed to amend the reporting procedures of the Higher Education Council and the procedures concerning acting appointments for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, under the Employment, Education and Training Act the Higher Education Council is required to report in February and August of each year on the educational profiles process and on the operation of the higher education contribution scheme. The Bill will reduce to once a year, namely, March, the number of times the Council need report on these two matters. The subject matter of the report remains unaffected. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter concerns acting appointments. The Bill effectively permits the Minister to appoint a board member to act as a council member in either one of two cases: firstly, where a vacancy in the membership of a council results in there being fewer than two members of the board on that council; or, secondly, where the member of the council who is absent or unable to perform his duties is a member of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not opposing this Bill, I wish to foreshadow that further on in my speech I will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion and I will also be seeking to move amendments to the Bill during the committee stage. I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on the issue of the state of higher education, which is touched on in my amendment to the second reading motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and his functionary, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), continue to wreak havoc across all areas of the education portfolio. Indeed, only two days ago Mr Goss, the Labor Premier of Queensland, had this to say about the Minister for Employment, Education and Training:</PARA>
<PARA>Recently, the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John Dawkins, spoke in Parliament about his patient development of education policy . . . This is not, as far as I can tell, an assessment that is held very widely in the education community. And, as far as the Queensland Government is concerned, our patience with the Federal Minister has run out. </PARA>
<PARA>I inform the House that this was no off-the-cuff comment but rather a media release issued by the Premier's office. As we all know, Mr Goss is not the only person whose patience with the Federal Minister has run out. Academic staff at Bond University, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the Australian National University have all had to contend with the incompetence of the Minister and his junior Minister. Almost everyone involved in education has had enough of this disciple of Mr Whitlam and his failed policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Before turning to matters relating to the Bill, I should like to make some comments on the disturbing train of events in higher education since the beginning of this year, matters that are referred to in the second reading motion amendment I shall soon move. These events prove conclusively that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is intent on following the lead of the senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We all remember the desperate attempts that the junior Minister made to try to prove that he was different. The Government image makers worked overtime. Where the Minister for Employment, Education and Training was impervious to argument, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services would listen. Where the Minister for Employment, Education and Training road roughshod over higher education, he would consult. For a while there were those who thought that there would be genuine change, but the fraud has been exposed; there will be no change. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is not an independent thinker in this area; he is a loyal servant of his senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look first at the events surrounding the Australian National University. Members of this chamber will be aware that Professor Chubb has recommended that the Institute of Advanced Studies be separated from the faculties of the Australian National University. Further, he has recommended that the faculties should then be amalgamated with the University of Canberra. Most importantly, members will undoubtedly be aware that the Australian National University, its staff and its councils have emphatically rejected these recommendations. They expressed grave concerns about the impact of these recommendations on the educational mission of the university. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to discuss in detail the many sound arguments that have been advanced by the Australian National University in support of its position, but I do wish to take the opportunity to remind this House of a statement the Minister for Employment, Education and Training made some 1 1/2 years ago. Members who have been in this House longer than I will remember the explicit statement made by the Minister on 15 June 1989 during his ministerial statement on higher education. I wish to quote from this statement one of its more extraordinary and notable passages:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Government has explicitly stated that it will support only mergers which have the support of the institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know the fallacy of this statement-the threats, the arm-twisting and the financial coercion which have been used to force institutions into amalgamations they would otherwise not have entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Australian National University is different in one important respect. In all the other amalgamations the legislation which put the amalgamation into effect came from the State parliaments, but here the legislation will have to be introduced into the Federal Parliament. If such legislation is introduced whilst the Australian National University opposes an amalgamation, we will have a clear and unambiguous violation of the commitment which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training made to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I placed on the Notice Paper a question which effectively asks the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services whether they are going to honour the commitment. It is time to put up or shut up. I say with great regret that it appears that the obligation is now going to be explicitly violated. The apparent leaks being orchestrated by the Minister's office to the effect that he will pursue this legislation are a damning indictment of his contempt for institutional autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to come into this House at the end of the debate on this Bill and deliver an unambiguous statement that the undertaking given by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, which has so often been violated by the Government, will be honoured in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The chaos of the Government's forced amalgamations policy is not only being felt in the Australian Capital Territory. Victoria provides yet another example of that havoc and chaos. The tensions racking the Victorian University of Technology and its constituent institutions, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Western Institute and the Footscray Institute of Technology, provide clear evidence of the consequences of forcing an amalgamation on unwilling parties. What a potent brew we have when we combine the incompetence of the Victorian Government with the absurd policies of the Federal Government in this area. Here again the autonomy of tertiary institutions is being protected only by the coalition, not by the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> However, amalgamations are not the only matter warranting comment. I would like to spend a couple of moments on what was one of the most scandalous incidents we have seen in higher education this year: actions by a Minister which give every impression of being calculated to undermine the viability of a tertiary institution. As we all know, the Australian Labor Party has some enthusiasm for such stunts: witness the conduct of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the notorious National Australia Bank incident. His protege the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has decided to get in on the action. Like the Treasurer, he chose an institution in his area of responsibility. The victim was Bond University. In an interview on Radio 2UE, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training had this to say about Bond University:</PARA>
<PARA>It's been a failure, it's been a total failure. </PARA>
<PARA>These words, I would suggest, describe the performance of the Minister far more accurately than that of the university. The attack becomes more insidious when put in context. The context was accurately summarised by the interviewer, Mr Alan Jones, who, I might add, strongly disagreed with the comments of the Minister. Mr Jones prefaced his question with this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is speculation that you are having consultations or may be having consultations with the Queensland Government about purchasing Bond University. What truth is there in that?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA>There's nothing formal going on there. </PARA>
<PARA>But what about something informal? The Minister patently avoided rejecting the assertion in its totality. We have persistent rumours that the Government is looking at purchasing Bond University, a failure by the Minister to explicitly deny that the Government is canvassing such options and a deliberate attack on Bond University, an attack which the Minister could not have been unaware would have the effect of harming student recruitment and any resale value of Bond University. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder this Minister is as discredited as he is in the higher education community of this country. Without a cent of Federal Government support or encouragement, Bond University has been built up to an institution with 1,000 students. It was admitted to membership of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in the last year after an expert investigation. It deserves better than the premeditated attacks we have witnessed from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to return to the Bill and discuss some of the issues raised in it. In doing so, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of higher education, and in particular, it deplores the Government's-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) increasing interference in higher education through the intrusive educational profiles process;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) failure to provide a proper framework for accountability with respect to the exercise of Ministerial discretion;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) failure to provide adequately for independent policy advice;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) policy of forced amalgamations, the disruption it is presently causing in Victoria and the ACT and the damaging pressures it has created towards institutional uniformity;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility needed to address the impending shortage of academic staff;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) unsatisfactory imposition of the Higher Education Contribution charge on full fee postgraduate courses; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first matter I wish to discuss, the educational profiles process, is referred to both in the Bill and in the second reading amendment which I have just moved. When I raised the profiles issue during debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) last year, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services was dismissive. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, he assured us, supported the process. I will now take the opportunity to inform the Minister of the views of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and we can only hope that the Minister takes note.</PARA>
<PARA> Addressing-rather appropriately, given what was to occur in the future-a graduation ceremony of the Australian National University, Mr Frank Hambly, the Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA>While Mr Dawkins was at pains from the outset to claim that the system would be deregulated and that institutional autonomy would be preserved, the reality is there is scope for much more government control over higher education institutions than there was in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Reality failed to match rhetoric. How many times have we heard that said about the Government? But, in direct contradiction to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Hambly went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, through the educational profile process, the Government has considerable scope for telling institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the assertion of the Minister that the problems in the educational profiles process were merely teething problems which had to be overcome! To the contrary, these problems were integral to the profiles process itself. They confirm the comments of the late Professor John Ward, the former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, who in his 1989 annual report had this to say of the unified national system of which the educational profile process is a part:</PARA>
<PARA>It may be doubted whether any such system can really be reconciled with the individuality and distinctiveness that should characterise a really good university. The Unified National System, despite ministerial assurances to the contrary, has produced more interference with the internal affairs of universities, including their academic affairs, than I have ever experienced in nearly half a century of academic life. </PARA>
<PARA>Again rhetoric did not match reality. Again the unified national system, with its educational profile process, has led to massive interference in university affairs. And it gets worse, for this is interference without a plan. </PARA>
<PARA> When at the Senate Estimates committee hearings officials of the Department of Employment, Education and Training were questioned on the criteria they relied on in their negotiations with institutions as part of the profiles exercise, they openly admitted that there were no criteria in the light of which these negotiations take place-none that could be made available to this Parliament. Departmental officials went on to acknowledge that they had done hardly any work to assess the impact of Government policies on higher education. Alluding to this astonishing situation, the Australian Financial Review commented in an editorial last week:</PARA>
<PARA>It does seem curious that a Federal Government which admits it still has no real idea of the impact of its White Paper reforms of 1988 is continuing to pursue a vigorous reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely, given the highly intrusive nature of this process, institutions have at least a basic right to insist that the profiles are assessed against ascertainable criteria. The present arrangements have enormous potential for capricious decision making and bureaucratic interference. If the Minister really intended to act in the best interests of higher education, he would not have dismissed such concerns as the same old shibboleths. Instead, he would have taken note and changed government policy. But loyal servants do not reverse their masters' instructions, and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is a loyal servant. </PARA>
<PARA> The capacity of the Government to undertake this unprecedented level of interference in the nation's tertiary institutions is not only a function of the educational profiles process but, more importantly, a reflection on the magnitude of the Minister's powers and significant deficiencies in the independent advisory process. It is of little surprise that institutions have been imperilled when the mechanism of accountability has deficiencies as glaring as: an almost complete absence of criteria in the higher education legislation, particularly the Higher Education Funding Act for the making of decisions; minimal reporting requirements to the Parliament on the decisions made and the reasons for them; ill-defined selection criteria for membership of and for the role of advisory bodies; inadequate resources for advisory bodies and heavy reliance of those bodies on the Minister's own Department; and scope for ministerial intervention in the operations of advisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the Government did not use this opportunity to implement more fundamental reform to the pressing issues of ministerial power and the functions of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. An even greater pity has been the failure of the Government to open this matter to wider debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff shortage in higher education is another matter of enormous concern to the Opposition and to higher education in this country. The Government has made a lot of noise about the clever country, but the recent report by Dr Blandy and the National Institute for Labour Studies makes a mockery of this idea. The report paints a bleak picture for young people who want to go to university during this next decade. Universities are facing great problems in hiring staff to fill positions. We risk seeing this place a cap on student numbers, further exacerbating the problem of unmet demand. This is unacceptable when last year the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee found that up to 20,100 qualified students were unable to enter university because of an absence and lack of places. With less staff and more students, the report warns that class sizes will expand. This puts the quality of teaching seriously at risk. The report warns that by the year 2000 there could be a shortage of up to 18,900 academic staff. This is not a future problem; it is happening now. The report paints an alarming picture of worsening staff shortages and deteriorating facilities at our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that at Charles Sturt University laboratories are overcrowded to the point of reducing safety margins. Many courses at Macquarie University are described as `severely understaffed'. At Monash University, class sizes have been pushed above `acceptable levels' in many faculties. Increasing class sizes have been linked to declining teaching quality at the University of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Our universities will not be able to turn to countries overseas to fill the shortfall. There is little to encourage overseas academics to come to Australia when salaries for Australian academics have been falling compared to those overseas. Academic staff have to work in deteriorating buildings and use outdated research equipment. Despite the promise of a clever country, government funding per university student has fallen 11 per cent since the Hawke Government came to power. Coupled with increased government interference in tertiary institutions, it is no wonder that staff morale is at an all-time low. We have here a classic example of government policies not only being a significant cause of the problem but also the greatest impediment to implementing a solution. As Professor McNicol, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, bluntly advised the Government late last year, apparently to no avail:</PARA>
<PARA>A freer market for academic salaries will arise when there is a free market for universities on the income side. We should begin by canvassing alternatives to the highly regulated unified national system of higher education . . . If the Commonwealth cannot or will not increase the resources going to universities, it should not persevere with a system which impedes them from raising the funds themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>And in a similar vein, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor Penington, this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Deregulation of a kind which would allow flexibility, diversity and competition so as to attract and retain outstanding staff in the face of the looming severe international shortage of able academics will require deregulation of the present highly centralised funding system . . . We need new approaches if the problems are to be effectively solved. </PARA>
<PARA>These academic leaders of two of the leading higher education institutions in this country, to which this country owes an enormous debt, clearly realise that the ultimate protection for higher education institutions in this country is an ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. They are asking the Government quite clearly why, if it does not have the resources to help universities in this regard, it continues to persist with policies which impede them from raising income from other sources. The answer from the Government? Silence. </PARA>
<PARA> If our universities are to prosper, they need the freedom which the Federal Labor Government appears intent on denying them. University leaders know that salvation does not rest in Canberra. There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here. They have seen the results of Canberra's policies-policies which, if anything, have exacerbated the problem. It is time for the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to break out of his centralist mindset, admit that the policies have failed and give the institutions the freedom to plan to safeguard their own future. </PARA>
<PARA> Having mentioned the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee survey on unmet demand in passing, I return to this topic to make two additional comments on the matter. My first comment returns to the issue of the attack of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on Bond University. As I have already said, Bond University does not receive a cent of government support. Yet the Minister had the gall at the same time as he made the comments I quoted earlier to blame Bond University for the very high levels of unmet demand in Queensland. It is incongruous that the Minister should indicate that he was somehow relying on Bond University to cater for some of this unmet demand but then deny it any government support, and then go further and launch a highly public attack upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other comment I make concerns the solution to this problem. The response of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services has been singularly unimaginative. His response to the coalition's expressions of concern is to ask how the Opposition can raise such issues while at the same time being committed to fiscal restraint. All this serves to prove is that the Minister is ignorant of the answers which have been provided by some of the most senior academic leaders in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the issue comes down to the Government not only failing to provide the solutions but also implementing policies which impede institutions from tackling the problems from their own resources-resources with a great capacity to plan the future of their institutions if they are given the opportunity to do so. Rather than trying to pass the buck, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training did with Bond University, he and his junior Minister would have done well to have heeded the call of Professor McKinnon, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, the then Deputy Chairman and the current President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor McKinnon highlighted the anomaly in our higher education system. Australian institutions are allowed to offer fee paying undergraduate places to overseas students, but not to local students. Surely students who miss out on places and would still dearly like to go to a tertiary institution should be allowed to exercise that option and institutions should be able to exercise the option of providing them with places. Yet again, the response of the Government has been silence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is opportune that the Bill refers to the higher education contribution scheme (HECS), for the manner in which the Government has operated this scheme further exposes the shallowness of the clever country rhetoric. The Opposition has no objection to the concept that students should make some form of contribution to the cost of their course-particularly as the vast bulk of the cost of the course is met by the taxpayer. But there are courses offered by institutions on a full fee basis. There are also courses, which although offered on only a part fee basis, in other words, partial cost recovery, are subsidised not with government funds but rather out of income earned by the institution from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA> However, last year the Government made the most extraordinary announcement. The Government has instructed institutions that they must charge a minimum of twice the discounted higher education contribution scheme charge for such courses-roughly $3,340. Then the Government went further. It stated that it would take from the institutions a sum of money equating to the discounted HECS charge for each student-$1,670. It would do this by deducting this per capita sum from the operating grants of the institution. </PARA>
<PARA> What the coalition finds objectionable is that the rationale for HECS is not present in the case of such students. Taxpayer money is not being utilised in funding the education of these students. Funding is coming from the students themselves and in some cases from other revenue sources used by the institution. To thrust another burden on such people is thoroughly inequitable. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee rightly condemned this move as flying in the face of encouraging people to upgrade their skills. </PARA>
<PARA> After eight years of the Hawke Labor Government, after two to three years of the Dawkins so-called reforms, what do we have? We have unprecedented levels of government interference in higher education; the lowest staff morale we have experienced in history; record levels of unmet demand; and a chronic and worsening staff shortage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has oft claimed that our schools are in crisis. Much the same can be said about many aspects of our higher education institutions. But I raise these issues not only to highlight the Government's mismanagement, but also to illustrate that the solutions being advocated by the Opposition are very similar to the solutions being offered by a growing number of people in the higher education community. </PARA>
<PARA> The heart of the solution is to give people in higher education the freedom and flexibility to plan the future of their own institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1991. The purpose of the Bill and the aim of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is to amend certain processes contained in the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988. The Bill will simplify and thus enhance the effectiveness of the Higher Education Council's accountability measures by requiring it to report to Parliament on the operation of educational profiles and the impact of the higher education contribution scheme once a year in March rather than twice a year in February and August. It will also correct an earlier drafting inadequacy concerning the ministerial appointment of a member of the Higher Education Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The streamlining of the reporting processes is an outcome of the Government's close working relationship with the Higher Education Council, born of the desire to galvanise the restructuring of the higher education sector into the active achievement of goals rather than devolving inwardly in a web of bureaucratic requirements. It is a major goal of this Government to create the opportunities that will lead to a better educated, trained, adaptable, and motivated Australian population. Consequently, the Government's program of restructuring the higher education sector over the last three to four years has been a springboard for its commitment to meeting the challenges that Australia faces in a quickly changing and more technologically literate world.</PARA>
<PARA> Education as an end in itself is a valid objective, enriching the individual mind and nourishing the individual spirit. It is also critical to the vitality of Australia's society and economy that education be rigorously pertinent and able to meet the needs of the nation. These two objectives-the broadening of people's intellectual horizons and the development of reasoning processes; and the relevancy of curricula-should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. One does not diminish the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Education serves a partnership of needs. When the vehicle of individual intellectual pursuit is hooked up to the vehicle of social and economic needs, then education becomes a powerful catalyst for the creation of an intellectually rigorous nation embracing social equality for all and able to take its place on the international stage of global economics. To this end the establishment of a unified national tertiary system to replace the binary system-which separated the universities from the colleges, both in status and funding-has forced the higher education sector into a thorough self-examination. This is not always comfortable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the outcomes has been the recognition that as long as higher education is used as the measurement of ability for entering the job marketplace, then it must be available to everyone-not just to a select few. It is only those comfortably employed who can afford to push the barrow of educational purity solely as a means of personal fulfilment rather than as a means of getting a job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proud of its record of achievements in broadening access to education for all Australians. Its commitment to greater access to, and equity in, higher education is a major premise of its restructuring program. Particularly impressive progress has been made in the areas of financial assistance for students; women's education and training; and overseas students. In rural education and training over the period 1989-1992, $30m has been allocated for extra residential places directed particularly at improving access to higher education by rural students. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal education and training is another area on which emphasis has been placed. In 1993 the total number of earmarked places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students allocated under the Aboriginal participative initiative will rise to 3,880 equivalent full time student units-EFTSU. This is an increase of 1,390 new places for Aboriginal students over the 1991-93 triennium. Many of these achievements follow on from the Government's initiatives in the area of school education-an obviously essential precursor to higher education options. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already spoken in this chamber of the neglect in the white schools sector which needs to be addressed: neglect in inadequately presenting the sophisticated social infrastructure of traditional Aboriginal culture in school texts, and the long term adverse effect of cleansing the record of accurate details of the forcible takeover of Aboriginal land by Europeans and of the brutality and harassment which continued well into this century. </PARA>
<PARA> I will continue to speak of this neglect at every given opportunity until at last we properly meet that need. This Government has done well in starting to meet that need. Generations of white Australian students and urban Aboriginal students cut off from tribal teachers have just not had access to authentic colonial history at any level of schooling or in any institution in Australia. Many have made great progress, but overall a lot more has to be done. This blot on our education system is now in the process of being removed. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, just last Thursday, 28 February, Australia's first Aboriginal high school-Pemulwuy Koori College, which was established in 1988 in Sydney-was officially opened by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) and former Prime Minister Mr Gough Whitlam. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has given a two-year undertaking to provide about $560,000 a year to the college. At the official opening of the college, Minister Tickner described it as `the realisation of a 10-year community dream'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a dream which must become a commonplace reality as the Aboriginal education sector is expanded, countering the nightmare of institutionalised prejudice of the past, as encountered by Jimmie Barker as an Aboriginal student at a school administered by whites at Brewarrina Mission in 1913. I think Jimmie's experience is worth recounting as it gives some idea of the background for calls for funding to overcome psychological as well as physical barriers to access to all levels of education. After being taught tribal history and living skills in his earliest years, Jimmie Barker was catapulted into the harsh world of a white mission school where he learnt of cruelty and prejudice. Between 1968 and 1972, Janet Matthews interviewed Jimmie, who was born in Goondiwindi in south-western Queensland, regarding his life experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> Jimmie's description of his first day at mission school is stark in its graphic simplicity. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>School started early in February, and I shall never forget my first day . . . It was on this day that I learnt how unacceptable Aborigines are to other people. The manager told us straight out that we were just `nothing'. He continued at some length, telling us that Australian blacks were recognised as the lowest type of humanity living today. He said that it was not much use trying to teach us . . . I had to accept what Mr Keogh and his assistant, who was a preacher-schoolteacher, told us . . . During my first lessons from these men I learnt that as I was black, or partly coloured, there was no place in Australia for me. I learnt that anyone of my colour would always be an outcast and different from a white person. It gave me the firm idea that an Aboriginal, even if he was only slightly coloured, was mentally and physically inferior to all others. He was the lowest class known in the world, he was sometimes little better than an animal; in fact, dogs were sometimes to be preferred. As I was less than 12 years old it was impossible to disbelieve men of authority who were much older. I tried to stop their remarks from bothering me too much, but it was hard to adjust to being treated with such cruelty and contempt. </PARA>
<PARA>Jimmie Barker learnt, despite this sadistic and negative influence-a negativism which has continued through the school system until recent years, and the adverse effect of which we are only now striving to counter in our schools. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to succeed in our goals for expanded opportunities for and access to higher education, we must take on board the need to rectify deficiencies in every level of education, including affirmative action programs and provision of resources to enable catch-up by people disadvantaged in the past. The education dollar must be spread over all sectors. Dr Mary Ann Bin-Sallik was the first Aboriginal person to graduate from Darwin Hospital as a nursing sister. She attended Harvard University and is now head of the Aboriginal Studies and Teacher Education at the University of South Australia. Dr Bin-Sallik is reportedly taking on both government and the higher education sector in stressing the need for more funding and for better use of existing funding to fill the needs of Aboriginal scholars in universities which over past decades has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> So we need to pull together in opening access, reaching beyond the point of confrontation, to talk through our problems where they exist-not putting the egos of people in government, opposition or the higher education sector before the diverse needs of Australians in many different areas in Australia. Minister Tickner recognised this as he spoke at the opening of Pemulwuy Koori College last week. His words reflected the partnership which the Government has worked so hard to forge with State and Territory governments, education and training authorities, employer and employee organisations and individuals in the community in order to achieve its educational goals of equity, access and expansion. This is what is important in this debate. These goals will not be realised while there are haves and have-nots in the educational system. The Government realised this and initiated the difficult process of effecting change at a time when it was practising fiscal restraint in the interests of the long term economic health of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the objectives of the Government are received in the spirit in which they are made; that the awkward policy corners and the matters of concern, the anomalies which will surface in the implementation of any new policy, particularly in an area of such administrative complexity, are treated with generosity and flexibility on all sides: governmental, bureaucratic, institutional and individual. The end result will be quality education-and this certainly exists in Australia-at every level, from early childhood to tertiary; and not only for some, but for all who desire it, including women, Aboriginals, disadvantaged people and people with disabilities. This end result will surely be worth the effort. We must push forward in aiming at this goal and not become entangled in recrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of new places provided in the higher education system between 1988 and 1993 as a result of the White Paper policies is more than 70,000. This includes new intakes of approximately 2,800 and a total of about 11,000 additional places for Australian students in 1993. The costs of achieving these goals have been significant. Government spending on education, training and employment programs has risen in real terms from $6,100m in the 1986-87 financial year to $6,325m in 1988-89. During the current triennium, the higher education system will receive substantial increases in Federal Government funding, both by way of operating grants and through an injection of funds for new capital works. Approximately $11.5 billion has been committed to higher education between 1991 and 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> To help meet the cost of expanding the higher education system, an expansion so necessary for the continuing development of Australia's social and economic bases, the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) enables the people who benefit directly from higher education-that is, students-to contribute some part of the cost of their education when and if they have the capacity to do so. However, because of the wider benefits to the Australian community, the student contribution is limited to about 20 per cent of the total student education cost, while the taxpayer still meets 80 per cent of the cost-and rightly so, because money should be invested in education. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1991 HECS will raise at least $150m, and it will raise about $500m per year in about 10 years time. The Federal Government is giving a lead in seeking the funding and increasing its own funding for the sector. In the August 1990 Budget the Government announced that it will provide a total of $3.93 billion for the higher education system in 1993. This represents an increase in real terms of $90m over the sum allocated for 1992 and a 25 per cent increase over funds provided in 1988. The Government's major building program in higher education, which commenced in 1988, will amount to $960m in 1993, an increase of 125 per cent on the 1988 level. These increases, these achievements, should be recognised by this House. </PARA>
<PARA> A critical part of the strategy for managing the restructuring process is the integrated advisory structure under the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET). The Higher Education Council, to which this amendment Bill refers, reports to the Minister through NBEET, providing independent advice on a whole range of issues on higher education, including educational profiles and the granting of financial assistance to higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year the Council tabled a report in Parliament in which it noted the significant developments that have occurred within the higher education system since the Minister's reference was issued in 1988. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA>All institutions now have greater flexibility in the management of their financial and academic operations and, within the diversified system which has developed, they are encouraged to identify and build upon areas of strength in teaching and research. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also noted the Higher Education Council's responsibility for monitoring progress towards meeting the Government's equity objectives for higher education. The independent advice and review by the Higher Education Council plays, and will continue to play, a significant role in ensuring that all important policy development and implementation is carefully monitored and properly carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to spend my time in the debate on the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill looking at what is covered in the amendments. I was interested to note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), made something of the achievements of this Government in getting people to make a contribution to their education through the higher education contribution scheme (HECS). I reflect back to about 1972, when the Australian Labor Party was trumpeting that it was making tertiary education free, that it was doing away with fees of any kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition parties have always believed that people ought to contribute something for their education. But here we see the Government, 20 years later, trying to make an achievement of this. It is a total turnaround, a total U-turn in philosophical direction. It just amazes me, but it should not when we look at the way in which this Government has been acting, and particularly the Minister in charge of this area, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). He says to people, `We are headed down this way'. It is almost like Hussein saying to the troops `We're going to Kuwait', but driving them towards the Kurds up north. That is the way we find this Minister acting in regard to education. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand the Minister is saying `Yes, we are going to pursue excellence; we will pursue quality', but when we get into the heart of what is being done it is almost bankrupt. It is not quite bankrupt; there might be one criterion on quality in which he is checking over his profiles for higher education, but quite often it is absolutely bankrupt. It is typical of this Government that it raises expectations out there in the public that it is going to achieve these things, and then when the people who are supposed to benefit from these schemes try to find their way through the forest of rules and regulations and hoops they have to jump through they are totally bushed. It really is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was a year ago almost to the day that we had put to this great nation of ours that the country was going to pursue excellence and be a clever country. This time last year we were in the middle of an election. It was very close to this date when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, `We are going to become a clever country'. Yet we have a Minister in charge of this area-which is absolutely fundamental to rejuvenating and harnessing the human resources of this country so that we can be competitive and develop our potential-putting a straitjacket on higher education. He is locking them into a philosophical direction in which literally hundreds of them do not want to go. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want a country that is going to be innovative and energetic and able to meet the challenges of the 1990s and towards 2000 in a very competitive and creative world, we are going to have to allow the best minds in this country, many of whom reside in our tertiary education institutions-hopefully they will still reside there in a few more years-to exercise their creativity in what they see is vital. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House that there is no way in which all wisdom and all knowledge resides in the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. He is trying to use a straitjacket in the way he is developing higher education in this country and he expects to come out with quality. It simply will not work. Quality develops, whether in product, in the classroom or in the lecture theatre, where there is diversity, where there can be choice, where people can go in and excel. People should not feel that in history or geography or in the humanities the Government is going to look over the lecturer's or professor's shoulder and say, `The skills you are developing are not very useful out in the sort of ALP community that we would like'. We will not get excellence when we have that sort of thing happening, but that is exactly what is going on in this country today. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, even though the Minister is saying that we are allowing these people to have diversity and to think out programs of their own, in reality he has locked them in so that they have to go down a certain track. It is a most unsatisfactory situation that this country, faced with turning around a shot economy and competing in the world, is not allowing our educators to be creative and to develop our human potential in the most exciting way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it on the record that it is vitally important that if we are going to motivate our young people to allow them to be creative, we must have people in our educational institutions who want to be there and who do not feel frustrated. There are hundreds of them there today who feel frustrated. In the lecture halls, in their research and in their management programs they are not focusing on how they can do things better for the benefit of the students. They are really worried about the way in which the Government is straitjacketing them in their work and the way in which they go about it. These people have to be able to feel that they are professionals and that they are trusted to be professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of government in this area is to provide an atmosphere in which the best intellectual talent in the academic area is allowed to develop and to ensure that the system is so managed that it allows people choice, so that instead of the Government directing students on particular tram lines into our universities, the students choose themselves; they make the choices. We need a system where if a university is not coming up to standard, the students are able to move from that place. They can register their protest that the quality of education they are getting at that level is not worth a cracker. They can go somewhere else. We cannot leave that sort of choice to government bureaucracy or to a government Minister or to the executive of the Government; we must leave that choice to the students who have to go to university and get their education. They are the people who should be able to make those choices. That is not what is being encouraged at this present time. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, it is interesting to have a look at the Priorities for Reform in Higher Education report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This is not an Opposition committee. This is not a committee which is dominated by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister for Education says, that Committee is chaired by Senator Aulich, a member of the Government and a previous Minister for Education in Tasmania. What does he say about the way in which the Green Paper has been debated? He says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The recent debate about higher education stimulated by the Government's Green Paper and the White Paper has missed a point of crucial importance. The debate has focussed almost exclusively on the way the higher education system is to be structured and how it will be controlled. </PARA>
<PARA>Controlled! It is not the Liberal Party saying this; it is not the National Party; and it is not even the Democrats. This is a Labor Party chairman of a standing committee saying that the focus of so-called White and Green papers, which are supposed to make people think about education, is on control, how the Minister can be a king maker in the education area and try to manipulate and socially engineer the type of society that somehow fits into the Labor Party mould. That is what is going on and that is what is being said by quite a courageous person in the party-that it is all about control. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go on a little further in regard to this area and look at the Budget explanatory notes on the Employment, Education and Training portfolio. Those notes are found in a fairly large document comprising 296 pages. It contains a comprehensive exposition of all the performance indicators utilised by the Government to determine the effectiveness of programs in the portfolio. What do we find? There is one indicator of quality for higher education. This gets back to the point that I was making earlier: the Minister says that he will go in one direction, but in reality, when one looks at the details, the hard evidence, one finds absolutely nothing. When we consider that the Government has the temerity in the explanatory notes to discuss performance indicators, yet has only one indicator of performance in regard to higher education, we find that to be quite incredible two to three years after the Government's White Paper. It is absolutely mind-boggling. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister referred to some of the recent Senate Estimates Committee hearings on the current Budget session. I want to speak about what we found when departmental officials were questioned in depth about whether they had investigated the impact of the Government's policies. Here we have a government which has been in office for eight years. One would have thought that the changes in the Government's policy areas, lauded as being magnificent changes that would bring enormous benefits to this country, would have been checked out to see whether some benefits were coming through. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, what do we find from the officials? What do they say? They were asked whether the Government had undertaken any studies to ascertain whether a primary objective of the amalgamation process, namely, increased efficiency in administration, had been realised in our higher education area. The answer was that no studies had been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The officials were asked whether the Government had any plans to undertake any such studies in the future. What do honourable members think the answer was? The answer was that there were no plans to do so. This Government keeps throwing up new ideas, more ideas, every couple of years or maybe less. It holds big press conferences and produces a lot of glossy magazines which come into our electorate offices in stacks and piles. I say, `I wonder what happened to the last one?' If we go back to check whether the Government achieved anything with the last program, whether the performance indicators have actually been achieved, we find that the Government has not even checked whether they have been achieved. Yet it is onto a new program using taxpayers' money on producing more glossy magazines. It all looks good on television; it all makes great press conference material. But out in the Australian community, the education system is going down the tube. That is a great tragedy. Instead of spending a lot of time talking and glossing and doing media interviews, this Government would do far better by ensuring that some of the programs really got to the people who needed them, who are crying out for them. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time when unemployment is skyrocketing-it has been about 25 per cent higher for the last eight years under this Government than it was under the previous coalition government-where are these young people going? Families at this stage, particularly the less well off families, have one hope for their children. They would virtually do anything to provide their children with a good education. Yet the Government of this country is failing to provide the sort of environment to young people which will make them excited about the Australia they go into, which will give them the skills, knowledge and attitudes that will be of great benefit to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We need leadership in this country on the issue of education. We need leadership from the top down, so that people can be enthused; so that young people can be enthused; so lecturers can be enthused; so the administrators in our universities can be enthused about the work they are doing and feel excited about it. That is how to get morale up and that is how to get quality performance in the classrooms and the lecture theatres. That is how to get quality people out into industry and into all fields in which we have to be competitive in the world. We will not get quality in higher education by having the straitjacketed approach which is being implemented by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker said that the coalition parties had allowed only a select few people into higher education. Yet why is this Government denying higher education institutions the capacity to go out and raise their own funds? Why do they have to be hamstrung by receiving only Government funds? Why is the first private university in Australia being knocked? Why do we not give it some support? Why does the Government not give support to these people who are prepared to have a go? There are 1,000 students attending that university; why not give them support and encourage other people to participate in education? Do not knock them. After all, not only government dollars provide good education; good education can come from industry or benefactors-it can come from anywhere. The very fact that this Government is limiting funding in that way and not opening up the doors means that there will be about 20,000 people who are qualified to go to university but who will have to stand outside the university gates. They will not be able to get in because there will be no places. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that we have had an opportunity to debate the subject of education. We do not get very many opportunities to do so. But, with the economic state of the nation as it is, there is a great need for the national imperatives such as education to be looked after and dealt with effectively. Quite frankly, only a coalition government can now provide that sort of enthusiasm and freedom. We have to have a change in atmosphere. Parents and young people have to have the right to choose which institutions they go to; they should not be dictated to by government programming. Different sectors must have the right to be able to expand and meet the demand as they see fit. It is only when we do that and it is only when we have an open liberal philosophy, as a coalition government would have in this area, that we will get the type of education system which will put Australia back on the right path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and to oppose the amendment that has been moved. I start by saying that I agree with the last sentiment which was expressed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I, too, welcome the opportunity to debate tertiary education, in particular, in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment Bill that is before us is a pretty straightforward one which involves the reports of the Higher Education Council to Parliament on the operation of education profiles and the impact of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS). In the past the Higher Education Council has been instructed to, and does, report twice a year on the education profiles of higher education institutions-mostly universities-and also on the operation of the HECS, whereby students participating in higher education pay for some of the costs of their education. In the past it had reported twice a year but it is now proposed that the Council need only report once in each year, both on the profiles and on the impact of the HEC scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome very much the fact that this simple Bill has elicited 10 speakers from the Opposition-at least according to the last speakers list that I saw. I welcome very much not only the fact that we have 10 speakers from the Opposition, but also the fact that the Opposition spokesman for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who was on the front bench, has now moved into the shadow Cabinet and that he has not been one of the part time Opposition spokesmen on education that we have been faced with over the last few years. He is actually a man from the sector who knows something about it, even though I believe very deeply that he is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I also read in the newspaper this morning that another person from the political science sector of the tertiary education system, Colin Rubinstein, may be joining us. I welcome that opportunity for him to join us by way of the seat of Menzies which has now been vacated by its previous member because he was fed up with a long period in opposition which he did not anticipate would come to an end at the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we are now facing such an extensive debate does not spring from the character of the Bill that is before us but, rather, from the nature of Government policy in tertiary education and the resistance shown by the Opposition parties-including that resistance, now that they are under more determined leadership, that they will show towards the direction we have taken. It is appropriate that, in the first instance, I say something about the direction that Government policy has taken and why it has taken that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the many other sectors of our economy, society and government policy, the development of higher education in this country, not surprisingly, comes partly from planning and partly from growing like topsy. Historically, before the Second World War we had a limited number of universities which serviced, for the most part, the elite of this society-particularly that part of elite society who could not afford to go to Britain. We also had a number of teacher training colleges alongside them. It is to the eternal credit of Sir Robert Menzies that when he was Prime Minister of this country he took that ramshackle and rather backward sector and injected large sums of money into it and brought the university sector, in particular, up to an international standard which attracted scholars from all over the world. I pay tribute to the now Opposition parties for their recognition of tertiary education when they were in government during the 1950s and particularly the 1960s and for the work done by the Menzies Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to power in the early 1980s the sector remained rather uncoordinated. It was funded in a rather haphazard way and was the subject of different levels of government regulations-State, as opposed to Federal-which had sprung out of the rapid expansion of the Menzies years, then the abolition of fees and the changing of funding during the Whitlam years and the stagnation of the Fraser years. What this Government has tried to do is produce a rationalisation of the sector, an improvement in its funding base, a growth in the sector and, perhaps most importantly, an improvement in the access by Australians to that sector. </PARA>
<PARA> With those goals in view, the Government has set out a number of objectives. One objective has been to produce an amalgamation of the various institutions in the tertiary sector so as to reduce their number and to designate them all as universities to be funded on a more or less equal basis-and I will say something about the equality of funding in a moment. The shadow Minister for education has alleged that these amalgamations have been forced. This has not been the case. I will illustrate this with respect to one point. The Australian Labor Party has not been able to force-even if that were its intention-amalgamations which have already taken place in New South Wales where the State Government, which has the legislative power in the sector, is of course a Liberal government. What has happened in that sector in that State is that the amalgamation process has been more rapid, more determined and more State-directed than in any other State of the Commonwealth. I do not decry that; I simply point this out as a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> There have certainly been some financial inducements, in the form of assistance, given to former colleges and universities which have sought to amalgamate, but amalgamation has not been imposed upon them-nor do I anticipate that it will be in the future with regard to those universities and colleges which are presently considering such a leap. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I should make is that amalgamations have been funded in some measure by the collection of HECS revenue from students who have benefited from the university sector and who have thereby gained access to degrees which, it was calculated two or three years ago, are worth around $400,000 in lifetime earnings for graduates as opposed to nongraduates. So it is only appropriate that they should pay some of the cost of their training. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that the shadow Minister alleges this, but elsewhere it has been alleged that these HECS fees have had an effect on students of lower income families and that they have been inegalitarian in their imposition. The evidence that is available so far shows quite the contrary-that the number of people applying for tertiary education places since the introduction of HECS has increased and that it has benefited lower income groups. However, I concede that the evidence on this matter is not conclusive and the Higher Education Council has commissioned Professor Cass to undertake a study into this. I await the results in order to confirm the preliminary findings to which I refer. </PARA>
<PARA> As this expansion has taken place, access to the tertiary education sector has improved, particularly for those sectors of our society who were previously denied access to it- I note here the participation rates of women, people from non-English speaking and ethnic backgrounds, Aboriginal people, poor people and working class people. My colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) has already identified many of these programs and their success rates and I will say no more about them at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Also to be noted is the fact that the educational profiles with which we deal in this amendment Bill are now negotiated between the institutions and the Government. I merely say this: the Government provides almost the entire cost of the tertiary education system with the exception of Bond University, to which I have no particular objection. Whilst its funding arrangements are firm, whilst its academic standards are up to scratch-and I have no knowledge of either of these-I have no particular objection to Bond University and I welcome the initiative of private entrepreneurs who wish to initiate such institutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing that in the United States a number of private universities function extremely well. I have not taught in any of them. I have given seminars in private universities in the United States. I certainly note no particular difference between private and state universities where I have taught. I have no particular objections to the private development of tertiary education in this country, and whilst it complies with the general standards I will not voice any. </PARA>
<PARA> However, those institutions which are funded by the public purse do have to offer some accountability for the form of expenditure they undertake, the way in which they deliver services and to whom, and what kind of services are provided. One may be able to quarrel with the form of educational profiles as they are negotiated, and I will make a few critical remarks about them in a moment if I have the time. However, in general and in principle, it seems to me only appropriate that people who manage tertiary education and absorb over $3.5 billion worth of public purse expenditure every year should have some accountability to the government, which is elected periodically, in order to pursue public policy and national interest programs. So in principle I can see no objection to the negotiation of profiles for these institutions although, in particular, the administration of them may excite some objections which I think this chamber should, correctly, debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that context let me put what has actually been achieved in tertiary education before I come back to the amendments proposed by the Opposition to this Bill. As I have already suggested, the important components are change, rationalisation, improvement of access, some greater accountability of the expenditure of the public purse. But perhaps the single word that we would identify with our policies towards tertiary education is `growth'. If one looks at any identifiable criteria towards our policies on tertiary education, it can be seen we have undertaken the growth of the sector, and I will return to the direction and structure of that growth in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take, for example, real capital funding, in 1993 it will be $200m, more than five times that of 1983. From 1989 to 1993, $900m has been set aside for capital, including more than $30m for student residences, which I trust will assist country students who, particularly in my own State of South Australia, have not had a fair crack of the whip in terms of access to tertiary education over the last 150 odd years. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Government allowed capital in real terms to drop from approximately $200m per year in 1976 to $35m in 1982, and there has been a steady expansion of capital funding under this Government, particularly over the last few years. It has been directed particularly to areas where there should be growth, either for reasons of identifiable demand or for reasons of definable social equity access programs. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some examples, the University of Western Sydney will receive more than $100m to accommodate a massive student expansion. Western Sydney has a population generally conceded to be at least half as much again as the city which I represent, and that huge urban area has offered almost no access to universities for the people who live in it-mostly people who vote for us, mostly working class people, and mostly people who are socially disadvantaged in so far as access to cultural and educational opportunities are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in South Australia, much of our capital expenditure will go to the new University of South Australia which has been formed by the amalgamation of some other institutions. We are not being merely fixated with the concentration on social equity. The University of Adelaide Law School, generally regarded as one of the producers of the elite of the legal profession and of the business world in South Australia, is also getting a couple more floors on its building in order to provide more student places. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the White Paper, student places in general, in aggregate, have grown in the following way: in 1989, 6,500; in 1990, 5,800; in 1991, 4,800; in 1992, next year, 4,000; and in 1993, 3,000, with a pipeline effect, as the honourable member for Lilley suggested, of 70,000 extra places between 1989 and 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Correspondingly, the funds available for the system have grown from 1983, and in real terms these are from $2.6 billion, to 1993 when there will be $3.8 billion put into the system. It is not possible to say we have contracted access to research in the sector, since if we look at the funding of Australian Research Council (ARC) programs, it will grow from 1983 when it was $63m, to the first year of the ARC, $86m, to $208m this year. That is a very substantial increase of 240 per cent. In addition, $175m has been made available over the period 1989-1994 for new funds for research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a huge expansion of postgraduate student award schemes to provide a total of 1,000 new places annually, together with a substantial increase in stipends available. A number of other schemes have been introduced over the last year or so to improve access to research, not just for the university sector, but for all those institutions prepared to undertake research in, for example, our new cooperative research centres program which will build up to $100m, available from Commonwealth funds, hopefully to be matched by other parts of the advanced technology and learning system. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced educational profiles, and the shadow Minister quoted a number of people in opposition to these profiles. It would be possible for me, if time were available, to quote a similar number of people, until one or other of us was exhausted or exhausted our files on the system, approving the introduction of educational profiles, either on the basis that they gave more accountability for institutions, or on the basis that they provided a more solid and longer term basis for planning for the growth and development of the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out, I do not say that the shadow Minister said this and I in no way criticise him for doing so-I noticed that at the beginning of this academic year many student newspapers at our universities were provided with press releases from other political parties which alleged that the higher education contribution scheme funding model is going to disadvantage people from underprivileged backgrounds-the poor, the lower income groups and so on. This is decidedly not the case. It has in fact improved their access to tertiary education by expanding the number of places generally, by improving access to Austudy and therefore liberating them from the imposition of loans and so on. HECS, although its rate of repayment is to be accelerated under the Budget introduced last year, will only cut in at somewhere around average weekly earnings, which is about $25,000 plus a year. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have undertaken, and what this Bill has to be seen against the background of, is an expansion of tertiary education, an expansion which is to benefit not just the students who enter into it-and I hope all of them will benefit in the way that I have, and I am sure the shadow Minister benefited in his day-but also the institutions in their quest for the maintenance and augmentation of human knowledge and the nation as a whole. For many years we have lagged desperately behind comparable developed countries in the training of our work force across the board, and spectacularly in the tertiary education and university sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me finally return to the amendment which has been moved by the shadow Minister and which I oppose. In the amendment he refers to the continuing mismanagement of higher education, and in his speech he referred to the havoc wreaked by this Government in tertiary education. We have indeed changed the tertiary education system substantially and for the better. Those who see that as havoc or continued mismanagement-the kind of expansion, the improvement of access, of opportunity that we have provided for Australia's young people, indeed for mature people and people who have missed the boat previously-have it at their feet to prove why this has been disadvantageous. </PARA>
<PARA> It is alleged in paragraph (a) of the amendment that increased interference through the intrusive educational profile process is to be condemned. It is not perfect, and I am sorry that I am running too short of time to give detailed provisions on this score. It is not perfect, but I believe it balances the rights of students to a good education, the long term planning needs of institutions to regularise their funding base, and also the rights of the Australian taxpayer to have some say in how $3.5 billion plus is expended.</PARA>
<PARA> The accountability of the Minister and the independent policy advice is to be found in the various reports that have been produced and published and these are available to the public if they wish to read them. As I have said, we have commissioned a further study by Professor Cass into the effects of the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not and, as far as I am concerned, we do not intend to undertake the policy of forced amalgamations, as is claimed in clause (d) of the Opposition amendment. As a member of the Australian National University Council, I well know that this has been discussed very widely and so far the Chubb report has been condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the failure to provide institutions with freedom and flexibility, the Government has encouraged the new university structure to seek access to funds from elsewhere. It is with great regret that I report that the commercialisation arm of the university system has not been able to attract and generate funds at the level that I and the Government had hoped was appropriate only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the shadow Minister approves in principle the higher education contribution charge. Irrespective of whether it is inappropriate to impose HECS in the particular way he specifies in clause (f) of the Opposition amendment, I cannot agree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The final clause-clause (g)-concerns the Government's alleged failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand. The reason for the unmet demand which exists, and which I hope will be rectified as soon as possible, is that we have not only massively expanded tertiary education, but we have also expanded the secondary school system and secondary school output has grown faster than the tertiary level input. I hope that they will be matched in the near future. I believe that the Opposition wants to return to an elitist past where tertiary education is run by the professoriate, serves the elite out of the school system to the exclusion of working class people, people from ethnic backgrounds, women and the poor. I support very strongly the Government's policy and oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), I say that havoc, like beauty, is perhaps in the eye of the beholder. Winston Churchill may well have been speaking about the Government's higher education policies when he said, `It is a riddle, wrapped in mystery inside an enigma'. What is most certainly a mystery to all on this side of the House is how long the Government can continue its mismanagement of Australia's higher education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reading amendment to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1991, which was earlier moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), outlines the areas and ways in which the Government has failed Australia in terms of higher education. I will again just briefly go through this amendment to remind the House of this catalogue of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment refers to the continued mismanagement of higher education and particularly the Government's increasing interference in higher education as facilitated by the intrusive educational profiles process. It also refers to the Government's failure to provide a proper framework for accountability with respect to the exercise of ministerial discretion and its failure to provide adequately for independent policy advice. The amendment also covers the fiasco of the forced amalgamations and the disruption it is causing in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory and the Government's failure to provide institutions with the freedom and flexibility that they need to address their impending shortage of academic staff. It then refers to the unsatisfactory imposition of the higher education contribution scheme charge on full fee postgraduate courses and, finally, the Government's failure to make inroads into the level of unmet demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather disappointed that the honourable member for Adelaide has left the chamber, but I would have thought that as a former academic, he, of all people on that side of the House, might have been able to agree with most of those points. In the time that I have this afternoon, I would like to concentrate particularly on that last point-that of the failure of the Government to make inroads into the level of unmet demand. </PARA>
<PARA> We quite often hear from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who stands up and trumpets his success-like the Treasurer (Mr Keating), I assume-as the world's greatest education Minister. He tells us how much he has done for retention and participation rates in high schools. Of course he has increased retention rates in high schools. As I understand it, that is largely attributable to the influence of Austudy. Of course so many more children are staying on at high school now. A lot of those students have unrealistic expectations about their careers. Instead of perhaps going into apprenticeships-which is something we need more of in Australia-they now have an expectation of going on to higher education at the university level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, therefore, has created this problem. On the one hand it has created these higher retention rates in high schools, as desirable at least in isolation as they may seem to be. But, having created an expectation on behalf of those students who stay at high school longer, it has simply failed to meet the level of demand that is created for higher education as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier speakers have mentioned Queensland because it surely is a glaring case in point. I heard remarks reported this morning that apparently yesterday the Minister finally admitted, in the face of direct criticism by Premier Goss who stated that his patience had finally run out, that Queensland had been poorly treated. In that respect he is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk for a few moments this afternoon about my electorate of McPherson, which is situated on Queensland's Gold Coast and is the fastest growing area of Australia. The Albert Shire Council area, which I share with the neighbouring electorate of Moncrieff, has an annual growth rate of 12 per cent. That is apparently the highest growth rate of any local government area, certainly in Australia and actually in the world. This compares with the growth rate of around 4 per cent for the western Sydney area. Interestingly, as we look at who represents western Sydney, not the least being our infamous Treasurer, we see that this is where a lot of government expenditure in higher education is being placed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gold Coast-Brisbane corridor is expected to have a population of one million people by the year 2000. The current population on the Gold Coast itself, which comprises the Gold Coast City Council and Albert Shire Council, is around 350,000 people. This population is currently directly serviced by just one public university-the Gold Coast University College of the Griffith University, which was previously the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education (CAE), and that is situated at Southport. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Gold Coast College of Griffith University has a total enrolment of 2,405 commencing and continuing students doing 10 different courses. The Government quota for new student places for 1991 for the Gold Coast College was just 737. This contrasts dramatically with the first preference demand for places through the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre, which was 2,131. This simply means that on the Gold Coast 1,400 people who put the Gold Coast university as their first choice of an educational institution simply missed out. They either missed out or had to go somewhere else-but they live on the Gold Coast. These sorts of figures of people missing out on gaining access to their preferred educational institution are, as I understand it, on a par with what is happening in the rest of Australia. Despite this huge demand, the Government has failed to even meet the physical needs of accommodation of those 2,400 Gold Coast students who are currently enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put this in context. The Gold Coast CAE, as it was originally called, began operations in Surfers Paradise Primary School in 1987. Its first permanent building was not actually available until two years later, when the college's population reached 1,000 students. In fact, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training came to the Gold Coast and opened the permanent building of the College of Advanced Education in March 1989. He indicated in his flourishing opening speech, and I underline this, that funding would be made immediately available for stage 2 of the CAE. However, at the beginning of this year, 1991, stage 2 was still not completed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to admit that the builder went broke and that held things up for a little while-but that is the Government's fault too, so it is really compounding the errors here. Notwithstanding that, the Government's record of provision of facilities for what is now the Gold Coast University College of Griffith University is absolutely abysmal. We now have college facilities for 700 students housing 2,400 students. The overflow is crowded into demountable buildings, the church across the road, the showground down the road, and even the Southport Primary School. The Government has simply failed abysmally-I use that word again-to keep up with the growth in this area, as it has failed, on the admission of the Minister today, in respect of Queensland as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training recently announced and stressed that it was allocating no extra capital up to and including 1993 and that there would be no new buildings or facilities at least until 1994. This is absolutely ludicrous. It does not take a genius to see that, with the increasing level of demand and the growth in population in Queensland and particularly on the Gold Coast, continued expansion of both buildings and courses is required if the university is to meet the needs of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members one more specific example, as if this has not been damming indictment enough of the Government's treatment of Queensland. The University College happens to have a Bachelor of Education degree. It is offered to full time teachers; in fact, it is an upgrading facility for them to improve their qualifications. There were 40 places available in that course this year and there were three full time teachers, who obviously worked on the Gold Coast, applying for each one of those positions-three applications for every one position available. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, can pass this question on to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training: how does the Federal Government expect these teachers to obtain their Bachelor of Education when they are working full time on the coast? If they cannot go to the Gold Coast University College, the nearest university on the north side of Brisbane is around 75 minutes drive away. Does the Minister honestly expect teachers after school to drive 75 minutes to the college, attend their course and then drive 75 minutes home? Perhaps he does, but it shows his ridiculous lack of understanding about the problems in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the building program at the Gold Coast University College running years behind schedule, despite the Minister's commitment-and taking into account, as I am prepared to, that the builder went broke-it has also been held up by the process of amalgamation. Plenty has been said about this. The honourable member for Goldstein talked about it. What a fiasco it has been. This afternoon I want to place on record for the Minister a couple of questions about that. I ask him to indicate whether there are any indications that Australian institutions are producing better quality graduates as a result of amalgamations. Second, is there any data or research which shows that large scale amalgamations lead to greater efficiencies or real cost reductions? I suspect the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very interesting contrast here. On the one hand, the needs of the Gold Coast in tertiary education have been overlooked by the Minister, yet the Minister has been very quick and vocal about singling out another educational institution. That has already been talked about, but I want to bring this message home to the Minister so that he can understand how much damage he is doing in the area of his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked about my electorate before, with its tourist capital of Surfers Paradise, of which I am proud. I am also very proud that my electorate has the honour of including Australia's first private tertiary institution. We are talking here of Bond University, which has been mentioned earlier. I want to say a little about what the Government has done to help-and I use that word extremely loosely-Bond University. Recently the Minister had a little to say about Bond University-but nothing constructive, I might say. On the contrary, he made some very damaging statements about some nebulous plan to buy out the university. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Sunday I attended an open day at Bond University. I am pleased to tell the Minister and the Parliament that Bond University continues to go from strength to strength. About 4,500 people attended the open day. My wife and I and our family enjoyed it very much; it was quite enlightening. A lot of people were interested in finding out about the courses Bond was offering. I have talked to a few students of Bond who are former students of public institutions. They describe their attendance at Bond as a very refreshing change. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the Government's commitment to competition? It has gone right out the window. It has had the opportunity to encourage Bond University and it has failed to do it. Fortunately the marketplace is such that it is recognising the value of the courses offered by Bond. There are currently 1,160 students enrolled at Bond. The January enrolment this year was 16 per cent up on the same time last year. It is anticipated that enrolment will continue to grow at the same rate. I am pleased to say that, of those enrolled at Bond University, around 40 per cent are Gold Coast residents. These are pretty impressive figures for a fledgling university. If we contrast the growth rates of Bond University with those of Griffith University, they are extremely impressive. Bond has survived despite this Government, and particularly despite this Minister</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely hostile from the start. He has been ideologically bent on destroying Bond University. His comments implied that Bond was in some sort of financial difficulty at the beginning of the semester when students were contemplating enrolment. This was totally incomprehensible and completely irres-ponsible. As one of the earlier speakers said, it is like the Treasurer (Mr Keating) talking about the National Bank of Australia. His comments were calculated to have exactly the same effect. At the time people were thinking about which university they would go to, the Federal Minister started spreading scurrilous rumours about the viability of Bond University. Fortunately, he was wrong, wrong, wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I got a great deal of pleasure out of reading a report in the Gold Coast Bulletin about the Minister's recent visit to Bond University. The headline is `Third Degree for Dawkins'. I do not know whether he has one degree yet, but he got the third degree on the Gold Coast. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Federal Education Minister John Dawkins last night entered the lion's den at Bond University and walked into an angry confrontation over his claims the campus was an abject failure. </PARA>
<PARA> An embarrassed welcoming committee watched while a clearly shaken Mr Dawkins argued with a student protester who blocked his path. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins, with his face only inches from the protester's, tried to explain the basis of his criticism but the man, in his early 30's, shouted at him and then moved away as the minister was led quickly into the university buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> The minister has also enraged Acting Vice-Chancellor Raoul Mortley, who reacted last night by accusing the Minister of `systematic attacks' which he believed were sinister. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday Professor Mortley said that Bond University chiefs were convinced the Federal Government had a secret plan to buy the private university, but he was adamant the institution would not become a public campus. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night an unrepentant Mr Dawkins stood by his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose if we were really to attribute a despicable motive to the Minister, we might suspect that in talking down Bond University he is trying to get the price down. If this really were a tactic, one might suspect that was his motive-that in tipping the financial bucket on Bond University he was hoping the stocks would fall so low that he would come out like a white knight and make an offer to buy it. But it is not for sale, and I do not know when he will get the message. He might as well realise that it is there to stay. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud to have Bond University in my electorate. I applaud the standard of teaching there and I enjoy the prospect of observing further expansion, growth and success for Australia's first private tertiary institution. The Government, as I said, has not made life easy for Bond. The recent saga surrounding its school of science and technology is another case in point. Here we had an excellent faculty which the Government allowed to be decimated. The Government stood by. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to read the letter, but I wrote to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) imploring him to save the Bond University science team. I wrote to him on 13 November, suggesting the matter was urgent-which it was. On 10 January, almost two months later, I received a letter back from his senior private secretary. The letter was a complete cop-out; it said that it was not the Minister's problem. I wrote a further letter to the Minister's private secretary saying I found that both surprising and disappointing. And I certainly did. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to provide opportunities for Australian children to take maths and science seriously. Unless this trend is reversed, we as a country will go nowhere. We will certainly never be a clever country. It is no coincidence that the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Gold Coast College of Griffith University, Professor Jones, announced yesterday that he was joining the brain drain of Australian academics. He has accepted a position as professor of mathematics education at Illinois State University, and there in America he will have the opportunity to be involved in his area of expertise, mathematics. Apparently education in this area is not important to the Government. Coincidentally, Professor Michael Tweedey, the Dean of Bond University Faculty of Information Sciences, is also leaving the University. </PARA>

I was speaking about education in general, and I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson, spoke in general terms on education as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak about the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and, of course, I oppose the amendments that were moved here today. To keep the honourable member for Gippsland happy, I go on and say that this Bill is about a continuation of the Hawke Government's commitment to equality and accountability in the education system. The Hawke Government has a proud record in education, providing education right across the board for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of this dedication is seen in this legislation in the replacement of the current requirement for the Higher Education Council report in February and August of each year; instead, the Council will be required to report once a year, in March. This amendment is designed to overcome difficulties faced by the Higher Education Council in providing substantial reporting in August, as at this time of the year firm data is unavailable for the year's higher education student enrolments in relation to the education profile visits, which are not undertaken until later in the calendar year. To a lesser extent, the same provisions in place at the moment inhibit the ability of the Council to provide meaningful and accurate reports on the impact of the higher education contribution scheme, which is better known as HECS. The Bill will thus enable the Government to gain a better perception of the true position in the education arena. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to concentrate on the importance of education profiles and how integral they are to the broadening access to higher education. It would be remiss of me not to address the part played by the higher education contribution scheme in achieving this goal. This Government recognised some time ago that the cost of expanding the higher education system to meet community needs is high and decided that those people who benefit directly from higher education, the students, should contribute some part of the cost of their education when they have the capacity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government realised society also derives great benefit from a better educated society, so the student contribution is limited to about 20 per cent of the total cost of a student's education, while the taxpayer meets the other 80 per cent. The scheme provides flexibility and the students can elect to pay their contribution either up front, in which case they receive a 15 per cent discount, or through the taxation system. Students who elect to pay their contributions through the taxation system will start payments only when their taxable income reaches about average annual earnings. All the revenue raised through HECS will go into a special trust and can be used only to help fund new higher education places and to expand and upgrade the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the importance of postgraduate research to Australia's future, higher education institutions were provided with 15,000 postgraduate scholarships in 1989, the introductory year of the scheme, to provide exemption from HECS for one academic year. The scholarships are intended to encourage academic excellence, scholarships and research in Australia's higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same year a further 4,000 scholarships were made available to encourage teachers to upgrade their professional qualifications, with education authorities in each State awarding these scholarships to teachers according to guidelines provided by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of higher education in Australia and the associated need to ensure that all Australians have access to gaining tertiary qualifications are both priorities that are captured in the use of education profiles. The realisation of the goal to expand tertiary access will be achieved through the identification of six specific target groups, these being people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, women, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities and people from rural and isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Given my involvement with a number of committees in the Parliament dealing with the plight of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, I wish to make some comments in relation to this group and, in doing so, see what benefits would be derived by them from this legislation. I am pleased to see the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) at the table. The targets set for the education of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are: a 50 per cent increase in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enrolments in higher education by the year 1995; and an increase in the proportion of bachelor degree enrolments to 50 per cent of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enrolments by 1992 and 60 per cent by 1995. Particular attention is also paid to graduation rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to that of the total student population by 1995 and the degree of participation of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in courses such as law, business and administration, medicine and health. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, the Government set about addressing the educational deficiencies of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders when it formed the Aboriginal education policy task force. The charter of the task force was to develop a comprehensive long term approach to Aboriginal education policy across all education sectors. Before reconstruction, however, the current position had to be defined. The grim statistics facing the task force were: the Aboriginal higher education participation rate of two per cent is about half that of all Australians; only four per cent of Aboriginal people aged 20 to 24 are in higher education or formal training, compared with 20 per cent of all Australians in this age group; and only 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population aged 15 and over has post-secondary qualifications, compared with 31 per cent of the total population. The task force found that Aboriginal people are the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The targets mentioned previously as part of the Government's Fair Chance For All strategy which is encompassed in this legislation are ambitious to say the least, but nevertheless they are realistic targets that can be achieved, for the realisation of these goals has a strong foundation in the progress already made by the Government in the area of Aboriginal education. </PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis here has been at the grassroots with the Government working to increase the number of Aboriginal teachers in the more elementary levels of education. In its first three years, the Hawke Government's policies increased the number of Aboriginal teachers by 70 per cent from 220 to 374 at the beginning of 1986, that information being taken from Achievements in Aboriginal Affairs, 1987. As the number of Aboriginal teachers continues to increase, the education system will become more responsive to the needs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, giving these people further encouragement to obtain qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar progress is documented in the enrolment of Aboriginal students. In 1983, there were only about 700 Aboriginal students enrolled in higher education courses leading to awards. This meant that the relative participation rate for Aboriginal students was only one-fifth the rate for the overall population. By 1986, as a result of initiatives taken by the Government, the number had doubled to over 1,500. </PARA>
<PARA> The important link here has been the Government's success in improving retention rates in secondary education far greater than in any other period in Australia's history. For an accurate comparison, the same three year period 1983-86 yielded an increase of more than 12 per cent in the retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary students. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's social justice ethos has continued since this time and was given further support in this year's Budget. The end result is a $230m injection into improving education facilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This initiative will go a long way to boosting technical and further education (TAFE) and higher education participation and completion rates and developing long term policies to achieve greater employment and training of Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people in education. </PARA>
<PARA> The tripartite discussions between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Commonwealth and education systems which preceded the Budget announcement will continue the Government's social justice philosophy through the 21 goals which have been set to achieve equitable access to and participation in education by Australia's indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best example of the Government's commitment to achieving greater equity is the inclusion in the Budget of funding for Aboriginal students in mainstream education. To this end, 100 of the additional places in 1993 will be specifically set aside for Aboriginal students and funded at a higher rate to allow for necessary support services. In 1993, the total number of places earmarked for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students allocated under the Aboriginal participation initiative will rise to 3,880. This is an increase of 1,390 new places for Aboriginal students over the 1991-93 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> Extensive consultations between the Aboriginal education policy task force, State and Territory education authorities and Aboriginal organisations gave birth to the national aboriginal education policy, announced in October 1989. This represented a landmark achievement for Australia's indigenous peoples through its setting out of a national strategy to take all possible steps to redress the educational inequality faced by Aboriginal people in all sectors of education. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the relatively high Aboriginal population in my electorate of Oxley, I am naturally pleased to see the $230m that has been allocated over the triennium 1990-92 for Aboriginal education under the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy-a testament to the cooperative approach with which the three groups viewed the need to improve access to education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Following landmark agreements between Federal, State and Territory governments, this money has begun to flow into education systems across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the various education strategies will vary in each of the States and Territories, some of the common themes to be addressed in the strategies include increased Aboriginal involvement in educational direction; a commitment to equitable access and participation in pre-schools, primary and secondary schools, TAFE post-schooling and higher education; and a commitment to the equitable employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's education systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to Austudy and Abstudy announced in the Budget also sit well within the Government's education equity framework. The decision to increase the maximum personal income level for students from $3,000 to $4,000 before benefits would be affected will be of particular assistance to the disadvantaged groups identified earlier, as it is usually these groups' families who are least able to support their children through education. </PARA>
<PARA> Of benefit not only to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups but also to all the groups identified in the discussion paper A Fair Chance For All has been the higher education contribution scheme. A scheme where graduates pay for a proportion of their education at a rate comparable to their ability to pay captures the very essence of equity, for it is only fair that Australia's student population is a true and proper reflection of the composition of our society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> But for this support to bring maximum benefit to the disadvantaged groups identified in A Fair Chance for All who wish to go on to higher education, each tertiary institution must develop its own education profile, its own face, something which clearly distinguishes it and its needs from other institutions. That very spirit is encompassed in the Government's provision for conditions of grant to be modified to reflect a change in emphasis from specific projects to institutions, achieving participation targets for their disadvantaged groups as set out in their equity plans. </PARA>
<PARA> A point to be noted is that the concept of educational profiles has been welcomed by the education system since being introduced following the White Paper on higher education in 1988. In its paper, Higher Education for the 1990s, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) indicated that it supports:</PARA>
<PARA>the educational profile concept as it has been refined, with annual reviews and updates to the former CTEC `wish list' arrangement and associated triennial visits. </PARA>
<PARA>Institutions have acknowledged constructive ways in which discussions take place and the assistance profiles provide for forward planning. The AVCC also mentioned the `rolling triennial funding which enables universities to plan their activities more effectively, and supports the introduction of a single operating grant'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Higher Education Council has participated in all profile discussions, provides advice to the Government on the principles which should apply to the profiles process and related funding decisions. It also reports to the Parliament on outcomes as specified in legislation; provides an independent and balanced view of the profiles process; and, importantly, supports the profiles. </PARA>
<PARA> On the occasional calls for scrapping of education profiles, there is one final word. The Commonwealth cannot be expected to allocate $3.8 billion of taxpayers' money each year to the higher education system without some solid evidence of effective planning and accountability. To do otherwise would be plainly irresponsible. In its document, Higher Education for the 1990s, the AVCC strongly endorsed the directions taken by this Government, directions which would be well complemented by the Bill I speak to now. </PARA>
<PARA> The AVCC put on record in this publication its support for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and Higher Education Council advisory structure with this support, going as far as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The AVCC does not support the re-establishment of the former Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission or an equivalent body. </PARA>
<PARA>It also supports the role of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) in the administration of higher education programs and in consulting and negotiating directly with institutions on funding issues; the educational profile concept; rolling triennial funding; and expansion of the system to provide greater access for school leavers and mature students, particularly women. </PARA>
<PARA> The AVCC also congratulated the Government for providing substantial capital resources since 1988 and is presently working with the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council in reviewing the extent of data collected by DEET for program and accountability purposes-a fine endorsement of the Hawke Government's record in higher education in anyone's book!</PARA>
<PARA> So as the individual characteristics of each student at an institution or campus differ, so too must institutions identify their own unique qualities and needs. The statements that have been prepared by institutions to date vary widely in both coverage and content. As this method of funding is quite different from those used previously, some institutions will naturally require a degree of guidance in ensuring their education profiles address the specific needs of the target groups present in its constituency. The Department of Employment, Education and Training, as it has done to date, will play a big role in ensuring this aim is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> To better utilise resources in the education budget, the Government will seek to gain strong commitment by institutions to the national plan as well as their own institutional plans in future profile discussions. Because of the variation in needs already stated, there can be no one rule to follow for institutions when preparing their education profiles. However, the following criteria have been set as guidelines to bring a degree of consistency into the preparation of profiles: institution resources committed to equity programs and initiatives; identifying priority disadvantaged groups; equity objectives and targets; strategies for achieving objectives; and monitoring and performance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Education is one of the most important benefits we ever have to offer our children. That is why this Government has always given it such a high priority. To ensure that we become the clever country it is important that we recognise the importance of education. Australia's fate as we enter the twenty-first century depends on the education of our future generations, and through targeting our educational resources as effectively and equitably as possible--</PARA>

Like most honourable members, I wish to avoid the degenerating personal abuse that too often in moments of high drama flies across this chamber. But I have to confess to finding it sorely tempting to describe the speech by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) as trite, irrelevant and absolutely out of touch, and one which does neither he nor the constituents he seeks to represent any credit. However, it being the season of Lent, and having given up abusing Government members, I shall not go down that road.

<PARA> The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill amends the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988. That principal Act established the National Board of Employment, Education and Training-known as NBEET, believe it or not, amongst the bureaucratic jargonists of Canberra. It also established the Board's constituent councils: the Schools Council; the Australian Research Council; the Higher Education Council; and the Employment and Skills Formation Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has two functions. Firstly, it affects the various means of reporting by the Higher Education Council and, secondly, it also changes the procedures for making appointments to the various councils which constitute NBEET. The principal task of the Bill is to allow the Higher Education Council to report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training once instead of twice a year on the higher education contribution scheme and the education profiles process. As most honourable members would know-certainly you would, Mr Deputy Speaker; but I am not sure about the honourable member for Oxley-educational profiles are the central bureaucratic instrument by which the Government determines funding for the various tertiary educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the educational profiles whose effectiveness and acceptance the honourable member for Oxley testified to. The educational profiles amount to a bureaucratic form of intervention in the operations of the tertiary sector. The Government has left its footprints all through the university sector in this country-size 12 hobnailed boots, to be perfectly frank. The Government imposed a reform policy upon the tertiary sector, which has dramatically restructured higher education over the past three years since the Green Paper on higher education of December 1987. The profile requirement, which this Bill puts into effect, is an expression of that bureaucratic intrusion into the autonomy of the universities. It is an expression of the sort of bureaucratic tangles that are weaved when governments seek to take too great a control of resource allocation issues. It is an instrument ostensibly devised to provide a quantitative indicator to the bureaucracy of the qualitative differences between universities in respect of triennial funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is ludicrous in its intentions. It is a costly and time consuming encumbrance upon the universities. It has also created a highly politicised funding process. The profile is meant to be central to the funding relationship between a university and the Commonwealth. But it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are there doubts about the statistical integrity of the exercise, there are also other players in the game behind the scene. The process is essentially political. It involves weightings being given to advice from innumerable other sources from within the Department and from other external bodies. It is not merely about accountability. It is about political subservience, political orthodoxy. </PARA>
<PARA> The university community has come to realise that the profile system is nothing more than a tiresome and costly performance which must be geared to the political expectations of the Government. In an effort to create a centralised administrative mechanism for the determination of funds the Government has created an administrative and political quagmire. The Government simply needs to realise that the performance of the tertiary sector is not a function of the capacity of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to exert control over its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's report by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Priorities for Reform in Higher Education saw through the Government's reform policies. It found that the Government's preoccupation has been with the shape and the size of the tertiary sector and with the centralisation of authority within the bureaucracy. The Government had no more than a bureaucratic perspective of the role of education in society. It has not been concerned with qualitative outcomes-with performance as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly for the scientific and technological research community the gravest impact of the Government's indifference to the qualitative performance of the university system has been caused by the clawback arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, when speaking to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill before the House, I was concentrating my remarks on the educational profiles. To summarise, I am utterly convinced, as are so many within the tertiary sector, that the education profiles represent nothing more than centralised bureaucratic control. Moreover, this has become a politicised process which allows the Minister to manipulate the conduct and management of universities. Now, however, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the status of science and technological research effort within the university sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, I wish to address the clawback. We know that there has been no systematic work carried out by the Minister on the impact of the clawback arrangements from the operational budgets of the universities. The clawback provides base funding for the Australian Research Council, but it has stripped the universities of their capacity to provide the infrastructure to pursue their research efforts. The space, the services, the support personnel and the equipment have all been allowed to run down. </PARA>
<PARA> The same trend has been evident within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Dr John Stocker, Chief Executive of the CSIRO, has reported to this Parliament's Public Accounts Committee that that organisation too is suffering from the erosion of its capital base and equipment levels. This trend, particularly so in the tertiary sector, has demoralised staff. Regardless of the Government's infrastructure grants of the May 1989 science and technology statement, the university sector is cumulatively some $87m worse off because of the clawback mechanism-that is, by 1992 some $87m will have been squeezed from the research infrastructure since 1988. In 1989, the bill for the replacement of obsolete equipment alone in the university sector was running at $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is no doubt partly to blame for the massive exodus of skilled tertiary teachers and researchers from the higher education system. On recent figures, we are told that there has been an 81 per cent growth in academics leaving Australia--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And going overseas, since 1985. It is a continuation, indeed, an acceleration of the brain drain, as the honourable member for Dawson correctly points out. The best of Australia's research minds are now profoundly reluctant to remain within the research system, and the brain drain has left Australia's higher educational institutions devastated. Is it also any wonder that the interest amongst graduates in science has fallen away? This has had a powerful impact on the flow of trained science graduates returning to secondary teaching.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Graduates Careers Council's most recent report tells us that, since 1988, on the basis of those replying to its survey, the number of science graduates turning to teaching as a career has fallen from 200 to 50 in 1990. The trend is downwards and shows no sign of relenting. These are human resources which the secondary educational sector can ill afford to lose. The next generation of Australia's scientists are out there in their final years of secondary schooling. The findings of the National Institute of Labour Studies shows the depth of the crisis in academic staffing to which this will give rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Blandy report, as it is known, defined in more precise terms what has long been known: the university system-as the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee found-will need to find some 25,000 new academics by the year 2000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dawson suggests that they may well have to be imported from overseas. But there is no doubt at all that there is a great shortage looming for science graduates, particularly PhDs, overseas. Indeed, I learned from a delegation of members of the European Parliament yesterday that collectively the European Community will pour the equivalent of $A4.5 billion into science research and technology over the next couple of years. That is in addition to their existing grant. There is going to be a world shortage of the very best scientific brains. Therefore, I do not believe that Australia can hope to make up the increasing shortfall in science graduates, researchers and teachers from overseas as it has done in the past all too often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just where will the next generation of academics be found? The necessary human resources are out there in the final years of secondary school at this moment. But they are hardly inclined to pursue research and teaching careers in a physical environment which compromises their skills and constantly reminds them of the disregard with which the Government views their disciplines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What hope is there of attracting international researchers to Australia when its reputation abroad is one of a country whose research infrastructure has collapsed. This was the very problem the CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Research faced when it tried to recruit adequately trained staff for its climate research program only last year. It found it could not find the necessary number of physics graduates-those with a PhD-or the necessary numbers of computer scientists to meet the division's requirements. Even though it had been given the funding to carry out the research program, the division could not attract or recruit the necessary staff in time. It tried recruiting from overseas last year, but found the competition too tough. It tried luring back talented, qualified researchers who had left Australia in the previous few years, but they could not be lured back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia had established for itself a reputation for policy inconsistency in respect of science. It had also won a reputation, sadly, for inadequate support for infrastructure. This is a reputation which will be hard to wipe clean. When the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services seeks solutions in importing the nation's scientific resources, he might care to keep this in mind: scientific researchers are much like anybody else in respect of their desire to earn a livelihood, but what counts more for them is being able to enjoy the basic conditions in which they can pursue the research the nation expects of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a matter of wishing to be indulged by the state; it is not a matter of special pleading by an interest group; it is simply a matter of being placed in the circumstances which will allow them to meet the expectations the Government and the community have created about their work. </PARA>
<PARA> The scientific researchers are at the cutting edge of the clever country slogan. They are the ones whom the Government has exhorted to lead the nation into a more knowledge-intensive value-added industrial future. They are the ones who bear the brunt of the clever country cliche, so politically manipulated by the Government. It is the scientific and technological researchers who will realise Australia's industrial future, yet it is this group that the Government has robbed of the very conditions that will allow them to get on with the job. To be frank, the legacy of the Government's policies on the sciences will take a long time to correct. It will be a dangerous period for Australia's scientific capabilities in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> Talented though it is, Australia's pool of scientific resources is small. There are only 35,000 or so scientists and engineers working in this country. The higher education system engages about half this number. About 60 per cent of these are graduate research students. This means that the human resource base upon which the nation's scientific capabilities depend is in a fragile condition to begin with. Once we start to disaffect the current generation of researchers, once we begin to choke off the supply of interested students from the secondary school system, we irreparably damage the long term capabilities of the research base. Already, several of the core scientific disciplines within the national tertiary education system have been severely eroded. Those who are close to the scientific disciplines know full well the decline of key scientific areas of inquiry such as physics and mathematics. </PARA>
<PARA> I freely admit that the task of rebuilding the nation's research infrastructure will be a difficult one. The longer the capital base and other support facilities run down the more difficult they are to correct. But there are initiatives the Government could undertake to give the research community, especially in the tertiary sector, a renewed sense of purpose and direction. It is imperative in the circumstances that currently face the tertiary research sector that the key disciplines retain their critical mass. In selective ways, the research sector needs to utilise its existing infrastructure in prevailing expertise in more efficient ways. </PARA>
<PARA> As it stands, our research effort is too disorganised. In the past this sort of disillusion has been good, but present circumstances call for a more concentrated and better coordinated research effort. It is a matter that should be listed for the next Premiers Conference. We hear that the Government is meeting with the Premiers on a number of issues so as to coordinate and avoid duplication and unnecessary dispersal of resources. This question of greater concentration of resources in research must be considered at the next meeting. </PARA>

We are in need in this country of good tertiary institutions if industry is expected to develop in the way we need. If this country is to be turned around we must have well trained graduates to provide the basis for industry to rebuild. This Government, whilst speaking of deregulation in higher education, provides unnecessary interference in the institutions-to the extent of what subjects will be taught, what research will be carried out, and how they will manage their affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government speaks of the clever country. It speaks of technological advances. It speaks of the need for change. Yet it pursues a policy of forced amalgamations and disruption to the system of education. I am concerned when I see institutions which produce quality graduates being pushed into a corner on amalgamations. I wonder where the higher education plan is when an institution proposed to be formed, the Victorian University of Technology, cannot meet in one of its own facilities but has to meet at an outside location to facilitate a satisfactory discussion. One must ask about the level of morale of the lecturers in this institution and the problems they face in the future. One needs to ask: should their role be to concern themselves about their own futures or the education of people?</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this evening the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) tried to colour the argument by using such words as `motivating the Australian population' and `these changes are a springboard for education'. `Springboard' may be right because this Government has directed higher education one step closer to the drainpipe. While members of this Government who have an interest in higher education speak of high technology and our need to change, they fail to relate the rapid change to what they are doing in the institutions. They erode the rapid change by sticking their noses into the processes of the higher education system. It is no different from any other area of policy that this Government has got itself involved in. It seems that it is unable to help itself when it comes to sticking its nose into a portfolio area and upsetting the general flow of things. </PARA>
<PARA> Flexibility in the higher education area is essential to keep pace with the changes within our technology areas, yet this Government is trying to make the system inflexible. As the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) said, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is trying to put a straitjacket on the higher education system. In a decade when we are being told that there will be shortages of tertiary institution staff around the world, as was indicated earlier by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), when we are being told that by the year 2000 there will be a shortfall of staff in this country of 18,900, this Government and this Minister are pushing institutions down a track, by lowering staff morale, that will compound the desperate staffing level problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the results of this? In this so- called clever country-a country which must lift its levels of technology if we are to be able to compete; which must lift its levels of technology if we are to be able to retain any standards of living that will be acceptable-we have words and not actions. If we are to advance, we must see a freeing up of the system. We should allow the institutions to go out and raise their own funds. The more we allow them to raise their own funds the more relevant the higher education institutions are likely to be to the needs of industry and the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not need bureaucracy to determine the direction of higher education, but a link between those who need the graduates and those who provide them. The clever country will not occur unless we have that link. This Minister and this Government need to realise that the words `clever country' are not sufficient on their own to improve tertiary education. They will not be sufficient to keep pace with the levels of advances in technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) mentioned that over the past few years the Government has increased its expenditure on research by 200 per cent. That is well and good, but if we had industry and institutions working together we would see research funding being spent more efficiently because industry would be contributing. I am not saying that research funding at the moment is being wasted. I am saying that in a country where we are talking about productivity increases, if we involve industry and private enterprise we will see productivity increases from what is achieved in research areas. I hope that the Minister and this Government will recognise the shortcomings of the direction they are taking and that they will make the changes necessary to bring about the clever country we all want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to debate the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill because I believe it is essential that the people of Australia are made aware of how this Labor Government controls, manipulates and interferes in the direction of tertiary courses through funding constraints on institutions in Australia. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, in his second reading speech, said among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Educational profiles are a mechanism designed to balance the freedom of institutions to manage their own affairs with a need for public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be the first to advocate public accountability where public moneys are expended, but I ask: do we really have public accountability? There is no doubt that is public money; taxpayers' funds are being used to provide the wherewithal for tertiary institutions to operate. I question, though, whether the control through education profiles is actually the appropriate method for public accountability and, in particular, whether we are providing a better education as a result of this mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it intriguing that the Minister used almost identical words in his second reading speech in support of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990, where he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to . . . protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is strange, is it not, that this interventionist, centralised Government and interventionist Minister should seek through legislation to protect the independence of higher education institutions from government interference? It is ironic, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA> The real purpose of this Bill is to change the reporting requirements of the Higher Education Council and to ensure monitoring of the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) and reporting on it. The public accountability element is put forward because this Government funds the institution rather than the individual. Funding the institution gives rise to significant differences in cost benefit, that is, cost per student. The cost is extremely high per client in those institutions with a smaller client base than in those institutions with many clients and consequent lower costs per client. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidently this whole process, according to the Minister's speech, is that the profiles represent agreements negotiated annually between the Commonwealth and higher education institutions which define an institution's broad mission, together with its teaching and research responsibilities, and establish its particular areas of activity and specified goals as the basis on which institutions receive Commonwealth funding. That is a mouthful, is it not? It is also frightening. </PARA>
<PARA> Does this mean that the Commonwealth or the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), or the Minister or some other body or board-maybe the Higher Education Council or the National Board of Employment, Education and Training or somebody in this huge bureaucratic circus-says that each particular tertiary institution must establish the type of curriculum it will teach and specify the sorts of achievements that it wants before it gets Commonwealth funding? It really reads to me a bit like the fox designing the henhouse. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of the fox and the henhouse, I note for the interest of the House that last week the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) launched the national project on the quality of teaching and learning. This is a doozey of a bureaucratic exercise. It is an additional board to `find ways of improving the status of teaching as a profession and enhancing the quality of teaching in the classroom'. That sounds pretty admirable, but I have to inform the House that the Board is made up of 24 members-12 from the educational bureaucracy and 12 from the teacher unions. Is that not terrific? That is the fox and the hen house syndrome for sure. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 10 years, the status of teachers in our country has fallen considerably. This is directly attributable to the unhealthy influence, in my opinion, of the more militant left wing unionists within the teaching profession. Parents generally see teacher unions in control of the education agenda and being concerned more with teacher rights and conditions than with the quality of education and the quality of outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we desperately need a more qualified and respected teaching force, but in order to get such a force, we must reduce the size of our smothering bureaucracy, devolve standards to the community and reduce the power and influence of the teacher unions, which will allow teachers to be evaluated on merit and remunerated appropriately. In essence, this means that we are going to get better teachers and hopefully they will be better respected by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than some bureaucratic board in Canberra isolated from the community and the public deciding what will be taught and how it will be taught, perhaps the students, in consultation with their parents-who basically fund the school-ought to decide what the hell they want. If an institution has lax standards and lax grading procedures and there is no final reliable assessment, employers and businesses will ultimately determine to reject the outputs of that institution. That is just like business, is it not? If the product is no good, if the quality is poor; if nobody really wants the product in the first place, nobody is going to buy it and the business fails. </PARA>
<PARA> So as employers begin to say that they do not like what institutions are doing because they are not happy with the quality of their outputs, the parents and students will say that they do not want to go to institution X because the reputation of institution Y is better in terms of employment prospects. Institution X then will either fail or pull its socks up and come back into mainstream education Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So in essence what is needed is the creation of institutions of excellence. Does the Minister hear that-institutions of excellence. The better reputation an institution achieves through producing effective outcomes-having standards of excellence rather than letting the students through easily-the more students that institution will attract. That is more readily achievable when funds are made available via the students to the institution rather than straight to the institution, where there is far too much capacity to water down the contribution dollars so that the end value is much less than the commencement value and consequently a poorer quality of outcome is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) earlier in this debate said that we must have affirmative action in education. I agree with that; I think that that is absolutely terrific. We should have affirmative action in education. Let the people of this country come to this institutionalised Government and tell it what they think of its messing around with our high quality institutions of higher learning. Let the people tell the Government. I tell you what, the people are not very happy with the Government, not at all. The institutions are not happy with the Government; the professors are not happy with the Government and the students are not happy with the Government. So, for heaven's sake, yes, let us have some affirmative action. I agree with all that; it is terrific stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lilley said that we need equity, access and expansion. To the best of my knowledge, we have always had equity-the availability of tertiary education to those who come from lower income backgrounds, from lower socioeconomic groups, from the disadvantaged. Those people represent the same proportion of the student population today as they represented 20 years ago. So perhaps there is a point there for the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lilley also talked about the administrative complexity of the system today. For heaven's sake, she got that right-there is no fear about that. By golly, the system is complex. There are so many boards and bureaucratic organisations now involved in primary, secondary and tertiary education in this country that they absolutely smother the institutions themselves as well as the teachers and professors who ought to be getting on with the job of giving our young people a high quality education. The Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The higher education contribution scheme . . . requires students and graduates to make contribution towards some of the costs of the provision of their studies. At the time of the scheme's inception, a provision was inserted . . . requiring the Higher Education Council . . . to report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, and thence to the Minister and Parliament, on the operation of the scheme and its effects on access to higher education, and the level and quality of postgraduate research. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know who is to determine the level and quality of postgraduate research or whether the Minister is competent to make such a determination, but I would have thought that the Higher Education Council, in considering the operation of the HEC scheme, would not have any particular competency to determine the level and quality of postgraduate research. How does the perceived quality of postgraduate research relate to the payments by students for the opportunity to attend university? I am loath to understand and I hope that in his reply the Minister will advise me. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no particular opposition to the Council reporting once each year. Our general thrust would be towards reducing substantially the massive bureaucracy of DEET and its satellites, which appears to be particularly over-balanced when we look at the few universities that we have in Australia. Additionally, the recent and substantive fight between the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and all of the higher education institutions, when they were forced to rationalise, has really achieved nothing. It has forced some totally irrational mergers between smaller, high quality institutions and larger, more broadly-based universities and in some cases it has gobbled up councils of adult education, thus reducing their ability to work with and relate to their local communities. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see how all of this rationalisation and merging, forced by the Minister through withholding funds, has achieved any bureaucratic savings in dollar terms in operating institutions. We would like to compare such savings with the cost of running DEET. Perhaps the Minister could provide us with that information. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) in his contribution said that when this Australian Labor Party Government came into power the education services were rather uncoordinated. My goodness, they are not particularly coordinated now, but how much larger is the bureaucracy today when compared with the number of students and the size of the bureaucracy in 1983? I would like to know that. In fact, I intend to place a question on notice to get the absolute cost of operating DEET and all of the boards and councils. I would like to know the true administrative cost to this Government and to the people of this country for all of these programs and investigations and all of this interaction, communication and talking which, apparently, has resolved nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a growth industry all right, and certainly it has done nothing towards increasing the quality of output. The Minister in his second reading speech said that the Council need only report once each year on the impact of the higher education contribution scheme. I ask the Minister whether he is aware of what impact HECS has had on student numbers? It is my understanding that the scheme has had no impact whatsoever in terms of a reduction in inputs to universities. I note that more students than ever are applying to attend university, and I congratulate the Minister on that. But more than ever are also being knocked back, and I do not congratulate the Minister on that. Has the HEC scheme had any impact, other than costing some people more money? Perhaps we are simply distributing more evenly the cost of education to those who have benefited. Is that reasonable?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am supportive of the basic idea of students contributing to the cost of their tertiary education. In fact, I think it is probably time that we moved more towards a general system of fees and charges for university students, but coupled with a more comprehensive and varied method of student financial assistance, which means that those students who are more financially capable do pay for their own education. We must remember that tertiary graduates are very probably going to earn more money as a result of their qualifications. Through the system of Austudy or its equivalent, student loans, students working in private industry and a system of academic scholarships, we should be able to cater for those students of academic quality who are financially unable to support themselves in university. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow Minister for education, because I believe that this Labor Government is responsible for the absolute mismanagement of higher education in our country. This Labor Government, which is led by Rhodes Scholar Hawke, is very good at talking about consultation with the community and about how Australia needs to become the clever country-and I note that all of my colleagues have discussed the clever country syndrome. Yet this Government has presided over the decline of many of our nation's leading academic institutions. The value of a bachelor of education in science from Melbourne University has been downgraded when it is considered that the intake cut-off score in 1991 is a paltry 250. Shame, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The forced amalgamation situation in Victoria is an unmitigated disaster. Institution after institution is fighting. The press is full every week-almost every day-of the battles between the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the others, and between Deakin University and its satellites, but nobody can agree. Nobody really wanted to amalgamate in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of La Trobe, in the south-eastern portion of the outer metropolitan area of Melbourne, we want another university. A group of us have formed a council which is speaking to the people in the community, the press, academics and local councillors, and we are saying to the Labor Government in Victoria, `We need an institution. We can provide you with rail access to a site and we can get bus access to the site. We can no longer afford, in this high growth area, to send our students 20 or 30 miles away to go to university. We want the same situation that New South Wales has; we want another university'. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, while this Bill is a fairly insignificant housekeeping measure I hope that both Ministers with responsibility in this portfolio will take note of the number of speakers in this debate and accept that number as an indication of the concern on this side of the House regarding the state of ineptitude abounding in the educational bureaucracy under the direction of this interventionist, centralist Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, in one sense this Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill could not be called a major piece of Government legislation, but in another sense it can be seen as a very clear indication of the way the Hawke Administration continues to meddle in the handling of very important aspects of Australian life. Ever since the Commonwealth chose to become involved in the provision of funds for education, there has been a steady and unrelenting intrusion into the running of various institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As can be seen from this amending Bill, and from the speech of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), the Government is now very heavily involved in the machinery of tertiary education in every State. It seems to me that the Government's stated intention is to have institutions free to manage their own affairs, but the reality is starkly otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding provision is called public accountability, which is another way of saying `accountable to the Minister' or, in other words, accountable to the ideology of the Labor Party. Institutions which do not toe the line will be said to have failed the accountability test and will, therefore, not be funded. If proof is needed of this, I would refer the House to the recent series of forced amalgamations of the various institutions within Victoria and the way in which the Minister tried to dictate the game plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bendigo College of Advanced Education (BCAE) was forced to amalgamate with the La Trobe University, and consideration of important aspects of funding of both institutions was delayed until the merger arrangements were completed. I am pleased to be following the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who, with me, visited the Latrobe University and heard the problems of that university, which are similar to those of the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> With the financial weapon not even disguised, the Minister forced the Bendigo College to amalgamate under conditions which it would not have chosen under normal circumstances. Tough negotiations by the council of the BCAE gave it certain autonomy in some areas, but only after really putting enormous pressure on the two institutions and on the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to dwell on the Bendigo College, its proud history and its likely future. Tertiary education in Bendigo dates back to the very earliest days of the gold rushes, back to the 1850s. A meeting of enterprising people decided there was a very real need for the training of people in various ways. Initially there was a mechanics' institute and a free library, a sort of teach yourself idea, but before long came the formation of the Bendigo School of Mines and Industries, which quickly developed into a leader in the training of various skills which were needed in the technology of deep mining. It would be of interest to the House to know that in the latter part of the last century, Bendigo led the world in the development of deep mining technology, and much of that success was due to the excellence of the training for engineers, metallurgists and chemists received at the Bendigo School of Mines. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these were the days before Federation. The extraordinary thing is that all this was achieved without the interference of Canberra and centralised control. Today the Minister and his Government, more than ever before, subscribe to the view that absolutely nothing in this country is possible without direct and unremitting involvement from the national capital. I am telling the Minister that it is time to have a rethink, and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is at the table for this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> But back to the Bendigo School of Mines. Like all tertiary bodies, the Bendigo School of Mines was responsive to change. It moved on. It changed its name and it changed its courses. Over the years it became the Bendigo Technical College, the Bendigo Institute of Technology, the Bendigo College of Advanced Education, and it is now the University College of Northern Victoria, linked to the La Trobe University. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Bendigo College has record enrolments-over 4,500 students-and because of the way this Government is handling, or I should say mishandling the administration, it finds itself short of the funds needed to provide for all of those students. Appeals by the college to the Government have fallen on deaf ears. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services claims he cannot even consider any action until the Victorian Minister, Mr Pullen, advises him that all of the amalgamations are in place. It is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is very acute. With record enrolments you have to have record numbers of places. That means buildings, facilities and staff. Perhaps the Minister thinks the college should refuse those enrolments. I have gained the impression from the way the Government has been advertising on television, urging people to further their studies and enrol for Austudy, that it at least would be anticipating enrolments and making some provision for them, but such is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Take Bendigo, for example. The deliberate withholding of funds to force amalgamation has resulted in no allocation for the badly needed business and computing building. This particular building was needed irrespective of the merger with the La Trobe University, and there is a very real suspicion-very real-that the withholding of money for this project was part of a very deliberate and cynical political ploy by the Minister. It is my suspicion that whilst money was withheld from Bendigo to force it to the negotiating table with La Trobe, that same parcel of money was being held out as a carrot to encourage amalgamation of institutions in the western suburbs of Melbourne. I believe that similar claims might be made by other country institutions in Victoria as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director of the Bendigo College, Dr John Webster, has publicly claimed that the college was expecting an allocation of over $5m for the building. That was for the first stage which was to be started this year. But these hopes have evaporated due to the Minister's attitude. The Minister refuses to consider Bendigo's capital funding requirements, and it seems ironic to me that the only institution to receive details of its capital works funding is the new Victoria Institute of Technology, which is a proposed amalgamation of the Footscray Institute and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), right in the Labor heartland of Melbourne. Of course, that was before today's current Morgan Gallup Poll which indicates that the Labor Party would not win one seat-not one seat-in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all part of his area. So much for the unbiased approach to education in Victoria. One might say, `Why not put it to the Minister direct?'. I tried that. I tried putting it to the Minister. I wrote to the Minister last December pointing out the concerns of the Bendigo College and, perhaps whilst not writing exclusively in words of one syllable, I did try to put Bendigo's case fairly and clearly to the Minister. In my letter I said I was concerned at the failure of the Government to allocate funds to the college, and asked that he address the question to ensure that access to higher education is available to people in country Victoria, and that funds will not be diverted to encourage metropolitan amalgamations. Back came a letter in the last week of February. It was not, as one would hope, a reply from the Minister, but rather from a senior adviser, in which it was said that the Minister's hands were tied, tied because the Victorian Minister, Mr Pullen, was not ready to act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my long experience as a member of the Victorian Parliament I cannot ever remember a time when a Victorian Minister exercised such power and control over a Minister from Canberra. I am sure there are other honourable members of this House with similar experience who could report along the same lines. After all, as the Commonwealth has pointed out from time to time-and it does so repeatedly-it has the power of the purse and, as we all know, it has used that power to force its will whenever and wherever it chooses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is reluctant, even unable, to do anything to approve funds because the Victorian Minister has to say so first. The Minister has to get down on his hands and knees and plead with the Victorian Minister to let these amalgamations take place. What rot! Either the Minister accepts his role as dictator to the States and allocates the money, or vacates the field altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> In the letter, the adviser says that the Minister does intend to make a supplementary statement as soon as the State has provided advice which is acceptable to both the institutions and the Commonwealth. Talk about having someone to do one's own dirty work! Poor old Barry Pullen, the Victorian Minister for Education, has to do all the negotiating and be able, so it seems, to read the mind of the Federal Minister into the bargain. Only then will our Minister condescend to distribute his largess. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt with an important area which is in my electorate. But it is only one of many areas of education within my electorate, within the State of Victoria and within the whole of Australia, which is being frustrated by the incompetence of this Government. There surely needs to be an overall appreciation of the needs of educating Australians and that is a proper role of the Commonwealth, but such a responsibility does not mean that the day to day control has to be centralised in Canberra. That is where this Government is making a massive mistake. My experience tells me that in most things centralised control by Canberra means added cost, extra delays, more in-fighting-and we have seen plenty of that-less decision making and, in the end, frustration of the very objectives that we are trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> A line will have to be drawn somewhere and at some time. It seems to me that this is probably a good place and a good time. The temptation would be to throw out the Bill. In so doing we would be doing the Minister a favour, and I am sure Barry Pullen in Victoria could do without the interference from Canberra from time to time. Besides, the Minister acknowledges that it is really Mr Pullen, the State Minister, who holds the real power; he has control of the situation. Perhaps I have read it all wrong, but I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government should be getting out of the detailed involvement in all the areas which are better handled at State or maybe even local government level. Let this be one of the turning points in the achievement of greater efficiency in the government of this nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise tonight to address the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1991 now before us. I am very happy to follow the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) because in my speech tonight I will refer to some work done by the College of Advanced Education in Bendigo last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to see the interest that is being shown by this side of the House. When we look at the Government benches we see that, save for the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Baldwin), there is no-one here. That highlights the way that this Government has treated education-with no interest. In fact, I think the Minister is only doing his duty; otherwise, perhaps he would not be here either. It clearly the demonstrates the position of this Government and its interest in education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly known that the value of education facilities and educators cannot be underestimated in this day and age. Clearly, a strong education system will increase economic performance and competitiveness and place our nation in a much better and more favourable situation in the twenty-first century. Yet this Government has placed a very low priority on education-a much lower priority than that of the coalition when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote some figures because the comparison is testimony to what I have said. In 1980-81 the contribution of the coalition Government to education in Australia was 8.1 per cent of total Budget outlays-in other words, 2.24 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1989 under this Labor Government, the expenditure was reduced to 7.75 per cent-a real reduction in Budget outlays to 1.78 per cent of GDP. Funding is falling away. Higher education has been given the same treatment as the economy by this Government. Although we have had substantial increases in student numbers, this unmet demand has not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the 1980-81 figures, one sees that expenditure was 4.6 per cent of Budget outlays. In comparison, today's expenditure figure is 3.5 per cent of Budget outlays. Irrespective of whichever figures are pulled out of the Budget, we find that we are worse off today than we were when we had a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> This country will not become a brilliant or clever country, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would like it to be. We would all like to see us become better educated or brilliant, if you like. I do not like the word `brilliant' or the term `clever country', but if we want that, we have to see significant increases in funding for education. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the erosions in funding for education has been academic salaries relative to average weekly earnings over the past 20 years. It illustrates a real decline in the community's perception of the profession. What has crept in has been an acceptance of mediocrity over excellence, which is a prescription for continued economic decline. As a result of that we have seen some substandard teaching practices. Academics have become more interested in publishing papers than learning how to communicate ideas. In other words, there is no proviso in the system to teach people how to teach. Teachers are moving up the academic ladder by publishing papers rather than advancing through the quality of their teaching. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the higher education contribution scheme is a good thing. However, as students contribute to higher education they should demand better. They are now funding some of their education and they deserve better. If better service and education is to be given, we really must start with the basics. The equality of opportunity for every Australian student has been lowered. As students contribute they should demand better and I am surprised that they have not been more outspoken. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another area of equality of opportunity and that is the area of rural and remote Australia. In looking at the work done by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) in 1988 and the participation rates for higher education students from rural and remote areas of Australia, one will see that these just do not compare with the participation rate of the people living in urban Australia. Urban Australia includes the capital cities and there is an awful lot of country outside them which is rural, remote and very much inland. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures show that 75 per cent of Australia's higher education students come from urban backgrounds, 19 per cent from rural areas, and only 3 per cent from the largest areas geographically-the remote regions of Australia. This situation reflects the incapacity of remote families to cope with the financial burdens associated with higher education. It is set to worsen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at the figures that came out of the Outlook Conference of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics this year to see that the drop in farm incomes is estimated at 57 per cent for the coming 12 months. The survey taken over the past few weeks by National Farmers Federation paints an even worse picture-87 per cent. That figure is really only reflecting the rapid decline that this nation is experiencing. Looking at the debt level of the average farmer, 74 per cent owe right now more than a quarter of a million dollars-that is, $225,000. This will not only affect those people on the land with an asset that is now virtually unsaleable, it will also affect the rural towns, the provincial cities. </PARA>

The money to drive the economies of those towns is not going to be generated. It is estimated that $5 billion less will circulate in those towns as a result of the downturn in commodity prices that is facing rural producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, the DEET statistics show that in 1989 students from rural and remote backgrounds had a similar age distribution, with the largest proportion being under 20. On the other hand, the figures for urban students showed a different pattern, with the largest proportion being in their 20s. Therefore it can be substantiated that students from urban backgrounds find it much easier and more affordable to go on to higher education than those living in areas that are geographically isolated. It should be the responsibility of any government-not just this Government-to remove the barriers to equality of education. I believe that the DEET figures substantiate my argument. There really is an inequity in rural and remote Australia as opposed to the urban population. </PARA>
<PARA> Centres for higher education should not be directed solely to the urban student at the expense of the rural student. To that end, I believe that Austudy should undergo a comprehensive overhaul to ensure that such imbalances are addressed. I referred earlier to the work done by the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. It made an extensive study of the problems and inequities associated with rural and remote Australia. Its recommendation was to abolish the assets test for small business and for farms. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of assistance for isolated children is one of the problems confronting people in rural and remote Australia right now. Some are not sending their children away for higher education because they can ill afford to. When the coalition was in government the principle adopted was that assistance for isolated students was based on 55 per cent of average boarding costs right across Australia. That figure has now dropped to less than 30 per cent. If 55 per cent was good enough as a measure for assistance when the scheme was introduced, we should stick to the principle and take the politics out of that base assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing forms of education assistance, it becomes pertinent to look at government arrangements which commenced in 1991 to award students prizes. There are 500 prizes to be awarded, each valued at $2,000, for outstanding achievement in year 12. At face value, I thought that was a very good thing, but when we go a little further we find that this arrangement does not direct the money wisely at all. These awards, which will total $1m, relate to past studies and carry no obligation to undertake further study. Furthermore, if these students were to go on, these prizes would not be regarded as income for Austudy or personal income tax purposes. It is really the dead wood prize. What is the investment of that $1m of taxpayers' money contributing to their future education? They are purely prizes. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, a bursary-and in many cases bursaries are awarded by private companies and institutions-is defined as a form of education assistance pledged to a student by an industry or organisation and is taken into account for the purposes of assets tests and personal income tests. So on the one hand there are 500 prizes to be awarded in the coming 12 months. It will cost $1m but there will be no obligation. On the other hand, institutions offer bursaries which are considered as personal income and are taken into consideration for Austudy purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement does not encourage people to apply for bursaries and does not encourage private enterprise to become involved in education and to take some of the load off governments. I believe that bursaries are very good ways of encouraging private enterprise to get involved in training and education. However, it is a crazy situation when the Government gives out prizes that carry no obligation, are not taxed and do not affect Austudy, and yet a bursary is taxed and affects a student's eligibility for Austudy. I ask the Minister to look at that area and correct the inequalities that exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Further testimony to the imbalance between rural and urban students is the fact that at the postgraduate level there is a higher proportion of students from urban areas than from rural and remote regions. The enrolment figures show that 16 per cent of enrolments came from urban Australia while 12 per cent came from rural Australia. This adds further weight to my argument and highlights the need to provide incentive and genuine assistance for students living away from accessible education resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The unmet demand is evidenced by enrolments versus acceptances, and the situation is worsening. The current unmet demand is estimated at between 13,500 and 20,000 places per year. The number of new places funded by government has been steadily decreasing since 1989. In 1989 the figure was 6,500, and it is falling steadily. It is estimated that by 1993 the figure will be 3,000 new places to meet the unmet demand. While demand is rising, and that is evidenced by enrolments, funded places are decreasing. Unless we address this very serious imbalance, we are not going to have the clever country that we have all talked of and the Prime Minister longs for. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, whilst this is only a housekeeping Bill-as are many of the Bills that come into this House; they do not address the issues-I support the amendments put forward by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The Prime Minister points to the need for Australia to become clever, but there will be no cleverness without a first class education system. There can be no first class education system without appropriate government funding. To become a clever country, we need clever politicians to initiate clever policies. In this Government we have neither. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill makes a number of minor changes to the reporting requirements of the Higher Education Council and to provisions relating to the appointment of council and board members under the Employment, Education and Training Act. The changed reporting requirements relate to the operation of educational profiles and the higher education contribution scheme or, as it is well known, the graduate tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The educational profiles are one of the principal means by which the Government has sought to subordinate higher education to the dictates of the Government at the expense of institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Educational profiles are the formal basis on which higher educational institutions receive funding from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) referred in his second reading speech to this funding as being the product of annual negotiations and agreement, we are all too well aware that any such negotiations are inevitably one-sided affairs. The Commonwealth effectively holds all the purse strings, leaving the higher educational institutions of this country exceedingly vulnerable to any demand the Government might care to make of them. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) publication Higher Education Funding for the 1991-93 Triennium, institutions must provide extensive documentation outlining their `actual and projected teaching activities, proposals for capital projects . . . a research management plan, and data on resources directed to research' as the basis for their profiles. This information becomes the starting point in the negotiations in the corporatist consultative process which allocates Commonwealth funds to each institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this arrangement there is an obvious incentive to institutions to tailor their activities to conform to the well known prejudices of the Minister and the Commonwealth bureaucracy in order to obtain the best possible funding deal from the Government. Indeed, because each institution is potentially in competition with all the others for scarce Commonwealth funds, universities are forced into competing with each other in terms of their fidelity to Government objectives under the unified national system. This is the Government's version of competition in higher education-an auction for Government favours and patronage, with the highest levels of funding going to the most subservient institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing at all subtle about this process. An appendix to the previously mentioned DEET publication shows the teaching profile for the 1991-93 triennium which institutions are required to complete as part of the educational profile process. On this form a number of disciplinary areas are listed and the institutions are required to give details as to the courses they offer in each of them. Under the Government's new funding arrangements, different funding weights are to be accorded to courses in different disciplinary groupings according to the deemed relative cost of the courses in each group. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject breakdown for each discipline on the approved form for educational profiles effectively tells the university exactly what the Minister wants from the higher education institutions at any given time. For example, now there is provision for each institution to provide information on over 11 different types of engineering courses. In contrast, there are only three categories provided for the arts, humanities and social sciences. Of these three categories, only one constitutes a specific category of subjects, namely, Asian languages. </PARA>
<PARA> Universities are also required to indicate the courses they provide in designated national priority areas such as computer science, engineering, accounting and Asian studies. Thus it is not hard for the institution to guess, if it has not already gathered sufficient prompting from the Minister's public statements, what sort of emphasis the Commonwealth wants from the universities in terms of the fields of study to be offered by each institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is part victim and part creator of a cargo cult mentality which holds that we need only turn out sufficient numbers of appropriately skilled people, the current fad being for engineers and those who have studied Asian languages, in order that Australia might rise above the structural problems that beset the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Government has followed the Opposition in repudiating many attempts at planning the economy, the portfolio Minister persists with a belief in long term labour market planning, which is as thoroughly discredited as any other form of government intervention. Nothing could be more disastrous for the future of the Australian economy than for our universities to turn out graduates who are the product of government manipulation of the supply of tertiary places rather than of a perception by students of the future earnings to be had through the choice of a particular form of training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> While individual students are just as likely as governments to misjudge the future demand for various types of occupational and professional skills, the consequences of any one individual doing so are far less serious than if we make those mistakes collectively as a nation. This is one of the reasons we need to move towards a funding system where the supply of tertiary places is determined by the demand for them, and not the other way around, as is presently the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Coalition policy makes a decisive move in this direction by providing funding to individual students through scholarships rather than through a centralised bureaucracy. That way, students create their own places instead of being locked out of particular courses, and possibly out of higher education altogether, through arbitrary quotas. If the underlying rationale for educational profiles is misguided, then the process of compiling these profiles and monitoring academic performance is even more flawed from the point of view of individual academics working in our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> As is typical with bureaucratic edicts, the Government and the Department show little or no sensitivity to the nature of what they seek to regulate. Under the educational profiles process academics are being required by the Commonwealth bureaucracy to complete extensive documentation which asks them to provide large amounts of information about their professional activities. The relevance of much of this information to higher education policy making is highly questionable, with the possible exception of the bureaucratic model of policy making instituted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of time spent on research as opposed to teaching is one such question being asked of academics by the Commonwealth bureaucracy. Again the Government's views in this area are well known, with the Minister's quislings such as Don Aitkin attacking the value of research and suggesting that universities be given over almost wholly to teaching-a view which has frightening implications for the growth of knowledge, which is what universities should be all about. </PARA>
<PARA> As many academics have pointed out, the questions asked of them in compiling the educational profile for their institution often bear no relation to their own conception of what they do and are of dubious value as a measure of their performance for award purposes. In many disciplines, for example, it is difficult to draw a distinction between teaching and research. Indeed, it could even be considered desirable that both occur simultaneously, rather than being treated as distinct enterprises, as is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, the logical methodological propriety of the educational profiles process may be irrelevant to what the Government is trying to achieve. The principal objective of the profiles process is achieved by simply making the institutions aware of the preferences of the Canberra bureaucracy and thereby cajoling them into conformity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his second reading speech, spoke of balancing `the freedom of institutions to manage their own affairs with the need for public accountability'. But the educational profiles process would appear to achieve none of this. Whatever freedom universities might exercise in terms of setting teaching and research priorities is inevitably tempered by a Commonwealth bureaucracy which has made no secret of its designs for the higher education sector and has given every indication of seeking to reward compliant institutions via its control over funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This is true not only of the teaching and research priorities of each institution but also applies to many other issues, such as mergers, where the Government has made some very explicit threats to cut off funding where institutions have refused to comply with government plans. It is impossible to identify any gain in public accountability through this process. This is because, for the Minister, public accountability is synonymous with bureaucratic control. Of course, bureaucracies have historically never been prominent among the promoters of accountability, and we should not expect the DEET bureaucracy to be any different. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder then that Professor Stephen Knight, in his book The Selling of the Australian Mind, is able to refer to one academic as having said that she had not expected to see a truly Marxist policy come out of the Hawke Government until she read the Government's White Paper on higher education. Similarly, Professor David Flint, the Convenor of Australian Law Deans, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is ridiculous for the bureaucrats in Canberra to try to pick winners . . . That is what the present system involves-it is a command economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The educational profiles process has been widely condemned by the academic community. Many academics treat it as a joke; returning their forms with a bare minimum of information such as a list of their publications for the year-a complete waste of time for all concerned. The coalition is accordingly committed to abolishing the educational profiles process and restoring peer review and financial autonomy to their rightful place in the scheme of things.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to those provisions concerned with appointments of board and council members, it is difficult to conceive of a government body that better represents the corporatist tendencies of this Government, and the portfolio Minister, than the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its subsidiary councils. The membership of these bodies reads like a Who's Who of the corporate state in Australia. The National Board includes as members such noted educational figures as Laurie Carmichael for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Julian Disney for the Australian Council of Social Service and Bryan Noakes of the Confederation of Australian Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Higher Education Council does little better and includes-heaven forbid-representation by the National Union of Students (NUS). The representation afforded to the NUS on the Higher Education Council is a particularly odious corruption of the idea of representation-a corruption that is typical of corporatist arrangements. The National Union of Students cannot be considered representative of any tertiary students, given the simple fact that it has no membership as the word `membership' is properly understood. Students do not individually become members of the NUS. They could not join on their own initiative, even in the unlikely event that they wanted to. Students become notional members of the NUS by means of their enforced membership of campus student unions. These unions then affiliate to the NUS by means of campus-based affiliation referenda. It only takes a majority vote of the minority of students who turn out for these referenda for every student on a particular campus to be deemed a member of the National Union of Students and be forced to pay a fee for the privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Government understands by representation in connection with higher education policy; it is pure corporatism. It allows the Government to claim to have consulted with a so-called representative group without really having consulted with anyone other than the on-campus equivalent of the Australian Labor Party, the National Organisation of Labor Students. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the NUS assists the Government in maintaining the charade of representation and consultation in return for the sitting fees and trips to Canberra which enable Labor students to credential themselves for the purposes of their various career paths. To say that this is an insult to the students who are forced to foot the bill for this process through compulsory student union fees is an understatement. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, the students concerned have no proper role in the formulation of higher education policy-as empty of content as that role may be-given that their only qualifications for doing so is the ability to out-politic their fellow students. These considerations are not only applicable to the National Union of Students, but the NUS is perhaps the most flagrant example of corporatism run amuck in the conduct of higher education policy in Australia today. So when the Minister makes statements that the Higher Education Council is very positive about the state of the profiles negotiations, we are compelled to take them with a grain of salt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Minister regularly invokes the authority of this body and claims it to be `highly representative' of the higher education community. What this shows us is that the Government can only generate support for its policies by establishing sham bodies and sham consultative processes to cover up what the academic community thinks about what this Government is doing. Higher education policy has indeed been appallingly mismanaged under this Government. It is typical of the arrogance of the Government, and of the portfolio Minister, that they persist in the belief that they know best, regardless of the protestations of the bulk of the higher education community. The Government has put in place mechanisms that are designed to destroy the independence and autonomy of higher institutions, and their academics, in the name of a cargo cult of national salvation via State intervention in the labour market that will inevitably be exposed as having served Australia very poorly indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had not been my intention to speak in this debate this evening on the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill, but as has occurred on other occasions I have been inspired by the contributions of those opposite to make some statements on the record in an effort to correct some of the very misleading and quite false views that have been put forward in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commence by making some reference to the detail of what is proposed in the legislation, which is a fairly novel approach to the debate on this topic this evening. I am particularly pleased to see that in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill some provision has been made for funding allocations within Queensland that will be of benefit to those students studying in art and design courses. The Bill provides for some $4.7m to be transferred from the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1987 to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1988 to enable higher education art and design courses in Queensland, currently located within the technical and further education (TAFE) sector, to be transferred to the higher education institutions. That is a move that I support. I think there are a number of areas of study within the TAFE sector which could properly and most likely be better done in other higher education institutions. I think the Government has taken a sensible decision, and it is in line with improving the academic rigour of those courses that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has circulated two amendments to the legislation, and it is worth making some reference to those as well. The amendment circulated to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill goes to matters of great importance, and it says something of the level of the Opposition's debate that it proposes as its only alteration to that legislation amending the time in which reports have to be tabled from 15 days to five sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to ask honourable members to consider the motivation and the reasoning behind that because, quite frankly, it is nonsense. That 10 days difference will make absolutely no difference whatsoever to either the functioning of the bodies reporting to this place or the opportunity of this Parliament to have a say in the operations of the tertiary sector. I was rather bewildered, in fact, to see that amendment, and I have yet to hear any argument whatsoever from the Opposition as to why it has even bothered to waste our time with an amendment of that sort. It is a nonsensical amendment which, in any event, would create very difficult practical problems in its implementation. To actually have those documents prepared and here within five sitting days would not be an easy task administratively, even if there were compelling reasons-and in fact there are no compelling reasons. Certainly no good reasons have been advanced by any member of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment does not really deal with the legislation at all. It is more a philosophical diatribe of the sort we have come to expect from the new look Right that now has taken its place on the Opposition benches in this Parliament. We have heard in the debate tonight a good deal said about funding. Some of the honourable members on the other side of the House have gone so far as to criticise the Government for a lack of funding and have sought additional funding. Given the record of the former Liberal-National Party Government and given the current policies of the Opposition, it is in fact the height of arrogance and duplicity for those opposite to come into this place and attack this Government for not providing adequate funds to the tertiary sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just have a look at the facts. Enough of the rhetoric and the philosophical diatribe from the other side; let us look at what has actually happened in the tertiary sector as a result of this Government's initiatives. Between 1989 and 1993, under the proposals already approved by this Government, there will be an additional 70,000 places for Australian students in higher education in this country. Over 15,000 of those places were created last year, in 1990, and a further 15,000 of those places will be created this year, in 1991. That is not hollow rhetoric; that is a performance, an achievement of this Government, in recognition of the commitment which it has given to education generally and to higher education specifically. </PARA>
<PARA> My own State of Queensland has in fact suffered at the hands of successive Federal governments in addressing the particular needs of Queensland for tertiary places. This Government has recognised that problem and has set about providing additional places for Queensland students in tertiary institutions in my own State. No other government before this Government has embarked upon a program of expansion of tertiary places anything like that which we are now witnessing, funded by this Government at a time when those opposite have criticised the Budget allocations. I want to say something about the hypocrisy of that shortly. Funding generally for the tertiary sector has been increased quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the triennial plan, in 1993 the Government will be providing $3.9 billion for higher education. That represents a real increase of over 25 per cent on 1988 levels. That is a major commitment in real terms to funding tertiary education; and yet those opposite have had the gall this evening to hop up and complain about the lack of funding when their own abysmal record shows that they give education second class priority and retain it for those privileged and wealthy enough to gain access to it. That is a policy that they will return to. In fact, one wonders whether or not next week we will not have the shadow spokesperson for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), or the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) visiting upon us a new policy of vouchers for tertiary education much akin to the vouchers for secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA> So in the area of funding, it is clear that this Government has provided assistance to expand the operations of the tertiary sector and to increase the number of places. We have also provided additional funding to ensure that the research work at postgraduate level is undertaken-and that is extremely important in addressing the much over-used phrase of `establishing a clever country'. The current 1990-91 Budget provides for an additional 140 new postgraduate research awards. That will bring to 1,100 the number of students receiving postgraduate awards provided by this Government to ensure the excellence of study at that higher level-a commitment which was never met by those opposite and one which I suspect has been supported by them only when it suits them, in debates such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what has happened in the capital works program. I have already mentioned the general funding and the number of places for students. Let us have a look at what has gone on in capital funding. When we came to office in 1983, the higher education capital program received $50m. This year, that same program will receive $170m-they are in constant figure terms, in real terms. That is a staggering increase, one which this Government can be justly proud of and one which thousands of students around this country benefit from. Of course, the figure would look worse if we went back one year, because in 1982, the year before the Australian Labor Party came to office, the previous Government's funding was even lower still-lower than its $50m benchmark. In 1982, it managed to fund only $40m-in fact, it was less than $40m-for the capital programs in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should put paid once and for all to the hypocrisy of those opposite when they stand here and complain about the level of funding. Not only is their record in the past abysmal in these matters. Their performance today when they are confronted with difficult questions should also be looked at. We had the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), just recently saying that the Government should cut its expenditure by $3 billion-take $3 billion out of the Budget. That was the Opposition's approach only a matter of weeks ago. Where are we going to take the $3 billion from?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has had speakers up here one after the other saying that we should spend more money on education. So the Opposition is not going to cut education. It has told us it will not cut health. It has not told us where it will make any of those cuts. It has only referred to the fact that we should take $3 billion out of the Budget. That demonstrates a couple of things. It demonstrates not only the duplicity of the Opposition on these matters again, but it also demonstrates its lack of ability to think through the policy options and to articulate them clearly. It reinforces the view that we have of the front bench: a group of visiting professors who enjoy touching on subjects superficially but have yet to prove their worth in substantiating any of them.</PARA>
<PARA> Reference has also been made in this debate to the higher education contribution scheme, and those opposite have denigrated that and said what a terrible thing it is. I had a view about that a couple of years ago as well and I spoke to many people who are students and who are going to be paying the charge. I spoke to students at schools and tertiary institutions, and I must say that I was surprised to find that those people, who are actually paying it and who are about to commence paying it, support it. They believe it is an equitable and fair thing for society to say to them that they should make some contribution. I might say that I was surprised at that because, quite frankly, it was not a view I shared at that time. Nevertheless, that was the view that was put to me by those people I spoke to in the tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is the Opposition's policy on this? Having criticised our Government's decision-one which is now bedded in and seen by the community to be broadly fair-what is the Opposition going to do instead? The Opposition's policy is not to have a higher education contribution scheme in which people can defer payment until their incomes reach a level that they can afford to make small repayments on; its policy is a reversion to the 1960s, like its industrial relations policy and its general economic policy- bring back an up-front tertiary fee. </PARA>
<PARA> The only effect of an up-front tertiary fee is to deny access to those from low socio-economic backgrounds. That is what happened in the 1960s. It is to the Labor Party's credit that the Whitlam Government, as one of its very first actions, put paid to that. It is one of the reasons why the electors at the last election rejected the Opposition, and it is why they will reject the Opposition again at the next election if it fronts with the same sort of policy. Up-front tertiary fees might be neat, they might suit those in the wealthy suburbs that the Opposition represents, but they harm ordinary working class children in this country and they will not be tolerated or accepted by the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the broad philosophical brush which we have heard a fair bit about from the other side as well-the laissez faire approach to tertiary education. Some of it can sound good when it is couched in certain terminology-freedom of choice and all that sort of thing. It can go down well until one actually analyses what the effects of some of these things are. They are good old right wing fundamentalist views resurfaced. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was listening to some of the speeches from the other side, I thought of how these might translate into reality. I thought that maybe there is an example; maybe the Bond University is the sort of project, the private enterprise tertiary institution, that the Opposition believes we should have as our guiding light. If it is, somebody had better go up there and sort out the problem because the Bond University is not travelling too well at present. The exercise in laissez faire tertiary education, the exercise in free enterprise-going out into the marketplace and proving its worth in the tertiary sector-has fallen flat on its face. Everyone in this place knows that and for those opposite to continue to play with the myth is deception of the students who seek entry into tertiary institutions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to make some comment about the National Union of Students (NUS) and some of the less credible comments that were made a while ago. The National Union of Students is the major representative body of students throughout the country. On the one hand, we were told that the NUS was only a small clique of Labor sycophants and not representative of anybody else. I wish somebody would tell those NUS people who come knocking on my door that that is what they are, because they certainly do not behave like it when they talk to me. On the other hand, complaints have been made that it is compulsory to be in the NUS. That means that everybody is in the union. How can anyone tell me on the one hand that everybody is in it, and that is a bad thing, but on the other hand it is only a small group of Labor Party followers? The Opposition cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address the second point: that everybody is forced to be in it and therefore it is bad. As a former union official, I am-surprisingly-not a supporter of compulsory unionism. I am also not a supporter of people who do not pay their dues getting the benefits. There is a bit of a catch there. In one of these debates on industrial relations when we have some time I will explore that more fully. Specifically, with respect to tertiary students, the legislation which requires those students to be in a union is State legislation. The States decide that their students at their tertiary campuses will be members of a union which requires to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent some years associated with education and had dealings with teacher unions and student unions. I was always somewhat mystified how it was that in my home State of Queensland the former National Party Government staunchly supported a compulsory unionism arrangement for students on tertiary campuses. The Liberal and National parties in the State legislature had no problem with that. I can even remember the debates being waged in the 1970s and through the 1980s in Queensland as to whether that should be. However, the National-Liberal coalition, and then later the National Party Government, ruling in its own right in Queensland, consciously decided that it wanted to maintain it. It wanted to maintain a situation where all students were members of a student body through which they could voice their views on the important issues confronting them in their tertiary institutions. We do not have time to go into all the reasons why that was a sensible position for that Government to adopt and why it is one that I support. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to place on the record here that, in spite of the protestations of those opposite, their own party in Government has supported legislation, enacted legislation and retained legislation to keep student unionism compulsory. Again we have witnessed the duplicity of those opposite in their remarks in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us is straightforward, simple and needs no amendment. The amendments that have been proposed are, as I said at the outset, on the one hand philosophical diatribe and, on the other hand, a rather silly little bureaucratic change as to the number of days between tabling of reports. That is to no effect and, quite frankly, those opposite would know that it would also create some administrative difficulties in being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation deserves support. The amendments should be defeated, as they will be. Those opposite should start to reflect upon their education policies, their lack of depth and the errors they have made in the past and start working on a policy for the future which recognises the needs of the students who are coming through our schools and coming through our tertiary institutions and the adult population that will require retraining and re-education as we move into an ever increasingly changing world. They should reflect upon that and then look honestly at the funding commitment and priority that the Hawke Labor Government has given to those issues. The Hawke Labor Government's commitment in tertiary education is better than any in our history, paralleled only by the Labor Government of the early 1970s. Those opposite should recognise that and start working on new policies. </PARA>

They all know that. One only needs to go to our migrant communities and see the absolute frenetic obsession amongst parents for their children to do well in tertiary education-get through schooling and move into tertiary education-because they know that is where the future lies for them. It holds great promise for our nation if we have a well-educated population. </PARA>
<PARA> We have intelligent people; we have basically well educated people. But the trouble is that at the same time as the Government is wanting to provide these opportunities it cannot find the necessary resources. It has taken money to apply in this year's Budget or over this triennium but it has taken it from other areas. When it looks into other areas it has a whole conflict of priorities. Why does it not loosen up the system, think a little laterally and answer some of these questions?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the honourable member for Brisbane thinks the Government can achieve by having a policy that is creating unemployment and a policy that is putting more taxpayers' funds into higher education. We need to work on the unemployment problem, which is the very core of the problems this Government has. It cannot manage the economy. Where are the people the Government is educating going to be employed? What opportunities are there?</PARA>
<PARA> One only has to go into any of the institutions in Australia and talk to the students. Just a few months ago I was at Wollongong University. The significant comments did not contain criticisms of the higher education contribution scheme. The students asked: `What is going to happen when we leave this place? What is the Government doing to provide an opportunity for us when we are fully qualified and educated? There is nothing. We will join the dole queues'. That is the concern being expressed by the students. They know they are capable; they know they can apply themselves; they know that the quality of the education they have chosen is fine. But the Government is manipulating that process, and that is our big beef with the Government. It is not fair dinkum with the Australian people. It is trying to get more people off the dole queues and into tertiary education of some sort or other, but it is not attending to their needs when they leave those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a half-baked, very highly qualified approach to this area. It does not care what courses students do, as long as it gets some more dough and gets people out of the unemployment queues. Those are the policies this Government has. That is the basis of its thinking. The Government is not looking at opportunities for the young people of Australia. This huge unmet need must be dealt with. This legislation gives no thought to how that should be approached, neither does the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table. So the help that is necessary to get young people into the workplace is not available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has criticised the Government in a number of areas, and our amendments to this legislation make that clear. The increasing interference by the Government in higher education is facilitated by the intrusive educational profiles process. What is the Government up to? The Opposition's policy aims at freeing up the system a little, putting the institutions in charge of their own goals and their own future. The people they seek to attract can decide for themselves what institutions are worthy and can ask: `What have I to offer that institution? What will they set as a standard for me to gain entry?'. We do not want profiles once they have joined an institution. What is the Government after? Some sort of moderate grey uniformity out of every student in Australia? Where is the challenge and excitement that I would like to see in higher education?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table has ideas; we have heard him in this House. The Government is restricting the process, and his superior Minister or whoever he reports to needs a shakeup; he is the person to do that. Firstly, institutions ought to be determining their own admission policies. They ought to be deciding their own staffing policies and they ought to be choosing their own special emphases and interests. That is a starting point. We ought to be allowing them to interact with the community so that they can determine for themselves-instead of being imposed upon by Canberra-what sort of future they want to give their young people, their undergraduates. They should be planning completely their own futures. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that by applying this sort of philosophy to our higher education institutions in Australia, we will start to break the nexus of centralised control that is obvious from this Government. It has failed to provide a proper framework of accountability with respect to the exercise of ministerial discretion. Ministers should not go roaming around in this area without proper accountability and proper reporting processes. I suppose the Minister can be questioned in the House on any day, but what happens when he sets in train the triennium and puts his stamp on a whole lot of people? Then another Minister comes along and says, `I do not agree with my colleague. He is in the same party, but he had the emphasis wrong and I am going to fiddle it for myself.' That is not the way to go. The responsibility should be put back onto the institutions and they should be made reactive to the community they are supposed to be serving. It is only then that we will start to see some changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own area of Sydney, I have appreciated the Government's intervention and role in establishing the University of Western Sydney. That is something the people of western Sydney have wanted for a long time. But despite the claims of the Australian Labor Party, the Whitlam decisions did not open up higher education opportunities for those on lower incomes in the way that Labor thought they would. In fact, they allowed those with the knowledge and the ability and the capacity to gain information and those with higher incomes to gain increasing access to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a university in western Sydney will help to counter that. The need to engender a tradition of higher education in places such as western Sydney has been present at a lower level. The area has colleges of advanced education, and excellent ones too, but now the people there have the opportunity for full higher education. So that progress has been significant. I must admit that it took a long time for the Liberal Party of that western Sydney area to focus on the issue to the extent where it would convince the Minister of the time to implement something worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> The combining of the three campuses-Hawkesbury Agricultural College, the Nepean College of Advanced Education and Macarthur Institute-is an enlightened approach, but I want to put to the Minister that he needs to consider what is coming next. It is much easier to opt for those inexpensive humanities-based courses than deal with the technologists and the professional people of the science-based courses we need for our future. </PARA>
<PARA> The institutions I have spoken to are finding that the Government is squeezing more and more those science-based courses, asking people to conform to non-hands on, non-research based education, rather than allowing them to develop fully a knowledge of science. That is a tragedy because we are starting to fail in the provision of scientists, engineers and technologists in a wide range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Minister that what he needs to be thinking of next is what he is going to do with agricultural education. We see the institutions of Australia gradually expanding into all sorts of other things, whether it be home science courses for teachers or nursing courses or whatever, and we are starting to lose that great expertise that we had in agriculture. I suggest in passing that we need to develop a highly respected institution for agricultural education, and I would nominate Hawkesbury Agricultural College for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Something that is talked about throughout the agricultural academic community Australia-wide is what is our next step? Our great export earning industries are in chaos. They are going to need skill, management and great academic ability to move ahead. So there are opportunities and chances. It is not an immediate demand, but it is something that needs to be planned now so that in the next triennium or the one after account is taken of Australia's needs in that regard. I think it would be a great thing to see agricultural science advanced in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked with interest through this legislation and I have little more to say except that I am disappointed with the Government's failure to set real goals for this nation. The Government is saying to the kids that it is giving them more funds and opportunities, but it is not giving them more jobs. To the environmentalists the Government is saying that it cares about this nation, but it is going to hack a lot of it down. It is saying to people on welfare that it has done well by them, but there is a bigger bill to pay each year because its policies create that situation. So its policies are conflicting and confused. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard this area as one of the most significant the House has to deal with: freeing up higher education to become something of real excellence; freeing our students to select colleges and institutions and universities of their choice; putting the emphasis on their ability, with some means aspect attached to it; opening up an unlimited number of places to students who pay full fees in the same way that overseas students have to pay. I see nothing wrong with that; I believe that is where we have to go. </PARA>
<PARA> No government-not this Government-will find the complete resources needed to satisfy that thirst. Governments should go as far as they can, right to the point where they say, `The excellent and the achievers have a right and a responsibility, and those who want to make the effort should also have a chance'. The trouble with this Government is that those people who want to make an effort are missing out. They are still missing out and they will continue to miss out until the Government changes its policies, because they need changing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion and to oppose the amendment moved to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill because, quite simply, I think there has been quite a lot of confused talk here about confused and competing goals, national goals, a thirst for education, and funding under the triennium. But of course at the heart of this motion is the higher education contribution scheme (HECS), which demands a contribution from those people who are entering the higher education scheme and which demands that institutions report to the Government the kind of people who are participating in our higher education programs. That goes very much to the heart of the concerns of those people in the Opposition. As somebody who got her education in the 1960s-on a scholarship, I might add, because my parents certainly could not afford to pay for a university education-I am aware of the kind of thoughts and processes that occurred in a system which demanded that only those people who were fortunate enough to have wealthy parents were entitled to higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The higher education contribution scheme demands that institutions show that they reflect the community in which they operate. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has just said that he wishes that these institutions would reflect the communities in which they operate. I can only say that we wholeheartedly concur. As 52 per cent to 54 per cent of the population are females, we can only wish that all people were reflected equally within those institutions. I am delighted to hear the honourable member opposite say that there is a great thirst for education. Indeed there is; but the difficulty is that it is only this side of the House which believes that everybody is equally entitled to higher education. This is not a question of those people who have privileges-or of those people who perhaps by dint of their family and other opportunities are also privileged-being the only people who are entitled to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> So the very crux of the matter goes to the question of why should our higher education institutions not report to the Government on the kind of people who are participating in our education system? We as a Government are setting goals, and we are, after all, demanding that every student in Australia have equal access and equal opportunity to those places in the higher education system. So we are saying to the higher education institutions, `You then show us that you are reflecting the community in which you operate'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, institutions dislike that, and some institutions dislike it immensely. They see themselves as a very privileged elite, and that privilege is the very thing which they wish to maintain. We saw that when we moved from the binary system of funding, and we have had raised here the question of why we are funding on a triennium basis. Of course, any government which is committed to realistic planning and programming would fund on a triennium basis because it is a way in which we can be best organised and the way in which we can best offer realistic and real planning processes for our tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> So at the crux of all of this we have the Opposition, yet again, attempting to maintain the kind of power and privilege in the higher education institutions which had been there, realistically, until 1983, since when we have seen an expansion in capital funding to the tune of $200m, or five times more in 1993 than it was in 1983. That expansion in the higher education sector is unprecedented in Australian history. Of course, with that expansion goes the opportunity for those people who have previously not had the privilege or the opportunity to participate in our higher education system to do so. So we say to the institutions, `We wish to see your profiles'. As the previous speaker said, we want to see that the institutions realistically reflect the community in which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, we have the Opposition demanding that institutions reflect the communities in which they operate and; on the other hand, we have the Opposition opposing the reporting system. It simply cannot have it both ways. In Australia any expansion within the higher education system means that more people will have access to it. The other realistic fact which everybody in this House must address is that brains and skills are not the prerogative of the rich. Unfortunately, that was the kind of premise on which in the 1960s and 1970s higher education institutions operated-with the exception of some of us who happened to be Commonwealth scholarship holders. What we are saying now is, `If you have the brains, intelligence and the drive, you, too, are entitled to a place at a higher education institution and you can pay for it at a later date when you have a job'. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard the honourable member opposite suggest that the Government was not committed to finding positions for those people who had pursued higher education in the tertiary sector. What nonsense! Anybody within our community can tell us that among those people in Australia who have a tertiary qualification from an Australian institution there is virtually minimal unemployment-0.1 per cent-compared with those people who leave school at year 9, who will be virtually 90 per cent assured of being unable to find a position within Australia. That is a fact. Those people who pursue higher education in Australia and who are successful and gain a degree, diploma or certificate will in fact be virtually assured of employment. It is those people who do not have the opportunity, who do not take up the opportunity and who, for all sorts of reasons, fail to be a part of that higher education system who will have difficulty finding employment. That is why this Government has committed itself to training and to ensuring that the kind of profiles which we see through HECS are revealed to us as a Government so that we can be very sure that institutions respond to the needs of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> So I must say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are committed to this process. We are committed to the expansion of the higher education institutions; we are committed to HECS; and we are definitely committed to the profiles because they reveal to us, in a very true and honest way, a reflection of where our institutions are at and they let the institutions know that they should, and must, deliver on the kind of goals to which this Government is committed. One such goal is that, irrespective of socioeconomic status or where people come from, they are all entitled to have the opportunity to participate in the higher education institutions in this country, and we deserve to know that they are doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, not surprisingly the debate on this relatively uncontroversial Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill has become a general debate about the provision of higher education. In a sense it should be encouraging that so many honourable members have chosen to participate but unfortunately, so far as the Opposition speakers are concerned, one would have to say the number of distinct, original ideas expressed in the course of the debate was very limited. We have heard a lot of repetition. I guess it is another example of the cracked record syndrome which is so often encountered in this place. I guess there is a bit of a risk, in responding to these shibboleths time and again, of becoming a cracked record oneself. But I should make a couple of points, and I will confine my comments to the observations made about the profiles process, not least because that is one of the few things which has been canvassed which bears directly on the content of these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the Opposition education spokesman, again raised his concerns about profiles. He expressed the view that they are very poorly regarded throughout the higher education community, that they are all chafing under this terrible regime that we have imposed. That of course is demonstrably false. Once again, as I did in an earlier debate, I will quote the publication of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) titled Higher Education for the 1990s: Summary of Policies, which was issued in March 1990. On educational profiles the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the representative body of the higher education sector, said:</PARA>
<PARA>it supports the educational profile concept as it has been refined, with annual reviews and updates preferred to the former CTEC `wish list' arrangement and associated triennial visits. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, from talking to people in the sector, it is very clear that now a number of difficulties which were encountered in the early stages of the implementation of the profile system have been largely ironed out. That is confirmed by the Higher Education Council in its regular reports to Parliament, and it is conceded by the great bulk of people who are involved in the sector.

What they say, as I understand it, is that the profile system as it has been refined is now very well accepted in the system; they are not at all inclined to vary it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last thing I will say on the profiles is that the honourable member for Goldstein keeps dragging up this argument that we do not have any explicit evaluative criteria governing or guiding the profiles process. I do not know what he means by `evaluative criteria'.

<PARA>Proposed new clause-</PARA>
<PARA> Page 1, after clause 1 insert the following new clause:</PARA>

<PARA> Clause 2, page 1, at the end of the clause add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Section 25 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (3) `15 sitting days' and substituting `5 sitting days'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendments is to reduce the time between the receipt by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) of the reports of the Higher Education Council and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, and the tabling of these reports in the Parliament. One of the features of the regime for the administration of higher education which the Government has introduced is the substantial removal of the requirement on the Government to report publicly on its policies. For many years it was regarded as proper that the Government receive its advice from an independent advisory body, and that the Minister publicly respond to that advice. Through this process the nature of the Government's policy and the bases of its decisions were stated to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 there is no such requirement on the Minister. There is no statutory obligation on him to report to this Parliament on the most far-reaching decisions which have been made affecting higher education. Indeed, under this legislation the Minister exercises the most far-reaching discretion in relation to individual institutions and individual research projects. It is a system of decision making which constantly raises the suspicion that decisions can be taken for political reasons rather than for educational reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The reporting requirements on the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and on the Higher Education Council are no substitute for the Minister responding publicly. It is a long time since this Parliament has had a significant statement from the Government on higher education policy. The Minister tells us from time to time that he is going to make such a statement. I have noticed that the date of that statement keeps moving back further and further, but I suppose eventually we will get a statement from the Minister on the Government's higher education policy. We look forward to receiving that statement, debating it, and hearing the justifications, which have been long missing and long wanted, for the upheaval which has occurred in higher education in this country, to the great damage of its quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, given the administrative and advisory system for higher education which the Minister has put in place, it is welcome that at least the reports of the Higher Education Council and of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training are eventually made available, for they do touch on significant matters of concern to academic staff, to students, and to the community. They provide the trends and statistics on student enrolments and the educational profiles process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not believe that the process is the right one for the allocation of funds to higher education. It is of interest to me that the Minister constantly affects-I put it kindly-not to know the reasons the Opposition continues to call for some criteria to be clearly stated by the Government as to how it evaluates the profile of each institution to determine its role in the unified national system. The White Paper made it quite clear that the functions of the profiles process were to determine the role of the institution in the unified national system. How does the Government determine whether or not an institution is playing its desirable role on the information provided through the profiles process? Of course, the answer to that is obvious: it cannot do so. There are no such criteria. There is no plan to provide an appropriate and satisfactory structure for the unified national system. So we have a system of discretionary decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria the Minister referred to as being listed in the report on triennial funding simply do not address this fundamental issue. What is at stake here is the weakness of the whole system of the central planning of higher education which the Government has initiated. It is the weakness of any attempt to centrally plan very complex sets of institutions and activities. It cannot be done effectively from the centre. In the end the whole system comes to rely on bureaucratic decision making. The Opposition does not believe that this process is in any way satisfactory, but we recognise that it is the process that the Government has adopted, and we have no desire to impede its execution. We have been prepared to listen to the Government on its amendments. We have taken a broad attitude and a welcoming attitude. We have been prepared to hear the Government's arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> The obligation to report in February and August, which the Government is seeking to change, was a requirement which the Opposition supported at the time the Act was passed because we were concerned at the efforts being made by the Government to reduce the flow of information to the Parliament. We have heard the Government's argument on the practicalities of the process of gathering and processing information and we are prepared to accept that a comprehensive report should be available in March each year. But we have frankly been concerned at the length of time it has taken for these reports to reach the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Higher Education Council, which was presented to the board in August, was not made public by the Minister until November. There was a period of some six weeks between the presentation of the report by the Higher Education Council to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the transmission of that report to the Minister. The report was not made available to the Parliament until November. It is obvious that the present requirement-the Minister has 15 sitting days in which to make the report available to the Parliament-can lead to a delay which can be as great as three months, or perhaps even more, from the time it is issued by the Higher Education Council. It is to shorten this period that the Opposition is moving amendments which require a reduction of the period that the Minister has from 15 days to five days to place these reports before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want to suggest that this reduction will be of more than marginal advantage to this Parliament. There is still a substantial capacity for delay built into the procedures and the content of this report is very limited compared with the nature of the information this Parliament would certainly wish to have available to it. Nevertheless, the amendment we propose is an improvement. It expresses our great concern-and I must say the concern of the higher education community-about the fact that the Government is simply not presenting in any way a persuasive case to the higher education community in this country about the rationale for its policies. There is bewilderment throughout the higher education sector in this country about its direction and the basis of the Government's decisions. We need comprehensive statements from this Government. The best the Government is prepared to offer us at the moment are the reports that we are getting through the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. We want to see those reports tabled in the Parliament at the earliest practicable opportunity. That is why we move these amendments.</PARA>

If this amendment were adopted, a report would be made available to the Minister, say, yesterday and have to be tabled on Thursday next week. It seems to me-and this is the advice that I have received from the Department of Employment, Education and Training-that that would create a totally impractical situation in terms of, apart from anything else, the requirement to print the reports in that time, some of which are quite complex with quite complex tables.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to report to this Committee that I am very disappointed at the response of the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Baldwin) to this debate tonight. The Minister said in his contribution, brief though it was, in response to all the speeches that were given in the House tonight on this legislation that there were too many speakers on a minor Bill. He said that there was some repetition. In my contribution I asked the Minister some nine or 10 questions and I certainly did not hear him respond to one of them at the dispatch box at the close of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not consider that the contribution by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), was anything other than a very major contribution. It was very detailed and comprehensive. Yet it is easy for the Minister to slough it off and say, `Well, the Opposition's views are frivolous and not to be taken into account'. It is just not good enough. If we ask the Minister substantive questions and raise substantive issues, one would think that if he cared about his portfolio, the students in this country and whether or not the system was working, instead of sitting there knowing smugly that this great bureaucratic machine that the Government has built up over the past eight years is hiding all this information that we need on what is going on in our system, he would listen to the Opposition and respond properly to our genuine concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the contribution by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) this evening. It was a terrific contribution. As I recall, the honourable member for Brisbane said that the shadow Minister's amendment was nonsensical. I believe that he repeated that some five or six times. He said that the amendment was very difficult to implement. The amendment is very detailed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Minister would be better served by answering some of the questions than by trying to interrupt parliamentary debate. I will continue on the contribution made by the honourable member for Brisbane. The honourable member for Brisbane used the term `philosophical diatribe by the Opposition' at least 10 times in an 18 minute speech. He further used the word `duplicity' at least that many times in the same speech. Honest to goodness, this is an objective attempt to bring to the Government's attention some of the serious deficiencies that we find in its education policy, and one would think that he could come up with a little better language than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister at the table, in his response to the debate, said that the Opposition objections to the profile system are just a nonsense. Everything is nonsensical. If the Minister does not have an answer, then it is a nonsense. If he has no answer or reason, then it is simplistic. What we have asked for is a detailed answer. </PARA>
<PARA> We really do not understand how the profile system works because it is bound up in this whole great bureaucratic system. That is a point that has been made to the Minister over and over again. Once a major bureaucracy is built up to run a system, rather than our letting the system run itself and its individual parts work to produce excellence, the system is out of control because the bureaucracy in the end runs the system. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that when we start talking about ministerial discussion-which, as the shadow Minister pointed out before, is part of this system on profiling about which we would like to know-we are talking about secrecy. I recall that a bit over a year ago the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) changed all the rules on immigration. We used to have an immigration policy that had a great deal of ministerial discretion. He took it all away and now we have a set of procedural advice manuals that is so long that we cannot even have a copy in our electorate offices. So instead of denigrating the shadow Minister and the Opposition for pointing out valid points of concern regarding this legislation, I would think that the Minister might be able to answer the question. </PARA>
<PARA> When the shadow Minister calls for the time to be reduced from 15 sitting days to five, that is a very sensible proposition. The bureaucracy clearly has a hold of ministerial decision making. We all know how good the bureaucracy is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just listened to Government members and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) extolling the virtues of their higher education initiatives. I would like to balance those views with an extract from a letter of 29 January this year from the University College of Southern Queensland Student Association to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) highlighting yet another anomaly of the access and equity program established to provide an opportunity for disadvantaged adults to enter tertiary education. I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The UCSQ Student Association has recently received a number of complaints from students over the loss in 1991 of the major part of their Austudy allowances. They are generally mature age female students whose spouses earn between $13 000 and $20 000 per year and who have between one and four children . . . These recent Austudy changes, which are penalising many mature-aged students, are in danger of making a mockery of the whole Access and Equity Programme. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum taxable income that the working spouse of a student can now earn before reductions in Austudy allowances begin, has been cut from $18 150 per annum in 1990 to $12 150 per annum for 1991-a reduction of over $6 000 in real terms. For every two dollars earned by the working spouse over $12 150 the student loses one dollar of their Austudy Allowance. These cuts are having drastic consequences for those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example of the ramifications of this policy, one of the students who contacted the Student Association is a mature-age mother of three children whose spouse earns just over $19 000 per annum. She has just been advised that her Austudy has been cut from $198.00 per fortnight in 1990 to just $30.68 for 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Students who have counted the cost of full-time study in financial, social and emotional terms, and who have then committed themselves to acquiring a tertiary education have found that the rules have been changed half way through their courses and their anticipated financial support has been cut to almost token levels . . . An income of $12 150, or $228.00 per week after tax is just 51.6% of the Australian average weekly income of $442.00 per week after tax for a full-time adult worker. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research fixes the poverty level for the family profiled above at $402.00 per week nett . . . These students, who were enticed into tertiary study through the Government's promise of Access and Equity have seen the hope of an improved standard of living through improved job opportunities for tertiary graduates slip from their grasp. This has occurred through no fault of their own. With reductions in family incomes of the order of $170.00 per fortnight, many are finding that they are unable to continue with their studies. They are being forced to abandon their studies and to seek work to make ends meet again. This represents a significant waste of the resources already invested in their education. </PARA>
<PARA> These cuts are most inequitable, arbitrary in nature, unthinking and contrary to the spirit and stated intentions of the Access and Equity Programme and the Government's stated intentions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Palestinians are now undergoing a new trauma as their resettlement in Kuwait is resisted and individuals are brutalised. Their problems must now be moved up several notches of priority in the postwar peace settlement. The Palestinians comprise more than four million Arabs in three principal locations: in Israel and the occupied territories; in the neighbouring states of Jordan and Lebanon; and in their diaspora throughout the rest of the Arab world-notably in the Gulf where they comprise the most talented and industrious of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past, their political mouthpiece has been recognised as the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO)-and umbrella but not popularly elected body. The Palestinian question has elicited four principal suggested solutions: firstly, the replacement of Israel by Palestine, a clearly unattainable and undesirable outcome; secondly, the partition of Israel plus the occupied territories into two states, a result strategically unacceptable to Israel and until 1988 ruled out by the PLO's leader, Yasser Arafat; thirdly, the absorption of the Palestinians into other states, including Israel-this outcome has clearly not eventuated after 43 years-and, fourthly, an option which has been urged by Israeli and American right-wing opinion: the designation of Jordan as a Palestinian homeland. I have long believed that this has limited merits, but these may have been strengthened by the recent war. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's aggression against Kuwait received support from only three authorities in the Arab world: the Yemeni regime, which has backtracked at great pace; Arafat's PLO, which will surely suffer retribution from its Arab patrons; and King Hussein of Jordan. Whether Jordan was offered the holy places in a carve up of Saudi Arabia may be doubted. But King Hussein chose to side with Iraq at critical times in the dispute, despite his throne's invention by the British, its subvention by the West and its financial patronage by the House of Saud. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 King Hussein renounced the West Bank and Arafat conceded Israel's existence almost simultaneously in recognition of their declining position, which was a result of the withdrawal of the Soviets from that situation. Their recent behaviour has further lessened their options, but I do not believe that in any way it is a valid option to call for the eviction of three-quarters of a million Palestinian Arabs from the West Bank, as has been again advocated in this morning's paper by Ze'evi. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Palestinian people, as opposed to their disastrous PLO leadership, for which they can be blamed only in small measure, the further option is now open; that is, the consolidation of a Palestinian-cum-Jordanian state by merging most of the West Bank with Jordan, with a part of it-the strategically significant part for Israel-with Israel. This would simultaneously satisfy Israel's legitimate security concerns and Palestinian statehood aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether such proposals are presently acceptable to an understandably obdurate and cautious Israeli Government led by Prime Minister Shamir is questionable, but presumably he will not last for ever. The recent behaviour of the PLO and King Hussein in prattling hypocritically about democracy and self-determination while backing the Butcher of Baghdad has somewhat diminished the force of the objections they will raise. Urging such accommodation on them might be a suitable recompense for their recent opportunism in any case. Whichever of these options is taken-they are many, and I have tried to itemise them-it is clearly a long time overdue that some resolution of the Palestinian problem should be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Starting on television tonight is a three-part series on the reasons for and origins of terrorism in the modern world and its effects on travel, on civilised behaviour, on airports and on general life in the Western world over the past 20 years. I do not believe that one can exclusively attribute this to the problems of the Palestinian people or other dispossessed people; they have to bear some responsibility for their actions. Nonetheless, as a result of the blood we have recently shed and of the pain and treasure we have expended in evicting the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, it is an appropriate time to undertake a generalised settlement in the Middle East, which will have to incorporate some resolution of the needs of the Palestinian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on the statements today by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on overseas debt. I have not actually seen the papers he tabled, but he is so adept at calling black white and white black that I would strongly suspect that the papers did not bear out the relatively benign impression of the growth of the overseas debt under this Government that he managed to convey. I base my remarks on a graph in the Business Council of Australia document Developing Australia's National Competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not necessarily want to canvass what happened under the previous Government, but let us start at 1982-83. At that time, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said in his comment, the net overseas debt as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) was 13.7 per cent. I stress that at that time the servicing of the debt amounted to just 8 per cent of our export earnings, a relatively benign situation. When we come to 1989-90, the ratio of the overseas debt to GDP had risen from that 13 1/2 per cent to 33 1/2 per cent, a two-and-a-half-fold increase, which the Treasurer was inclined to dismiss. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, shameful. More importantly, the net interest payable overseas amounted to 20 per cent of our export earnings. The nation as a whole pays it, but it impacts on people's standards of living, it constrains our future development, and so on. There was a two-and-a-half-fold increase to a quantum of 20 per cent of our export earnings. Taking dividends with the interest, the figure is in the area of 25 per cent. When we get a net income payable overseas of the order of 25 per cent, we are getting into the area where the red lights start to flash for foreign investors and international credit rating organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer also commented that over recent years there was a levelling off in this ratio. I simply comment that that has to do with the considerable appreciation of the Australian dollar over that period, contrasting with the very sharp increase during the time of the actual devaluation. We have to take the trend over the whole period. Honourable members may recall that at one stage last year the dollar touched almost US90c. It has that sort of valuation effect. It does not detract from the trend of the growth in this debt over the period. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make is that the increase in debt under the previous Liberal-National Party Administration was basically to finance long term productive investment, particularly in the resources area, which has stood this country in very good stead and is standing it in very good stead at this moment. Over the period of the Hawke Government there cannot be any reasonable doubt but that much of that debt was to finance personal, private and public consumption-not to mention, even within the investment category, a considerable amount of investment in office blocks, many of which remain empty, shopping complexes and the like-not productive business investment that would contribute to our extra export production and replacement of imports. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, as the situation stands at the moment, the debt is a very serious one. We are in a debt trap where we have to borrow every month just to pay the interest and, as I said before, our development is constrained and we are made very vulnerable to external shocks from overseas. </PARA>

It really does strain the credibility and I think does no credit to the alarmist people who go around with this sort of nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am reminded of the alarm everybody felt about the presence of insecticides in fruit and vegetables. In the decade since the issue was first raised by an American professor it is one of the things we have been most concerned about. He now says that he recognises that 99 per cent of all residues are naturally occurring in vegetables. Vegetables make their own poisons and some of them are very potent. Man made insecticides are apparently a very insignificant part of this. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern was raised about certain organochloride residues in meat in the United States. This never at any stage had anything to do with health; it was simply a non-tariff trade embargo introduced by the United States to prejudice imports from this country. Had those same tests been applied to meat in the United States, the Americans would have found readings far in excess of the readings which were obtained from some samples of Australian meat. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that this attitude we are developing that we must be guided by the judgment of government or some other body is pervading all walks of life. It is pervading us in the area of trade, and I fear that we are becoming far too complacent in the area of trade and not looking wide enough or thinking laterally enough in terms of increasing our trade. </PARA>
<PARA> It occurs to me that the situation has turned around radically in shipbuilding. A few years ago, ships were glutting the market. Now, large tankers and bulk carriers are in very short supply. It takes five years to get delivery of a ship. If a ship is ordered today, it takes five years for it to be delivered. There is a world shortage of ships. On the other hand, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has a large underutilised capacity for shipbuilding. I would not have thought that it would be beyond the capacity of our people to go to the Soviet Union and say, `Look, you build us ships which are needed and we will pay you in produce which you need'. Having satisfied our own needs, I believe that we could then broke these ships to the world. We could pay for Russian ships with our wheat, wool and meat, and then sell them to the world which is anxious to get these ships and at the moment has to wait so long. If we were to do this deal with the Russians, we could cut that delivery date in half. It would certainly go a long way towards solving the rural crisis in which this country is now placed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past few days quite a lot has been said in the House about resource security legislation without actually saying what it means. Hoping for enlightenment, I looked at a paper recently circulated by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to members of his own Party who were apparently entertaining doubts about it all. This document was entitled An Information Paper on Resource Security. With that title, one might expect it to provide some answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it is a document that is very wordy and says very little. On first reading, it is a statement that offers absolute reassurance to all sides. All imaginable fears are dispelled. Everyone comes out a winner. It leaves no doubt that in every respect the new process will be an improvement. The reader is dazzled by the brilliance of it all and reluctant to quibble about the details, which of course remain a mystery. </PARA>
<PARA> On any reasonable analysis of the Minister's paper, it is clear that the push for resource security legislation is coming mainly from the woodchip and pulp industry. The industry is saying that environmental controls are stopping forestry developments from going ahead. The industry wants to set aside the provisions of the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Environment Protection Act and other environmental procedures to the extent that they might affect proposed forestry developments. The industry also wants the process to neutralise similar legislation and procedures at State level. The information statement circulated by the Minister for Resources, if one reads between the lines, supports that analysis. What the Minister seems to mean by resource security is a switching off of the system of environmental controls installed at Federal and State level over the past 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> These are difficult times for Australia, and I am not against reviewing government administration to remove waste and inefficiency, to lift unnecessary burdens from business and improve economic performance. However, there is a risk that people will panic and try to throw out the baby with the bath water. The resource security debate is showing signs of going that way. I do not accept that our environmental controls are such an obstacle to investment in Australian forest industries as to justify them being cleared out of the way. </PARA>
<PARA> Requiring environmental impact studies from developers is not unreasonable. Having an organisation like the Heritage Commission to identify areas of importance so that we can be aware of their value when making decisions about them is not unreasonable either. Australia is currently running a net trade deficit of $1.8 billion in the forest products sector, but I do not believe that environmental controls are responsible for that. I believe it has more to do with the high level of the Australian dollar, industry inefficiencies and a variety of other factors. Lifting environmental controls, which is what resource security is really about, would just add to the range of subsidies enjoyed by forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee of the New South Wales Parliament recently exposed the extent of these subsidies. They are paid for by the taxpayer and delivered to forest industries through the pricing policies and services of the State Forestry Commission, which accumulated a debt of $100m. The New South Wales Public Accounts Committee recommended increases in the prices to industry for sawlogs and pulp from native forests after finding these resources had been underpriced and subsidised. The cure for our trade deficit in forest products is in industry restructuring, improved efficiency and better marketing, not in discarding basic environmental controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can sustain a long term and expanding forest industry, but not by succumbing to short term pressures or looking for a quick fix for immediate problems. With a very substantial softwood plantation resource coming on stream in the next decade, the forest industry can grow and help to turn around our currently unfavourable terms of trade. The Federal Government should ensure that the industry can be weaned off the subsidised native forest resource for its supply of pulp wood. The future lies in plantations and import replacement. The Australian Conservation Foundation has encapsulated the real meaning of resource security legislation in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>Resource security legislation is protectionism aimed at facilitating continued private sector access to a public resource at the cheapest price, with the highest level of public subsidy possible and for as long as possible. </PARA>

Resource security is really saying that, subject to a whole range of conditions, including environmental conditions, the agreement which has been sealed between State and Federal governments and industry can go ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the timber industry in south-eastern Australia, an environmental impact statement was financed by the industry. Studies were undertaken by the New South Wales Government, the Victorian Government and the Australian Government. The Australian Government put on staff who were foresters to ensure that what was happening in the forests was being monitored, and they actually altered some of the logging regimens being proposed. In the end, agreement was reached between the governments and the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement included a whole range of conditions-conditions that there be a move to plantations and the better utilisation of timber: for instance, in Victoria, where timber is lying on the floor rotting and being burnt because it will not be supplied to the woodchip industry, that timber can be used far better by woodchipping it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a range of conditions on the use of equipment so that there will be a better move to equipment. The timber industry has said to governments that if they are prepared to say, `We have come up with these agreements; we have got all these conditions, including environmental conditions, and we are prepared to let you have that and guarantee that to you', then it is prepared to spend money on investing in its own industry so that it can use the wood in a better way than it is being used at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the sawmills will install equipment which will use wood more efficiently. For instance, there may be a recovery mill so that some of the wood that is being chipped at the moment can be used for better purposes. Sophisticated equipment may be placed in sawmills which will enable them to use more of the wood than is being used at the moment for woodchipping. There may be pulp mills in Tasmania and in south-eastern Australia. This will help get rid of the $1.9 billion deficit that is, in part, due to the import of timber and timber products. That is extremely important in today's economy. So we are satisfying the environmental, economic and social concerns of Australians, particularly those involved in the timber industry through this resource legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few minutes ago the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) raised his concerns and questioned the accuracy of the report that was released yesterday titled Estimating the Economic Costs of Drug Abuse in Australia. This report was prepared by Professor Collins of Macquarie University and Ms Helen Lapsley, Senior Lecturer in Health Economics at the University of New South Wales. The report was commissioned by the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse because of concerns in the community not only because 26,000 lives are lost as a result of the effects of drugs in Australia every year but also because obviously that would signify and indicate a very significant cost to the Australian economy. The whole idea was to attempt to quantify that cost. Contrary to the views of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, what was delivered by the methodology is a report that, I believe, will stand up to absolute and total scrutiny by any honourable member, any other economist or anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite amazing that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie can come into this House and make such comments against this report without even having seen it, as far as I am aware. He certainly has not approached my office to get a copy. I think that even by his own admission, he probably has not even read it. So I think we need to establish the reason why this report was commissioned. It was not, as I think the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was trying to indicate, simply and solely for some reasons of social engineering, or whatever other terminology he used. The report is really aimed at trying to find out where the effects are and the impact that drugs are having not only on the lives of Australians but on the cost to our economy as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, 26,000 Australians die each year, which is equivalent to 500 people dying each week. If we put that in the context of a disaster in this country and consider it on a weekly or an annual basis, the human consequences are something which Australians certainly need to look at. Unfortunately, we have come to live with the consequences because many of the aspects of the drug problem are very much part of our culture and lifestyle. Nonetheless, they need far more consideration than the kiss-off that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has just given to them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with the report was that, while many sources of information from Government Budget documents through to a large number of reports that are being published as a result of Australian research have indicated that there is a limitation on the information that is available, the report, in coming to the conclusion that the economic cost of drug abuse in Australia is reaching $14.39 billion per annum, quite clearly and unequivocally states that that is an absolute minimum. Where estimates were provided in any report, the lowest estimate was always taken; where something could not be quantified, it was not included. In fact, it is very difficult to get information in relation to drugs in a lot of areas of health statistics in Australia because many of the conditions are not related to alcohol, tobacco or other drug abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems we do have within the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and with the sale and use of other medication of over the counter variety is that to get accurate data on the abuse of prescription medication, we have to have a definition of what is `use' and what is `abuse'. We also have to then basically try to gain that information in a way that as yet we are not able to, because it could impinge upon a person's privacy or the records within the scheme. Similarly, it is very difficult to estimate the abuse of over-the-counter medication with the limited information we have. </PARA>

We have limited information in relation to absenteeism and many other issues of productivity. I invite the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and any other honourable member to examine this report if they wish to, as I am quite happy to provide it to them. I am also quite happy to provide them, by any means they wish, with an opportunity to ensure that the compilation of the report has been conducted with absolute scrutiny as to the figures that have led to the conclusion that $14.3 billion is the annual cost of drug abuse in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Transactions between the purchaser and the fuel distributor are subject to commercial arrangements between the parties and are not matters which the diesel fuel rebate scheme seeks to influence.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme does allow a purchaser of diesel fuel to claim rebate on application made to the Australian Customs Service (ACS), immediately after the purchase of the fuel and before the fuel is used, provided the fuel was purchased for an eligible use. The application must be supported by the purchase invoice.</PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement was deliberately made to facilitate the payment of rebate particularly in cases where large quantities of fuel are stored and some time would elapse before the fuel is actually used.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since its introduction in 1982, the scheme has been reviewed and modified a number of times. In particular, the method used to process rebate applications and the various eligibility rules.
