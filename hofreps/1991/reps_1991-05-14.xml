<PARA>We are now in a crisis which is as great as the crisis of war.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Prime Minister, given that foreign debt has significantly worsened and that we are in the worst recession for 60 years, why he has not shown the same leadership in the economic war that has ravaged almost all Australians as he did in making our commitment to the Gulf war.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3617" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition goes back to 1986, because I understand that there has been a good deal of re-tracking to 1986 relating to a comment by my colleague the Treasurer back in that period. It seems appropriate, therefore, in order to satisfy the Leader of the Opposition-because, presumably, he regards it as a serious question-that I should indicate to him at some length just what leadership has been provided in that period and what achievements have been made for this country in that period. Those achievements only came from the leadership that this Government provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me, first of all, look at the macro-economic change in the period since 1986. In the year to the June quarter of 1986 the underlying inflation rate was 9.8 per cent. In the year to the December quarter of 1990 it was 5.4 per cent. That is a remarkable reduction by any standards. Looking at employment, since May 1986 almost three-quarters of a million new jobs have been created, with employment growing at an average annual rate of 2 per cent; that is some three times the rate of employment growth that the government which the Leader of the Opposition was advising was able to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the question of manufactured exports, the volume of manufactured exports in 1989-90 was 90 per cent up on the period 1985-86. That was an average annual real rate of growth of 17 1/2 per cent. If we look in the area of tax, there has been a whole raft of tax reforms in that period, including reductions in personal and corporate tax. Let us look at the top rate of personal tax. In 1985-86 it was 60 per cent-the level that you walked out of office with. That is the best you could do-60 per cent. It is currently 47 per cent.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The Prime Minister might refer to `the Opposition' rather than `you', lest people think he is referring to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I would never find you guilty of what the Opposition was guilty of. When the Opposition was in government, it walked out of office with a top personal tax rate of 60 per cent. We have reduced that to 47 per cent. The corporate tax rate in 1985-86 was 46 per cent. It is now 39 per cent. In 1985-86 the goldmining industry enjoyed a quite unjustified exemption from corporate tax. That situation was remedied, with effect from 1 January this year. Members of the Opposition do not like being reminded of the Budget deficit that we inherited, Mr Speaker, but I will tell them what it was. It was $9.6 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Opposition should ask their friend the ex-Senator Stone what was in prospect. He will tell them that it was $9.6 billion. In 1985-86 the Budget deficit was almost $5 3/4 billion. In 1989-90 we had achieved a surplus of just over $8 billion, a turnaround in that period from 1985-86 of just on $14 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at investment, we find that business fixed investment, as a share of real non-farm gross domestic product, was 11.2 per cent in 1985-86. It peaked at a record 13.7 per cent in 1988-89 and remained well above average at 13.2 per cent in 1989-90. If we look, very importantly, at something that those opposite should hang their heads in shame about-the area of superannuation-it will be seen that we are changing the face of superannuation in this country, turning something which was a privilege for the few into a right for all workers. We are working both through the accord and through the sorts of reforms to the tax system we announced in May 1988. Those are the great and enduring changes that we have brought about for the benefit of this country in the area of macro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the area of micro-economic reform. Let me take up a bit of time of the House in referring to the massive changes since then. In that period since 1986 we have continuously pushed back the constraints in what is achievable. Mr Speaker, I suggest that if in 1986 you had been told that a government in this country-any government-could have gone as far as we have in reforming the micro economy, you would have been met with utter disbelief. For example, I refer to the area of tariff cuts-an area where the Opposition never did anything. It was in office year after year and it kept the economy insular, protected by these high tariff walls. We have virtually knocked those walls down. They have been virtually eradicated by the decisions we have taken in just five years. The average effective rates of assistance were 22 per cent in 1983; today they are 12 per cent. By the end of the decade they will be 5 per cent. Nominal rates are similarly falling, from 13 per cent on average to 3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should look at what has been done in other areas of micro-economic reform in this period: deregulation of domestic aviation; deregulation of foreign investment; the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport and the great reforms that, it has been acknowledged, have come from that; telecommunications reform, first in 1988, to remove some of the more obvious impediments in that area to competition in secondary markets and then, more recently, for direct competition; award restructuring and productivity bargaining to add flexibility to a wages system, while in the outcome retaining an achievable national aggregate result; deregulation of oil marketing; major reforms of the defence industries, removing a large drain on the taxpayers' resources; reduction of crew sizes in the area of maritime industry, bringing down the manning levels in Australia to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development averages by 1992; and a program of waterfront reform, firstly, to reduce manning levels in the industry, secondly, to lift productivity, thirdly, to remove industry levies and, fourthly, to create a genuine system of company based employment and the competitive dynamic which that will produce.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me add that, while all those things have been done in this period under the leadership of this Government in the area of macro reform and micro reform, this Government has also been about building a more just society. Let me prove my point. The fundamental building blocks that this Government has provided for creating a more just Australian society are: firstly, Medicare; secondly, taxation reform, including the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax; and, thirdly, increasing real benefits for those in society most in need. There have been further improvements in social justice since 1986, despite the constraints that have been placed upon this country by the external adjustment task.</PARA>
<PARA> Without doubt, the most important of these achievements has been the family allowance supplement which was introduced in December 1987 to assist low income families. In 1991 we provided over half a billion dollars for family allowance supplement-$587m to be precise. Combined with family allowance, we now provide the equivalent of $50 net income per week to low income families with two children. In addition, rent assistance was extended to low income families in December 1987. Commonwealth funded child-care places have increased by more than 80 per cent to 155,600 places. Since 1986 there have been further increases in social welfare benefits and pensions in real terms, bringing the pension up to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA> That reform process is continuing. The Minister assisting me on social justice is overseeing an important agenda reform, including ameliorating locational disadvantage through addressing problems of access to employment, education and services faced by people living in particular areas, such as the outer fringes of our major cities and rural and remote areas. Of course, the coalition, to the contrary, is not at all interested in social justice. What it is about is re-entrenching privilege in this country. It would do that by abandoning the fundamental building blocks of Medicare and capital gains tax, and by an attack on the social welfare system. When we look at all those areas-macro-economic reform, micro-economic reform and social justice-we have a total refutation of this absurd allegation that leadership has not been provided by me or the Treasurer and this Government since 1986. As a result of all that has been done, this economy will be a stronger economy and the foundations of social justice in this country have been advanced.</PARA>

<TITLE>SCHOOLCHILDREN: DIET</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3619" SPEAKER="Snowdon The Hon W.E." NAMEID="IJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NORTHERN TERRITORY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware of media reports last week about the poor diet of many schoolchildren? What is the Government doing to educate schoolchildren about improving their diet?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3619" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question. It refers to the issue of nutrition and diet, which is extraordinarily important to all Australians. A number of Australians suffer from poor nutrition, which is a major cause of many illnesses, particularly for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The situation faced by so many people reflects the problems of nutrition and diet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reports that the honourable member referred to followed the launch of a booklet called The Nutritional Value of Australian Foods. That booklet was launched at Darebin Parklands Secondary College in my electorate. The Department assisted the food science class at Darebin College to conduct a snapshot breakfast survey of 100 students the day before the launch. That survey showed that 14 boys and 17 girls consumed no food or drink before school on that day. Of the children that had eaten breakfast, 10 per cent of the boys and 16.5 per cent of the girls had eaten only one thing-for example, fruit jubes, cheese twisties, a Wagon Wheel, Coca-Cola, cough lollies or chewing gum.</PARA>
<PARA> The media around the country conducted their own snapshot surveys which backed up both this finding and the more authoritative results from the national dietary survey of schoolchildren aged 10 to 15 years, which found that 8.5 per cent of boys and nearly 10 per cent-9.8 per cent-of girls did not consume anything before 9 a.m. on a school day. In a total number of respondents of over 5,000, that is a very significant number. These are shocking figures in many respects. They indicate an underlying problem which results in very substantial health risks and, ultimately, poor health for many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the reasons why the Government, as part of its better health program, has given the strongest emphasis to the whole area of nutrition. It is one of the reasons why the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program Everybody, which many honourable members would have seen, has been supported by the Government and it has very rapidly become one of the highest ranking programs within the ABC as it seeks to deal with the issue of poor nutrition in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously a great deal needs to be done in the area of nutrition. I cannot help thinking-and I am sure my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would agree with me-that if we are going to deal with the appalling health problems of Aboriginal people there is no more significant problem to be faced than seeking to improve the level of nutrition.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue for people in remote areas is a much more serious one in many respects than it is for those of us who live in metropolitan areas. It is one of the reasons why one is rather shocked and amazed that the Opposition should float, as indeed it has, the notion of a consumption tax, recognising that the cost of food in the Kimberleys is already 40 per cent above the cost in metropolitan areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it is not news in Western Australia that the concept of a consumption tax is being floated by the Opposition.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The highest rate of unemployment in 1982 was 9.4 per cent and the current Treasurer described the Australian economy in 1982 as being in depression. As unemployment is now 9.9 per cent and rising, on the Treasurer's own definition is Australia now in a depression?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3620" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the honourable gentleman's definitions in a moment, but let me point out that the peak of unemployment in the 1982-83 recession was, of course, in double digits-I think it was 10.4 per cent. Let me point out that, if there had been the participation rate then that we have now, it would have been about 14.5 per cent. So Opposition members cannot take any comfort from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that the honourable gentleman has now produced an index from which he purports that he can draw some comfort in regard to the Government's performance vis-a-vis the Opposition's in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Before I go to the details of this subject, let me say that of course no-one can draw any joy at all out of the recent increases in unemployment. The Treasurer and I have said, and relevant Ministers have said, that we deeply regret the hurt that has been caused as a result of the necessary economic decisions that we have taken. Very unfortunately, in this country today, the Opposition-particularly the shadow Treasurer-is taking every opportunity to talk down the Australian economy.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members gleefully greet any bad news, dismiss any good news, and their latest performance is the so-called misery index that has been produced by the honourable gentleman who asked the question. It is very interesting that according to popular economics where this misery index has been used, the misery index has traditionally been the sum of the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that basis, the traditional misery index that has been used peaked in 1982-83 at over 21. In the December quarter of last year it was 15. In other words, the traditional misery index peaked in the coalition's recession at 21; it was 15 in the December quarter of last year. It is likely that that index will remain broadly unchanged with the release of the March quarter consumer price index tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA> So, quite clearly, the traditional misery index did not suit the honourable member for Flinders. That was no good to him because when he used the traditional misery index it revealed 21 for the coalition and 15 in December under this Government. So the traditional misery index did not fit the Opposition's rhetoric. So, undeterred by that, it decided to invent one of its own. This was released over the weekend by the honourable member for Flinders. It should be dubbed, of course, the Reith index because Reith and misery are synonymous.</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that this creation of the shadow Treasurer is made up of unemployment, inflation, interest rates, taxation and foreign debt. Of course, we are not told how it is compiled. One can only assume, of course, coming from that source, that the figures are arranged in a way that provides the best light from the coalition's point of view. So it is not a great surprise that when we have a look at this index that has been released by the honourable member for Flinders--</PARA>

They are the figures that the coalition has produced in its index. It seems that the coalition's index has gone up from 1983 to 1991 by the order of 35 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as I was saying, if we look at this so-called index, we find in the period from 1983 to 1991 that it rose by 35 per cent. If we look at the period from 1975 to 1983-the period for which the coalition had responsibility-the misery index produced by this gentleman increased by 50 per cent. In other words, in their period of office, a 50 per cent increase; a 35 per cent increase under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders cannot even, out of his own production, produce a case which would establish that there has been a degree of incompetence in regard to the production of misery greater on this side than on his own. We do not accept the compilation of the index. All I am saying is that, on the face of it, they did infinitely worse in their period of office than we have done in ours.</PARA>
<PARA> The important point is this: by the production of these sorts of indices, by the way they get up in this House, they attempt to produce the impression that they have some sort of compassion for those in this community who are suffering from the current economic difficulties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, they would introduce voucher systems for education and health. Thirdly, they would introduce an inflationary consumption tax. Fourthly, as we found out in this House last week, in regard to workers in this country who would be required to undertake a whole process of restructuring, retraining and reforms which would bring in enormous productivity increases in this country, the position of those opposite is that the reward of those workers would be exactly nothing. Those workers would get nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this House, by way of interjection last week, honourable members opposite said in regard to the waterfront that waterside workers should get no increase at all for a situation where they produced a 60 per cent increase in productivity. That is the sort of compassion that these people have. It is a charade. It is mass hypocrisy to suggest that those opposite have the beginning of compassion for the people in this community who are suffering-as they are suffering in these present tough economic circumstances. Everything that the Opposition is saying it would do would compound the misery of these people and give no incentive whatsoever to any worker in this country to undertake the reform which is necessary to make for a more competitive economy in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not like it. The balance of goods and services in April 1986 was a deficit of $952m for the month. In March 1991, the latest available figures, it is a surplus of $231m-from a deficit of $952m to a surplus of $231m. From May 1986 to March 1991, monthly merchandise exports have increased by 80 per cent-a 13 per cent per annum average annual rate of improvement. Monthly manufactured exports-as distinct from merchandise exports-from May 1986 to March 1991 have increased by 178 per cent per month; that is a 23.6 per cent per annum average annual rate of improvement in manufactured exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are talking about structural change, we must be talking about manufactured exports, merchandise exports, balance of goods and services, and balance on merchandise trade-all a huge, vast change. On the current account deficit, from April 1986 to March 1991 the monthly current account deficit improved by 23.4 per cent. In terms of gross domestic product, another measure-off the balance of payments and onto GDP-constant price, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 15 per cent on a quarterly basis from the June quarter of 1986 to the December quarter 1990. In the same period, GDP per head increased by 7 per cent. Total employment, seasonably adjusted, increased by 11 per cent from May 1986 to April 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister covered the inflation figures adequately when he said that the consumer price index (CPI) quarterly change in the same period for the year before to the June quarter 1986 was 9.8 per cent and to the December quarter 1990 it was 6.88 per cent, at an underlying rate of 5.4 per cent. On investment, capital expenditure, constant prices, seasonally adjusted, all industries total has increased by 23 per cent from the March quarter of 1986 to the December quarter of 1990. So if those opposite are listening to a retinue of structural change, if they think they are hearing it, they are right: they are hearing it.</PARA>
<PARA> Changes in public spending: in 1985-86 outlays were 36 per cent of GDP and revenues were 27 per cent. In 1989-90, outlays were 23.6 per cent of GDP and revenues were 25.8 per cent. On a radio program today, the shadow Treasurer was asked about the 7 per cent of GDP and $30 billion which I had said a day or two earlier had been given to the private sector to invest:</PARA>
<PARA>Reith: Well, he will never tell us how he worked out that $30 billion, you know, because it is just a figure plucked from thin air.</PARA>
<PARA>The deceit of that answer! We have taken outlays down from 30 per cent of GDP to just under 24 per cent-23.6 per cent. GDP is running in the order of $400 billion. Seven per cent of that is $28 billion-in round figures, $30 billion. That is where the number came from, as he well knows, with his dishonest answers.</PARA>

<PARA>Whilst everyone has been going well, we have been going backwards.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, between 1986 and 1990 the following cumulative GDP increases were recorded: Japan, 23 per cent; Australia, 16 per cent; Germany, 14 per cent; Italy, 14 per cent; the United Kingdom, 14 per cent; Canada, 13 per cent; the United States, 12 per cent; and France, 11 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the House that, unlike Mr Murray, I will not be giving an opinion; I will outline a process. I think that is the point of the exercise. What has happened is that currently there is under way a process which has been agreed to by the New South Wales Government, as well as by the Commonwealth Government-and I understand also by the Opposition-the Victorian Government and every other environment Minister in this country to try to find a site for a high temperature incinerator. The process under way is laid down in the New South Wales legislation, whereby we will do an environmental assessment on seven selected sites. The process will be conducted by an independent panel of four people. The four people are: Professor Charles Kerr, who is Professor of Preventative and Social Medicine at Sydney University; Wendy McArthey, the Executive Director of the National Trust of Australia; Dr Ben Salinger, from the Department of Chemistry at the Australian National University, and Michael Davidson, former President of the National Farmers Federation. Those four people are there to oversee the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first part of that process is to examine the technical aspects of the seven sites. One of the other parts of the process is also to look at the whole concept of high temperature incineration and assess the concept of storage versus incineration. It is unfortunate that Mr Wal Murray has commented about the site; it just happens that some of the sites selected are in his electorate. On the other hand, Mr Murray has said that he does not object to the concept of an incinerator; he just objects to it being in his electorate. He is also, as Leader of the National Party in New South Wales, part and parcel of the process-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question the honourable gentleman asked is a general one. It does reflect a very important matter, particularly during this situation of farm downturn. On a number of occasions in the last few months I have commented on the desirability of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and State governments and between all people involved in handling the rural crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to farm financial matters, for instance, there are many parties involved. The Commonwealth Government has a responsibility, which it is discharging through managing the economy so as to get sustainable reductions in interest rates and also by providing targeted money through the rural adjustment scheme for the individual farmers in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> The banks also have a responsibility. Last month when I announced the increase in funds for the rural adjustment scheme I stressed the importance of the banks doing what they could to help in the present circumstances. When I spoke with the banks recently they said they would certainly involve themselves very much with the State rural adjustment authorities and also with the farm counselling service. The banks have exhibited an indication that they will be flexible, and I would hope that they would be very sympathetic to individual clients because the rural sector has an enormous capacity to recover. We know the year ahead, particularly for wool, is going to be very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA> The State governments are also involved because of their capacity to provide assistance for farm families which are financially strapped and through their ability to match carryon loans under part B of the rural adjustment scheme. The Queensland and South Australian governments have been very sympathetic in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> Advisers such as accountants, rural counsellors and extension agents are involved because of the importance of farmers having access to the best financial advice and skills possible.</PARA>
<PARA> After I announced the rural adjustment scheme package last month, I was critical of the reception given to it by some State farm organisations. On the one hand, the New South Wales farmers, for example, seemed intent on marginalising themselves by saying things which were just plainly wrong as well as politically motivated. Their attitude was not constructive, nor was it informative. On the other hand, the approach of the National Farmers Federation has been professional, positive and broad ranging. The National Farmers Federation can be proud of the fact that it has succeeded in helping get farmers to understand macro-economics, international trade, micro-economic reform and soil conservation. All these topics are now well and truly on the agendas of farm organisations and, therefore, on the agendas of so many individual farmers. I think there is a proper understanding that these are matters which really count for farmers and farm incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> Slowly it is starting to dawn on people-certainly not on the National Party of Australia-that there needs to be a proper understanding that it is analysis and ideas which really count. Lobbying, of course, is still very active, and we understand that. But it is ideas more than simply trying to exercise numbers, or some of the crude thuggery, that we often see exhibited with some of the farm organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> I do give credit to the National Farmers Federation because it is concentrating more and more on ideas. I was pleased to see even Mr Mac Drysdale, the incoming chairperson of the Wool Corporation, saying it is ideas that count a lot more rather than crude politics.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet, I might pay credit to the outgoing President of the National Farmers Federation. John Allwright has succeeded in continuing to make the National Farmers Federation an adornment to rural politics rather than carrying on some of the stupidity that the National Party has inculcated and encouraged in farm organisations for so many years to the detriment of farmers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable gentleman had been listening to the answers that have been given by myself and the Treasurer, he would have understood that fundamental changes have been initiated over this period of office that will mean that the Australian economy is going to be significantly more competitive in the future. The figures that I gave and that the Treasurer supplemented in regard to the enormous growth in manufactured exports would show that the changes that are necessary to make Australia more competitive have in fact occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer to some statistics that I have with me. I suppose they are not reliable enough because they only come from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)! I refer to a table which covers the period 1985 to 1989, which takes in the period that we are talking about-and these are the latest available statistics-and which relates to manufacturing employment, production and exports over this period.</PARA>
<PARA> For the OECD as a whole, between 1985 and 1989 manufacturing employment increased by one per cent-it went from 100 to 101. For Australia the index moved from 100 to 109. On a quick inspection, I think there was only one country which had a higher growth in manufacturing employment in that period and that was Spain, where the index went from 100 to 113. So there we have it. In terms of manufacturing employment in this period, the OECD was up by one per cent and Australia was up by 9 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA> I now turn to the volume of exports, which goes right to the heart of the question that was addressed to me: what fundamental changes are happening in regard to Australia's capacity to be a competitor in an increasingly competitive world? This is what happened in regard to export volumes. For the OECD as a whole, the index went from 100 in 1985 to 131-that is, a 31 per cent increase. For Australia the index went from 100 to 179. In terms of the exports of manufactured goods, against an OECD average of 31 per cent we went up to 79 per cent. Again, on a quick inspection one finds that only one country in the OECD had a better performance, and that was the United States which pipped us by 2 per cent. The United States went from 100 to 181.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Opposition is trying to write Australia down. It does not want to acknowledge the enormous performance gains made by Australia-better than almost any other country in the OECD-in terms of the volume of exports of manufactured goods. What it should be doing is clapping and applauding that its country has done better than any other country in the OECD. If Opposition members were concerned about their country they would not be trying to play it down. They would say that it was a marvellous thing that only one country in the OECD-the United States-had done better than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I can say from this side of the House that we in government take pride in the fact that the great changes that we have overseen in this country have enabled Australia to do better than any other country, other than the United States. If honourable members opposite want to go on in the next two years trying to write their country down in the way they are doing now, they will pay the price, and it will be a deadly price that they will pay in two years time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fraser for his question and place on record his continuing and close interest and involvement in this important issue. The Snowy Mountains scheme, as honourable members will be aware, is internationally regarded-and properly so-as an engineering masterpiece and as something that represents Australia's best endeavours. More than 100,000 people, coming from over 30 countries, contributed to its construction. In scale and vision in this country it has been matched only by the North West Shelf project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme is governed by the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric agreement, under which it operates as a joint venture arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Victoria. In recent years it has become increasingly evident that existing arrangements have major deficiencies; consequently, the aim of the review is to put in place new arrangements which will improve the efficiency of the scheme, simplify and modernise management and institutional structures and provide for a proper rate of return on the scheme's assets.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth believes, as the Snowy Mountains scheme provides around 30 per cent of the ACT's electricity, that the ACT should be involved in the review process. However, the Snowy Mountains agreement cannot be changed without the concurrence of all three parties, and the governments of New South Wales and Victoria have consistently refused to allow the ACT to become involved in the review process. Under the existing constitutional arrangements, unless both New South Wales and Victoria change their position-and that is most unlikely, in my view-regrettably it is not possible for the ACT to be directly involved.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the honourable member's question, until a reform package is decided, it is only speculation, of course, as to whether ACT electricity prices will rise. However, I should stress that under existing arrangements the scheme is almost totally reliant on borrowings for capital expenditure. If the scheme is to maintain its role as Australia's premier provider of environmentally benign peak load power, then on some estimates up to $400m will be needed over the next 20 years to provide for major refurbishment of generating plant and equipment. My preferred view is that these funds should be generated internally from a proper rate of return on funds invested. As I indicated, that is precluded under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Rectifying this will obviously require either increased prices for some constituents in Canberra or increased efficiency. Obviously, to the extent possible, a reliance on the latter-that is, increased efficiency, and I believe there is considerable room for improvement there-will dictate less reliance on increased prices. In the final analysis we probably will be looking at a combination of both. I assure the honourable members for Fraser and Canberra that the Commonwealth will continue to ensure that the ACT's interests are recognised in the negotiations and that the ACT is consulted on changes resulting from the review.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think everyone in the House would agree that an important scheme such as the Snowy, with the massive investment that the Australian people have placed in it, does require a commitment by everyone to ensure that over time the necessary refurbishment takes place to ensure that the Snowy goes into the next century as an important entity in its own right and, perhaps even more importantly, as possibly a central component of the emerging developments in terms of the national electricity grid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the question asked by the Leader of the National Party, I simply say-if he is asking a question about social divisiveness-that there has been no point in the postwar history of this country when there was greater social divisiveness in Australia than in 1983. This country, after seven years of conservative government, had been reduced to a situation where there was no sense of social or economic cohesiveness. Those opposite had abandoned any system, any concept, of trying to have a sensible wages outcome which could result from discussions between employers and trade unions and government. They set themselves against workers and they set workers against employers and employers against workers. They had an 18 per cent blow-out, which was the worst we had seen in that period, and they had Australian set against Australian. There was never any period in the postwar history of this country of greater social divisiveness than that period over which they presided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We came into government, we called the summit in 1983 and, for the first time in the history of this country, we brought employers and workers together. As a result of that, the country has produced a situation under that unprecedented era of cooperation where these things have happened, which members opposite could not have even dreamed about, let alone start to produce-an 11 per cent reduction in real unit labour cost-because people were not at one another's throat.</PARA>
<PARA> Employers, trade unions and government were sitting down together and working. Those opposite had a situation where there was a pitifully low profit division in this country and, because the trade unions were sitting down cooperatively working with employers and governments, there was a shift from wages to profits-something that those opposite could not engineer because they had set workers against their employers, one against the other and governments against the lot of them.</PARA>
<PARA> We changed that. We now have a position which can be tested by a fairly well known criterion, the level of industrial disputation, which is not a bad sort of indicator as to what sort of degree of cohesiveness is in the country. Members opposite brought industrial disputation under their Government to unheard of levels. Under my Government, industrial disputation has been reduced by 60 per cent compared to the period when members opposite were in office. So, whatever criterion is looked at, I will tell those opposite how socially cohesive they were when in office.</PARA>

He also indicated that assistance to the textile and footwear industries would continue. Is the Prime Minister aware that there are now 2,500 persons who have lost their jobs in the automobile industry in the Geelong region and in excess of 2,000 in the textile, footwear and clothing industries in the two months since the March statement? When can I and the people of Geelong expect positive announcements on the proposals contained in the statement for assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. The Government recognises the extent to which regions like Geelong have been affected by the downturn in the economy. As part of the 12 March statement, my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John Dawkins, announced a comprehensive package, as the honourable member for Corio will recall, to ease the effect of the recession on the labour market, and a number of options for providing help to those workers whose employment is affected by continuing structural change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of these, the measures most relevant are an expansion of the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, the introduction of the passenger motor vehicle labour adjustment package, the introduction of the training and skills task package and the Jobskills program. The Office of Labour Market Adjustment has been expanded with the primary objective of improving the employment futures of the individuals, the regions and the industries affected by structural change.</PARA>
<PARA> A package of assistance, I can say to the honourable member, is currently being developed specifically for the Geelong region. An initial element of assistance was approved in mid-February 1991 for the training of retrenchees and unemployed for placement at Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd (ASTA) at a cost of $300,000. Further elements of assistance are being developed through extensive community consultation with a view to that package being finalised in June of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The passenger motor vehicle labour adjustment package was introduced retrospectively from 1 February 1991. It replaces the previous package of assistance to the industry under the labour adjustment training arrangements, and it provides immediate assistance to retrenchees from the major plan producers and component manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to $40m has been allocated for the passenger motor vehicle labour adjustment program for the period from 1 February this year to 31 December 2000. There has already been some take-up under the package, and an increasing number of participants are expected to be assisted over the next two months.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a labour adjustment package already exists for workers affected by reductions and assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The adequacy of that package in assisting displaced workers is presently under review. However, displaced workers can continue to access the package during the review period, and under present arrangements $50m was allocated to the package to assist adjustments to 1995. The training and skills program-that is, TASK-also announced, is designed to assist the employment and retention and to improve the skills base of employees who would otherwise be retrenched.</PARA>
<PARA> Under TASK, assistance will be provided to companies from 1 July 1991 for these purposes: the development and delivery of a training package for the affected employees, with a contribution towards a training wage which will be paid to employees while they are participating in training. Consultations and negotiations on this matter are currently being carried out with the peak union and employer bodies. The sum of $15m has been allocated to the program in 1991-92, rising to $25m in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA> While I would say to the honourable gentleman that the program will not formally commence until 1 July, negotiations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and peak employers on the concept of the training wage and the administrative arrangements for the program are well advanced, and consultation in regions such as Geelong are currently being undertaken to identify enterprises with potential for assistance from that date.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the new work experience and training program, Jobskills, is also timed for 1 July of this year. Negotiations with unions and employers about the level of the proposed training wage are currently being conducted, and further consultations will be held with individual State and local government authorities, the Skillshare projects and other organisations which have the capacity to implement job skills. May I conclude by saying to the honourable gentleman that as soon as the industrial, administrative and program delivery arrangements are formalised, placements will commence under the program.</PARA>

By way of substantiating the virtue and the merit of what we can offer, it is very relevant to point out that this is substantially different from what the honourable member's Party has not only done in the past but what its principles still are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What those opposite did was create record unemployment. But instead in that situation of having some compassion for those that they threw out of work, they deliberately reduced in real terms the benefits that would be available to them. Let me remind the House again of precisely what the philosophy of those opposite is in regard to this matter. In the period in which the coalition was in office before, leading up to those record levels of unemployment, what did it do in regard to people who depended upon it in government to be looked after in times of difficulty? I will go through the list. This does not just apply to those who are unemployed-and looking up at the ceiling will not save honourable members opposite from their sins because this is a matter of record.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us also look at the position of the sole parent with two kids. What did those opposite do? I will tell them how compassionate they were for that most disadvantaged category of society. They reduced the real value of the benefit by 4 per cent. This Government has increased it by 32 per cent in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said the other day, what did they do for the married pensioner with two kids? Their concept of compassion was to do this: to deliberately reduce the real value of their benefit by 2 per cent in real terms. That is what their concept of compassion was. I will tell honourable members opposite what our concept of compassion is: it has been to increase the real value by 26 per cent. Those opposite reduced it by 2 per cent; we have put it up by 26 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> What was the concept of compassion by those opposite for the unemployed single adult? I will tell them what it was-to reduce the benefit by 19 per cent in real terms. That was their concept of compassion. Our concept of compassion for that person renting privately has been to increase the real benefit by 54 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> What was the concept of compassion of honourable members opposite for the single pensioner? It was to reduce the real benefit by 2 per cent. Our concept of compassion has been to increase it in real terms by 21 per cent. What about the married pensioner couple with no dependants? The Opposition's concept of compassion was to reduce it by 2 per cent in real terms; our concept of compassion is to increase it by 18 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> So if the honourable member wants to know what the difference is between the philosophy of his Party and the philosophy of this Government, he will find it stark and clear-not only did his Party create the record levels of unemployment but also it kicked people in the guts by reducing the real value of benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> That represents not only the policy of the Opposition, but also its philosophy. As far as this side of politics is concerned, we are different in terms of policy because we are different in terms of philosophy. Our philosophy is that, if people in the community become disadvantaged through no fault of their own, then the community will increase the real benefits available to them. That is what we have done; that is what we will continue to do. When the time comes to be judged in 1993, I will go down to Isaacs with the honourable member opposite and he will get rolled.</PARA>

Diversity programs shown by licensees included social documentaries, new concept programs, news and current affairs, specials and variety. This was in addition to a range of Australian drama and children's drama.

<PARA> That this House censures the Prime Minister for his lack of leadership and failure in economic policy which has put a million Australians out of work, sent thousands of businesses broke and pushed Australia five years further down the road to a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very serious matter when the Opposition decides to move a censure motion in relation to the Prime Minister. In the course of Question Time today we have had a disgraceful attempt by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to fob off the Government's failure over the last five years to hear the very clear warning that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave this country, quite correctly, in May 1986, just five years ago today. The great tragedy of the last five years is that, in a sense, 14 May 1986 was the Treasurer's finest hour. </PARA>
<PARA> He had created in that statement a unique opportunity to focus the minds of the Government and of the people of Australia on the magnitude of our economic problems. So, for that particular reason, it is a significant tragedy that there has been a fundamental failure of leadership since that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, he created a unique opportunity to build a constituency for change, which is very difficult, as we know, in this country. We get very few opportunities to get the attention of the electorate as to the magnitude of the problem and to build a constituency-which emerged from that statement-to make substantial change. The fact that that warning was not heeded has seen our country now slide, through bad economic management and appalling leadership, into the worst recession in 60 years. As we saw today in the Parliament, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have got absolutely no concept of the pain and hardship being felt by average Australians today. </PARA>
<PARA> They got up in the House sequentially-the Treasurer's pride somewhat hurt that he was not able to get the call first-and listed a whole string of boring statistics, selectively quoted, to try to demonstrate that they had not failed in economic management in the course of the last five years. As we go through the statistics that both of them listed, it is very easy to knock over their case. They picked, for example, underlying rates of inflation rather than the actual rate of inflation and forgot to mention why inflation would not fall in the midst of the deepest recession in 60 years. One would be appalled if it did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said that he had created three-quarters of a million jobs, but they are on the way out. We now have 844,000 people unemployed. On the Commonwealth Employment Service basis, one million people are looking for work, and upwards of one million other people have been pushed onto some other sort of benefit or are unable to work more than 15 hours a week. He selectively quoted data on the balance of payments, but forgot to mention the fact that the current account deficit has increased from about $12 billion to about $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Treasurer that it really does not matter that the trade account has started to improve in the midst of the deepest recession in 60 years because the country is now locked in a debt trap; it is deeply in a debt trap where the great bulk of this year's current account deficit is going to be paying interest on the accumulated deficits of the past several years. </PARA>
<PARA> So we can go on through all the statistics that both of them quoted, many of them deliberately misrepresented, talking about investment booms which no longer survive. Indeed, we are looking at the first significant fall in our capital stock on record in the course of this year, focusing attention on micro reform, for which they were unable to document or provide the detail of that significant shift, so there was very selectively quoted data to substantiate their case. </PARA>
<PARA> But the most disturbing thing is that the Prime Minister, when subject to interjection and so on from our side in the course of Question Time today, turned on us and used the last refuge of the scoundrel-patriotism. He turned on us and said that we were talking our country down. It is not a question of talking our country down, Prime Minister; it is a question of facing reality before Australia is finally written off. It is not a question of talking our country down. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of 14 May 1986 is that, on the one occasion when the Treasurer got it right, nobody in the Government listened to him. The Government has pushed Australians now into the worst recession they have seen in the course of 60 years. It is for that reason that we feel it is fundamentally important to bring the Prime Minister to account for his Government's negligence and incompetence in meeting the challenge which his Treasurer identified back in early 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, I think it is important for us on this side of the House to start to voice the mood of disillusionment and the mood of anger that exist out there in Australia as the people of Australia struggle in the circumstances that have been created by the Government's incompetence and neglect. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is fundamentally important that we try to bring the Prime Minister back to reality, make him understand the magnitude of our problems, the hard choices and the leadership required in order to turn our country around. He has shown no capacity for leadership in the course of the past five years, and he has shown a particularly appalling lack of capacity for leadership since the last election. If we look back over those five years, we find that he and his Government had a significant number of opportunities to put into place the correct policies: five Budgets, four mini-Budgets, one major industry statement, six Premiers Conferences and a host of other policy statements--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-And summits. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And summits, talkfests, reviews, consultations and processes of advice. None of these things has led to this Government either facing reality or starting to take the decisions required to turn our country around. The Prime Minister worries, as we have heard on many occasions and as recently as yesterday, about his place in history. His real place in history will be to record the fact that he wasted the past five years and wasted the real opportunity created by his Treasurer to put our country on the path to improved international standing, improved status in terms of living standards, our credit rating and our significance in this region and the rest of the world, but he chose instead, by neglect and incompetence, to push us down the Argentinean road. We are now five years further down that road than otherwise would have been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many examples of this Prime Minister's lack of leadership, but perhaps the most telling example is the fact that he will not face the reality of the failures of his Treasurer. Anybody else in any other position in this country performing the way the Treasurer has performed in the course of the past five years would have been given his marching orders a long time ago. The Prime Minister cannot understand that, but the people of Australia cannot understand how it is that he sits there and applauds the Treasurer and talks about his beautiful performance while neglecting the fact that he has inflicted more pain and hardship on the average Australian than any other Treasurer in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has allowed the Treasurer to get away with constant breaches of Cabinet solidarity in terms of attacking his colleagues; the Prime Minister has allowed the Treasurer to wander all over the place, undermining him; the Prime Minister has shown an appalling lack of leadership in dealing with the Treasurer and in not being able to bring either his front bench or his back bench under control; and on any policy issue these days, as it emerges, the Prime Minister has as many views as there are people on his side of the Parliament, openly speaking to the gallery and to whoever will listen to him about his particular views on policy. However, most importantly, the Prime Minister has shown an appalling lack of understanding of what is in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> How is it that, in the midst of the worst crisis for 60 years, the Prime Minister can play politics with projects such as Coronation Hill or Wesley Vale? How is it that the Prime Minister can say that he is reforming telecommunications while he is protecting the monopolistic-based, featherbedded jobs of his mates in Telecom? How is it that the Prime Minister can claim he is cleaning up the waterfront and has embarked on a major program of waterfront reform when he is really only protecting his mates in the union leadership and in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has shown only one capacity in terms of Government in the past five years: looking after his mates. The Prime Minister has put mateship above leadership to the point where it has become a national disgrace and embarrassment. The best example I can give the House of that is the Prime Minister's performance over several weeks in relation to his mate Brian Burke. When everyone else in the country could see that Brian Burke had to go-and even Brian Burke in his moment of disgrace had a better concept of what was right than the Prime Minister did-the Prime Minister could not bring himself to show the leadership which is essential to turn our country around: the Prime Minister preferred to stand by mateship. It only begs the question: what hold does Brian Burke have over the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have seen wasted years in terms of the rhetoric this man has embarked on and the failure to deliver action. We can go back to the Prime Minister's war address to the nation of 11 June 1986, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will not shirk the hard decisions that are necessary to ensure a bright future for us and for our children. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister should go and tell that to the one million people who are unemployed today; he should tell that to the 800,000 babies who have been born in the past five years, or to the more than 500,000 migrants who have arrived in the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I was walking through the Doncaster shopping centre in Melbourne. A woman stopped me and identified herself as a migrant of the Menzies period. She said, `Do you know, if I arrived today I would get back on the next boat and go home'. She begged me to do what we could to get rid of `those two wonderful characters, Hawke and Keating'. That is the feeling which exists in large parts of the migrant community today. The migrants came here to build a country and to build an opportunity for their children, which they now cannot guarantee their children. They are very concerned about the future of their children and their children's children. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years alone, the bottom line of the Prime Minister's economic incompetence has been that our debt levels internationally have risen from about $92 billion to $165 billion. The Prime Minister has knowingly mortgaged the future of those children as a result of the incompetence of his economic management. All through the last five years we have been subjected to a barrage, as we were again today, of rhetoric about how the Prime Minister can take the tough decisions. Yet we cannot identify one tough decision the Prime Minister has taken in the course of the last five years. The bottom line is that debt keeps going up. Pain and hardship for the average Australian reflects the fact that the Prime Minister cannot take the decisions required to turn this country around. </PARA>
<PARA> The third disturbing feature of the wasted years is the fact that this economic crisis was not inevitable. This economic crisis could have been avoided. This is an economic crisis of this Government's own making. It cannot be blamed on what happened in the rest of the world. It cannot be blamed on anybody else. We slate the blame directly to the Prime Minister and to his Treasurer, who were in full control of the economic circumstances over the last five years. We look back over those five years at how they consistently misread the economic circumstances or tried to manipulate the economic circumstances for political ends. The combination of those two things has created the fundamental mess that we today observe in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer missed, for example, the significance of the pick-up in the terms of trade in December 1986. They then played politics in 1987 and 1988 by trying to force interest rates down in the run-up to the Federal election and the New South Wales election in early 1988. They then reluctantly saw that they had to do something. They chose one instrument to do it: interest rates. And that blunt instrument was the principal source of the recession that they imposed over and above all the structural problems the Treasurer was talking about back in early 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a crisis in this country in terms of expectations and it is a crisis of confidence. People have been consistently told that things are better than they are. The Government has never once had the courage to tell the truth about the nature of our circumstances and the direction in which we were going. Now it has driven those people to a state of total despair. </PARA>
<PARA> The lucky country is now the frustrated and angry country as a consequence of the Prime Minister's gross incompetence and lack of leadership. For the first time we are looking at the possibility of the current generation of Australians leaving a lower standard of living to their children than they themselves enjoyed, and that is what concerns people. That is what concerns people in the rest of this country, beyond the confines of this place and the artificiality of Canberra. They understand the magnitude of the problems that have been imposed upon them by this Government's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, every time the Government is pressured-the Treasurer and the Prime Minister-for reasons or for explanations as to why things have happened, we just get a barrage of excuses. We get a barrage of irrelevant excuses and broken promises. The Prime Minister talks in the past. In answer to almost every question today he referred back to the Fraser years. We are eight years on from the Fraser years. There is no reason to live in the past. The people of Australia want the Prime Minister to look to the future. The people cannot understand why he always lives in the past or why he boasts about the fact that he created l 1/2 million jobs. The people all know that he borrowed the money to do that. Any fool can create jobs by borrowing money to the extent of about $70,000 per job. With the average wage at about $25,000 to $30,000, it would have been cheaper to give the people the money than to run up that much debt in order to create those jobs. Any fool can do that. The people know that in doing that, and in boasting about that, the Prime Minister has mortgaged the future of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister makes these artificial comparisons of the social wage and the benefits that were given under the Fraser years compared with those given under this Prime Minister. And he attacks us for a lack of compassion. There is nothing that reveals a lack of compassion more than the way the Prime Minister has mismanaged the economy in the course of the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing more compassionate that one can do for people in Australia than to give them a job; to create the opportunity for them to have a job, to better themselves and raise their standard of living and give their children a better standard of living than they have enjoyed. The Prime Minister talks about compassion and goes away and plays games with environmental and resource issues, immersing them in a pile of red tape, green tape and black tape. The Prime Minister does not understand. </PARA>

None of those projects will get off the ground because of what he is making light of-red tape, green tape and black tape. He cannot even take a soft option decision, such as the one on Coronation Hill. Yet he prides himself on being able to take tough decisions in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are left with is a government that is riddled with division, a government which has no sense of direction and no vision for the future. We are left with a Prime Minister that looks only to the past; he lives in the past and pretends that none of the current problems exist. The Prime Minister has persistently put mateship over leadership in everything he has done. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Prime Minister should start answering some questions for average Australians. He should start telling the 844,000 people who have lost their job when they can expect to get another one. That is a reasonable question on the part of those people who are now desperately concerned that they are perhaps looking at an economy which is locked into over 10 per cent unemployment for years to come. The Prime Minister should tell some of the small business people in Australia when they can expect to recoup their savings and their wealth which he stripped off them through high interest rates and the collapse of those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the farmers who are in the worst rural crisis since the 1930s? They want the Prime Minister to show a bit of genuine compassion and deal with the structural problems that have been impacting on their industry and the impact of high interest rates and uncompetitive exchange rates that have reduced the earnings of farmers all over Australia and are now pushing tens, if not hundreds, of farmers off their farms in the course of every single week. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the miners that the Prime Minister mocked when I raised the point about red tape, green tape and black tape? They are all genuinely concerned that they will not be able to develop their businesses much more than they have, that they will not be able to initiate new projects. When the country desperately needs to boost its export potential, what does the Prime Minister do? He ties up all those projects in any area instead of having the courage to take the decisions that are required. </PARA>

Not once in this place has he told the House, let alone Hayden Slater, what this Opposition and this Opposition Leader would do differently from this Government, other than this: he says that he would have kept interest rates higher and for longer. I hope he will have the honesty to tell Hayden Slater that in those circumstances he would be looking to a situation of deeper and more prolonged recession under the leadership of this country, if he were ever in that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speech of the Leader of the Opposition was riddled with hypocrisy. Let me start from the beginning. He said that I and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had produced a string of boring statistics. He let us know that he was going to demolish immediately this string of boring statistics. As one can imagine, I sat here in trepidation, waiting for this attack upon my string of boring statistics. What was the attack? He said, `Let's look at inflation'. What did he say then? He said, `Look at inflation; yes, it has come down'. His words were: `Wouldn't it be amazing if inflation didn't fall in a recession? Wouldn't it be appalling? You would expect inflation to fall in a recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very interesting attack upon my statistic. I regret very much having to go back in history, because I know that the Leader of the Opposition does not like it, but perhaps he will recall what happened in 1982-83. There was a recession then. It was the worst since 1930. What happened to inflation? Of course, we would expect inflation to fall in a recession. The Leader of the Opposition just said so, so it must be true. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened in that recession? Inflation did not fall. It went up to 11.2 per cent. What is he talking about-this so-called professor of economics, who says that it is absolutely inevitable that in a recession inflation must fall? The visiting professor said so; it must be true. The visiting professor should look up the statistics of his own recession, the one in which he guided the conservative government. That government was absolutely unique, as we have said before. It did what no other government had ever done before. It simultaneously produced double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the professor? Why is his statement true? Why must it inevitably be the case that inflation falls in a recession? If it is inevitably true, why did it not happen in his recession? Is it just that he is totally incompetent or has he had a convenient bout of amnesia? The fact that he will not face up to is that he had simultaneous double digit unemployment and double digit inflation because he had no idea of how to run a wages policy in this country. He walked away from trying to get some acceptable aggregate outcome in wages, and so he had an 18 per cent blow-out in wages. That is why it is not inevitable that in a recession there will be falling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Leader of the Opposition is again as comprehensibly incompetent as he proved himself to be when he had an opportunity to have a hand in running the Australian economy, he, and only he, in the history of this country, will produce at one and the same time double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. He was the guiding hand in that and he has the temerity now, eight years later, to stand up and say, `Please give me back control to do the same things I did before'. He must be a joke. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on from that performance to talk about the question of courage in decision taking. I would like to quote to Professor Hewson his own words on this matter of respective political courage between me and my colleagues and the conservatives. I want to share with the House these words of Professor Hewson. I will quote Professor Hewson-as he was then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would the honourable member for Flinders like to hear what the Leader of the Opposition had to say?  He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The assets test on pensions and the lump-sum superannuation decisions are fundamentally sound decisions, economically . . . They are the sort of decisions that a conservative government may want to introduce but may not have the courage to. </PARA>
<PARA>How do honourable members like that? There is the analysis by the then Professor Hewson, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, when he was analysing the nature of politics in this country. I repeat his remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>The assets test on pensions and the lump-sum superannuation decisions are fundamentally sound decisions, economically . . . They are the sort of decisions that a conservative government may want to introduce but may not have the courage to. </PARA>
<PARA>It gets better. The current Leader of the Opposition went on:</PARA>
<PARA>In such circumstances, presumably, it is better to let the other guys take the political flak for taking these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>This man gets up and talks about political courage. He says, `Name one tough decision you have taken'. I will name tough decisions until he gets sick of hearing them. I will start with the assets test. It was a correct decision but one which the Opposition ran away from; it conducted a most vicious campaign around this country. I will talk about the fringe benefits test. </PARA>
<PARA> Going from great things like that, I will come to the period in which he has been Leader of the Opposition. We will find out about the massive reserves of courage with which he has been so uniquely endowed. On a great big fiscal decision about a charge at the Australian War Memorial, he had a call from Beryl Beaurepaire. She decided, in a context where she was totally satisfied with the decision this Government had made about the allocation of money, that she wanted to do some more things at the War Memorial. She decided that she would impose a rather modest charge. She spoke to the responsible Minister, who said, `Well, yes, that is okay'. She said, `Well, I'm talking to the Opposition'. She talked to Dr Hewson. She raised it with him. He said, `Yes, that's all right'. Dame Beryl said, `Should I talk to Senator Newman?'. `No', says this courageous leader, `Leave Jocelyn to me. That will be all right'. `Leave Jocelyn to me'-indeed!</PARA>
<PARA> What happened? Captain Courageous walks into the joint party room and he is not heard from. There is not a `boo' from him. He is rolled by Jocelyn Newman. And he has the hide to get up here and talk about courage! If he does not have the courage to stand up to Jocelyn Newman in the joint party room on a small charge for the War Memorial, what chance will he have of being any different from the people in the conservative party that he so properly analysed?</PARA>
<PARA> He has never had the courage to take a tough decision. Let us look at some examples. These will be related to the tough decisions that I have taken with my colleagues. What about the question of tariffs? When the coalition was in office, it kept those high tariff walls, which was the single most damaging and damning thing it could do for the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I personalise my remarks only because the Leader of the Opposition personalised the censure motion. Tariffs were not reduced until I came along with my string of able colleagues and we said, `That's not good enough'. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks it was easy to reduce the tariffs, he should have another think, because arrayed against me and my colleagues I had the serried ranks of a whole range of employers-not all of them, because some of them have learnt better than the Leader of the Opposition-a lot of the trade unions and a lot of community organisations. I had mayor after mayor coming to me, saying, `No, no, no'. Trade unions, employers and civic leaders-the whole ranks of them-were saying, `Don't do it'. But we knew that it was the right thing to do and we had the courage to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, on this question of leadership, let me quote the Leader of the Opposition. I will show what little substance this man has and what a hollow man he is. On 28 April this year he was doorstopped. He has to be doorstopped; he is not too keen on having full press conferences, I tell you. One has to be quick to catch him. In a doorstop on 28 April, in relation to the waterfront issue, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA>What we need is the Prime Minister to show some leadership . . . the sooner the Prime Minister shows that kind of leadership . . . he's got to provide some leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>Specifically, he was demanding that I show some leadership by ensuring genuine enterprise bargaining on the waterfront. Normally, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker-and you have known me very well over a long period of time-modesty would prevent me from taking that further. But on this occasion I have to do a little quoting. As you know, Mr Speaker, two or three days after that challenge to my leadership to do something about waterfront reform, I spent a few hours on this issue. Afterwards a journalist asked a question of Captain Setchell, who is not normally well known as being one of our supporters. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>As a captain, you must be used to giving orders. What was it like to be taking orders from Mr Hawke?</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I am reluctant to say this. Captain Setchell's answer was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that he demonstrated to us the leadership qualities that he truly has. I think he was quite remarkable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After that shrill and excitable performance from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) it is no wonder that his own back bench members are literally and openly in the corridors of this place saying that it is time he went. If ever I saw a performance from a bloke whose career was a swinging carcass, I have just seen it from Bob. Talk about a man under siege, a man under pressure! We would never know from that pathetic performance that the motion before the House today concerned the rising level of unemployment. He barely addressed the basis of the censure motion. I will read it out to him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House censures the Prime Minister for his lack of leadership and failure in economic policy which has put a million Australians out of work, sent thousands of businesses broke and pushed Australia five years further down the road to a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an open and shut case. Go back five years. Was it not entertaining to hear the Treasurer (Mr Keating) rewriting history about what he said in 1986? Let us go back to 1986. The significance of the anniversary of the Treasurer's banana republic statement five years ago is simply that he has failed his own test-not a test that we established, not a test established by some economic commentators or by business or by his own Party, but a test that he himself established. He was the one, with the Prime Minister, who established the height at which the high-jump bar would be set. Five years ago today marks that failure of his very own test. </PARA>
<PARA> In that whole time in the last five years we have had nothing but deception from the Government as to the state of the economy. One aspect of the leadership that we rightfully look to a Prime Minister to provide is some leadership as to a realistic assessment of the Australian economy. Back in September 1987 this Treasurer had the audacity to say that this was the great coming of age of Australia. A year later, in the 1988 mini-Budget, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have acted decisively to turn the situation around. </PARA>
<PARA>Remember this one? In August 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the one which brings home the bacon. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year, when referring to the 1990 Budget, he said that these were definitely the golden years of change. I went back to the debate that we had this day 12 months ago to see what the Treasurer was saying. How revealing it is. Year in, year out, he deceives people about the state of the economy. This is classic Keatingese. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Flinders now has the indecency to talk about a slowdown in the economy as though it were a deep recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words come back to haunt the Treasurer, as well they might. Australia is not heading towards a recovery; we are heading towards a depression. We are not a banana republic. This is basically a good country. We have good people, we have good natural resources, and we have a stable political system. But the truth is that the economic fabric, the economic structure, of this country is literally wasting away in front of our very eyes. I do not use that word `depression' lightly. It is a matter of balance between the importance of telling people the truth about the economy and giving people a realistic assessment of the economy and the danger of a sense of doom and gloom becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot avoid a sense of apprehension about what is going on in Australia today. By Labor's own words the situation is now worse than it was in 1982 and 1983. Bob Carr, the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales, said that only 10 days ago. The data highlighting an unabated continuation of the recession that has come out in recent days legitimately provides the question as to whether or not Australia is heading for a depression. There is no doubt that Australia is in the grips of the worst recession since the horrific experience of the 1930s. No-one wants to talk the economy down. Accepting the Government's rose-coloured glasses view of the economy does not do anybody any good either. The evidence that is emerging, both statistical and analytical, raises serious concern that the recession Australia is currently experiencing is deep enough for the term `depression' to be at least introduced into the public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is worsening. We should look at the figures from the Business Council of Australia which were released over the weekend. I had a bloke ring me up from Sydney this morning. He said that he had been in business for 40 years. He employed 40 people and they were about to all go out of business and lose their jobs. The images of thousands of people queuing up recently for jobs in Melbourne that were months away ought to remind members of the Government of the desperation of the unemployed in the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the image of the moonlight marches to bring to people's attention the plight of the unemployed in the 1930s is an image which we now see outside some shops in the 1990s. The former Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, has said publicly that it is arguable that Australia is in a depression. Labor MPs use the word `depression' to describe the circumstances in 1982-1990-91 is worse than 1982. Members opposite really know a depression when they see one. When looking back at the situation in 1982, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1982, when the honourable gentleman had interest rates at the level they now are, the economy was in a state of depression. It was at the bottom of its worst depression since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA>If that was the worst, where are we now, Treasurer?</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the Treasurer's own definition, I asked the Prime Minister whether he would countenance the word `depression'-a very simple question-but he skipped away very quickly. However, it was not just the Treasurer-people such as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) referred to 1982 as a depression. The former Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr Hurford, the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, and the former Leader of the Opposition leading the pack back in those times are all on the public record in Hansard describing the economic downturn in 1982 as a depression. If they believed that Australia was experiencing a depression then, why are they so reluctant now to confront the same terminology?</PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of one's view about the general state of the economy, the fact is that some sectors of the Australian economy are in a depression, and it is about time that the Government faced up to it. I refer specifically to Victoria, where the finance rating has been downgraded again, and I refer also to the rural crisis, where hard times for many Australians unfortunately are still ahead of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a short term phenomenon that we face. It is true that many of our problems are chronic, in the sense that we have had them for a long time. I think of the Commonwealth-State relations financial mess. It is no wonder that the States have been big spenders and have acted irresponsibly in recent years, given the way in which Commonwealth financial relations have become established in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said during Question Time that he had made major reforms to the tax system, but he is damned out of his own words because in 1985, he said that, unless we were prepared to introduce a consumption tax as part of an overall package, we would only ever be making peripheral changes to the tax system. He was right then. He had no answer to the need for radical tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1968 this country has had a poor industrial relations system. Since Clarrie O'Shea was let out of gaol in Melbourne, we have had the rule of the jungle in industrial relations. In the areas of waterfront and shipping-in fact, wherever one looks at the Australian economy-the truth of the matter is that our problems are chronic. That is the great thing about the 1986 statement. The Treasurer recognised that our problems were exactly that-chronic. They had been with us for a long time and were building up to exacerbate our economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The charge against the Treasurer and his leader is that they recognised the problem but then sat pat and did nothing about it. They blame everyone else-banks, bishops, business people-but the truth is that they cannot escape their own mouth. When the Treasurer said that this was a recession we had to have, and when he admitted that this was a recession that he deliberately engineered, no-one should have been surprised. In 1986, he actually predicted that, if he were so undisciplined and so disinterested in our salvation, that would be the inevitable consequence. They are the Treasurer's own words. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was right. In a sense, it was the Treasurer's finest hour. What the Treasurer said then was chillingly accurate. He sent shock waves literally through the stock market and used the occasion, rightly, to shock the Australian community into supporting the changes we would need to make. He said that we were too complacent; in that sense, he was right. In a way, I pay him a compliment without reservation. It was a public exhibition of political frankness, a display of honesty that we have rarely seen from the Government side. But, quite frankly, that honesty and frankness were transitory. Those qualities have deserted the Treasurer; his courage has gone, and what is left now is nothing but blind ambition. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years ago the Treasurer honestly set the standard by which the Australian economy should be judged, and he has failed. He knows he has failed but he does not have the courage to face it. For the next couple of years, not only is the Prime Minister the problem but our problem is that, in a sense, he is the solution for the next two years. This country needs a recognition of our problems and some determination to do something about it. As the recession delivers the message of Labor's failures, through rising unemployment, increasingly people look for the answers. There are no simple answers and we make that very clear in our appreciation of today's economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are things that can be done. The Treasurer could start in the next week or so by sending a message to investors that he has some confidence, and they can have some confidence, in the future of this country. He could say yes to Coronation Hill. He could say yes to the Australian tourist industry by supporting the third runway at Sydney airport that has been waiting for years and years-nearly as long as he has been Treasurer-and he could say yes to uranium mining so that we can start to do something about exports. But he needs to go beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a national savings policy. Our problem is that we rely on the savings of foreigners. That is our debt-$160-odd billion in gross terms grown from $90 billion just five years ago. We need radical changes to the tax system. He ought to abolish the capital gains tax. Why? The reason is that we want to give people some incentive to see whether we can drag this country into a recovery. We ought to have a change in the tax system because the Government's tax system taxes people who export. It penalises the very people who provide for this country some opportunity to go for better times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer ought to introduce a goods and services tax because there are still many people who cheat the tax system. There are still many people who are pay-as-you earn (PAYE) taxpayers and who pay more tax-the very people the Government claims to represent have a millstone around their neck as a result of the Government's failure to introduce meaningful tax reform. The Treasurer blames everybody but we never hear him blame the Australian Council of Trade Unions, because they are his co-conspirators in Australia's circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have a very inflexible system with regard to industrial relations. We need voluntary employment agreements. The Government's idea of enterprise bargaining is just mugging enterprises, going around with a shotgun saying to enterprises, `Sign on the bottom line in accordance with the deal that Bill and Paul have worked out'. That is not genuine and the Government knows it. We ought to have genuine enterprise agreements. We ought to have secret ballots before strikes so that union members, the rank and file, can have some say in their unions. Compulsory trade unionism ought to be abolished to give back to people some of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's waterfront reform is clearly not adequate, according to a test not implemented by me but by David White, the Minister in Victoria, a Labor Minister, who said that it was clearly not enough. That applies to shipping and to the Reserve Bank also. Politicians ought to be removed from the printing presses so that we can do something about inflation. We ought to have a decent competitive policy in telecommunications, not the two-telephone policy that the Government has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the fact is that this censure motion is an open and shut case. The Prime Minister is deserving of the strongest censure. The Treasurer put the test in five years: the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have both failed it. At the next election, the Treasurer deserves the censure that the Australian people will deliver to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. It is a sad commentary on Australian public life that a debate of this nature can be keyed off statements that I made five years ago and policies introduced over the period that pointed to the need for structural change in Australia and the difficulties that Australia would face without it; that the Opposition believes that such remarks were significant enough to mount a motion in the Parliament on the anniversary of their having been said; that the contributions of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were rhetorical, empty, free of logic, free of any acknowledgment of change, free of any qualified analysis, free of any positive feature which would point to progress having been made and the need for further progress to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were an Australian person viewing Parliament and watching this debate, one would take a very jaundiced view of our national prospects, whereas in fact this period has been one of vast change in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> An Opposition member- All downhill. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know what the Opposition is saying. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, `We are now headed towards a depression', although I might say that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was reported in these terms on that subject today:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`Australia was not heading for a depression and any comparison with the 1930s was an exaggeration . . . Mr Howard said . . . the economy was nowhere near as bad as in the 1930s . . . the spectre of the 1930s, which was not an accurate picture of the economy.``I don't want to do that because in my heart I don't believe things are as bad as they were in those days''.'. </PARA>
<PARA>I compliment the honourable member for Bennelong for his honesty; he is correct, of course. But of course we had no such honesty from the Leader of the Opposition, who said it was the worst recession in 60 years, or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who said it was a depression. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Treasury Department today to tell me what the unemployment rate in 1991 would be if the March 1983 participation rate applied and, similarly, the unemployment rate in March 1983 if the April 1991 participation rate applied. The answer is that the unemployment rate today, if the March 1983 participation rate applied, would be 5 per cent and the unemployment rate in the time of the former Government in March 1983, if today's participation rate applied, would be 14.7 per cent. I table the document with the assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA> There it is. The Leader of the Opposition said that this is the worst recession in 60 years, but by any measure a simple analysis of participation rates puts the unemployment rate at 15 per cent in 1983 and on the same basis 5 per cent today. So I have demolished that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we had the Leader of the Opposition saying that we were selectively quoting statistics and that for the past five years we had taken no hard decisions. Of course, any observer of Australian public life would know that that was patently untrue. He went on to say that any fool can create jobs. He had nothing to say of the job creation in the period between 1983 and 1990. Then the Deputy Leader said that we had failed our own tests, that it is no wonder the States have acted irresponsibly and that we had no national savings policy. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the sum total of the contribution by the Opposition, whereas the fact of the matter is this: in these years-this is what Australia faces now in the 1990s as distinct from what it faced at the beginning of the 1980s-it has a competitive exchange rate mechanism; it has a structural fiscal surplus in the national budget; it has a high profit share brought about by a change in wage levels and prices; it has a rational tax system which supports income earning businesses with cash flows and does not tax their dividends twice; it has a huge shift to a more educated and trained work force through high retention rates in schools and training; in merchandise exports, it has a shift in the basic productive capacity of the economy, of merchandise exports increasing by 80 per cent between May 1986 and March 1991, of manufactured exports increasing by 178 per cent between May 1986 and March 1991; it has a current account deficit improved by 24 per cent between April 1986 and March 1981, with gross domestic product having risen by 15 per cent over the same period and employment having risen by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We face the 1990s with those things: the competitive exchange rate, the structural Budget surplus, the high profit share, the sensible tax system, the shift to an educated work force, a basic shift to exports and a savings policy underpinning it through occupational superannuation. Those occupational superannuation levels will be five times our national debt in the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> So as we face the 1990s, sure, in cyclical terms we face a recession and we face rising unemployment, but as we face the 1990s we face all those structural things having been changed: a competitive exchange rate, the fiscal surplus, the high profit share, the capacity for higher investment, the further shift to the external sectors away from domestic demand, a more sensible rationing of credit through the banking system and, coming down the back of it, a huge savings pipeline plugged into it through dividend imputation and the equities market. That is what we face. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we face in the 1980s? A recession, as the Prime Minister said, with high inflation-not a recession with low inflation-with profits smashed to pieces, with investment having fallen apart for five or seven years, with no shift to the external sector, with an uncompetitive exchange rate mechanism and no savings policy and a tax system which favoured speculative investment against income producing value added investment. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the structural change we face. It is almost so that nobody can muck it up. As we get back to better prices, on today's export volumes and 1989 terms of trade prices, we would have a stable debt position this very day. If our exports continue to grow, as they have right through the 1980s-and I show honourable members the December quarter balance of payment export line, a continuous line of growth right through the 1980s into the 1990s-as those volumes continue to grow, even without a lift in prices, Australia will stabilise its debt with a low inflation rate, a lower cost of capital and kicking along investment, which is funded by the huge savings pipeline of occupational superannuation. That is what we offer Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Opposition offered? In its barren sterility, what has it ever offered?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All that the Opposition is about is a few negative cases, as shown by the last remark made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Fancy saying, `Get the politicians out of the printing presses of the Reserve Bank'. On the one hand the Opposition says that, having administered the toughest monetary policy in the Organisation for Economic and Cooperative Development countries, we have had high interest rates and have pushed the economy into recession; on the other hand, it says that we have had the politicians with the printing presses. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is absurd. He is stupid and absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the 1990s now, with the competitiveness coming off the exchange rate, with inflation, with a low inflation rate, with a structural budget surplus, with those savings coming into the business community, with the high profit share funding that investment and with the lower cost of capital, and even half-way decent terms of trade, one sees it is game, set and match for Australia. Game, set and match for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong shakes his head. I can cop irrational debate; I can cop it any day of the week. We have just heard two irrational speeches. Frankly the only difficulty for the Government is being around long enough to see it-that is all-not that it will not happen. We recognise the economic difficulties that we are in, but there can be no doubt that Australia will be a low inflation productive country with a huge merchandise trade surplus right through the 1990s, as sure as I stand here. That is what the Liberals want to get their hands on. That is why they want to win the next election, because they may say in their more tawdry moments, and try to dismiss the changes of the middle and the late 1980s, that they want to get their hands on that structure. They want to put their name on the maker's label-on a structure we created. That is what they are about. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Opposition wanted to win the last election and the 1987 one. But the fact of the matter is that the Opposition will not win the next one because it traffics in the pessimism that comes from this kind of circumstance. It traffics and rejoices in that kind of pessimism. But I tell members of the Opposition this: they will eat their hearts out as the inflation rate comes down, as the cost of capital comes down, as the savings build up in superannuation, as the profit share holds, as investment picks up, as export volumes continue to grow as they now do inexorably month after month in a structural way-as that structure comes good for us and for Australia. And as sure as I stand here, it will. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite may think that the times are made for them-that there is a recession. I do not know whether they noticed in today's Economist the position in which Australia is placed in the cycle. That publication has Australia first in and first out of the trough of the recession. Then comes Canada, Sweden, Britain, Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Holland, Germany and Japan. We will be first out; and we will be first out with that structure in place. </PARA>
<PARA> As if those useless people opposite would ever have the wit to put together something of this comprehension and quality. They sat for years with profits falling to pieces, wages all over the place, inflation up, a recession at the same time, merchandised exports dying, and imports surging. This Government was not in office two years before our debt was taken to 32 per cent of gross domestic product because of their ineptitude. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not a solid idea amongst any members on the Opposition front bench. They are waiting like praying mantises to spring the electoral trap and to pick up the structure that the Government has painstakingly put into effect. Well, do not think that our political embarrassment with the recession or the difficulties which the Australian people unhappily face will camouflage what is basically a long term structure for their prosperity into the 1990s. It will not, and that will be apparent to honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite may think, `If only we can be lucky enough to inherit their creativity'. Well, they will not be. We will fight like hell to deny it to them and to claim what is ours-that is, the new economic society of this country created by us. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me conclude on this point: one would have thought that at this moment, when there is a chance to stand back and ask what has happened in the last 5 years, there would have been some acknowledgment of the structural change and some positive elements from the Opposition about Australia's portents. But what did members of the Opposition do? They have made cheap, miserable, hollow political speeches. If one were an outsider looking at the Opposition, one would say, `God help Australia; God help us'. We could all do with God's help but over here we help ourselves as we are helping the nation. The fact is that we will be helping Australia to a more prosperous society into the 1990s on the back of this structural change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifth report of the Committee for 1991, relating to the construction of a purpose built computer centre for the Australian Customs Service, Bruce, Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report I have just tabled proposes the construction of a two-storey structure of approximately 3,780 square metres gross floor area which will provide 1,425 square metres of computer floor space and associated office space, staff amenities, loading dock, storage and plant rooms. The limit of cost estimate for the project is $16.9m at November 1990 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has approved this project but with reservations which relate principally to the location of the proposed building on a site next to a similar facility being built for the Australian Taxation Office and the arrangements for the power supply to the building. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a considerable amount of material dealing with the proposed location of the Customs building next to the Taxation Office building which is currently under construction. Evidence was given that since 1985 there had been attempts to build a computer facility to be shared by three or four departments. Until sometime in 1990, Customs and the Taxation Office were planning a shared facility. Only when Customs fell behind in the approval process did the two facilities side by side become inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts that it is now too late to delay either project. The Committee also accepts evidence that amalgamation of both facilities would incur significant costs. On the other hand, the Committee was of the view that substantial overall savings would have been made had both facilities been in the same building from the earliest planning stage. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) should conduct a review of all Commonwealth departments and authorities to ensure that as far as practicable facilities such as computing installations are collocated. The Committee believes this review is very important and should be undertaken as a matter of urgency because of the sums of money which could be involved. It is also important because of the long term and rational development of Commonwealth facilities which could result from it. </PARA>
<PARA> While at one time neither Customs nor the Tax Office appeared to have any problems about sharing a facility, at a later stage in the planning process concerns were expressed about having them in the same building because of the risks of industrial disputation or sabotage. The Committee found this an intriguing situation and believed it was an excellent example of a two-way bet which could not be sustained. If the two facilities were at risk in the same building, the Committee is at a loss to understand how that risk is reduced by having them in separate buildings on adjacent sites. </PARA>
<PARA> In its sixth report of 1990, which dealt with the Taxation Office's computer centre, the Committee drew attention to the power supply arrangements for the building. In particular the Committee questioned the need for two independent high voltage supplies and asked that this be reviewed because of the provision of other substantial backup facilities. The Public Works Committee was never informed about whether there was a review or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into this reference revealed that the same independent power supply arrangement was required with similar backup facilities. While the Committee accepts that there must be backup arrangements, it is not convinced of the need for a double power supply. The Committee also accepts that this is a requirement of the supplying authority, not an additional item included by Customs. The Committee has therefore recommended that Customs and the Australian Construction Services take up with the ACT Electricity and Water Authority its insistence that independent power supplies be provided to the two computer installations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like briefly to consider some of the other issues which came up during this inquiry. After the project was referred to the Committee, it became aware that the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory was conducting an inquiry into proposals for the transport system to service a new part of Canberra called Gungahlin. One of the components of that system causing community concern was the route of a major north-south road, the John Dedman Parkway. This route would have been very close to the site proposed for the Customs building. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee took evidence from the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the ACT Committee. I should mention that it is quite unusual for one committee to ask members of another committee to give evidence before it. It was perhaps unusual that the members of that Committee were so keen to appear before our Committee. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and Senator Margaret Reid appeared before the Committee. On behalf of the members of the Public Works Committee I would like to thank them for their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Committee's concerns, planners at the national and local levels got together and produced an alignment which would not compromise the Customs site. The planners gave evidence that this proposed westerly alignment would meet their needs if it were ever built. The Committee also received evidence that, provided appropriate precautions were taken, construction of the parkway would not endanger either the Customs building or the Taxation building. This Committee can only report to the Parliament on the reference it has received. It will be for the Joint Committee on the ACT to make a recommendation on the route for the John Dedman Parkway. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sports Commission forwarded two submissions which set out its concerns; these were principally reductions in car parking spaces and worsened access to that part of Bruce if the parkway were to be built on the western route. These issues would be more appropriately dealt with by the Joint Committee on the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee would also like to acknowledge the contribution of community groups such as the North Canberra Protection Group. Its concerns with another possible route of the parkway led to the delineation of this westerly option. The Committee also received a detailed submission from the Windess Hamner Partnership in Sydney, which argued that the proposed Customs building was too expensive for what was needed and was overspecified in many details. The Committee sought additional information from Customs, the Australian Construction Services and the Taxation Office on the issues raised in that submission, and concluded that the Windess Hamner Partnership was not able to sustain its views. </PARA>
<PARA> During this inquiry, issues of some significance to the approval process for Commonwealth facilities were raised. It is the hope of the Committee that the Minister's review will mean that comparable facilities are not duplicated as unnecessarily as were these two. To ensure that this does not happen, planning and approval processes need to be more effectively coordinated between departments and authorities. If this were to be done, the Committee's endeavours in this reference will be justified. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This country has a long history of food legislation. According to the Times of London in 1914 `Australia was the first of the Dominions of the British Empire and probably the first country in the world to enact pure food legislation and to establish standards to which manufacturers of food must conform'. That newspaper reported that there was `a pure food Act of the amplest description in force in Australia before the Bill for the American Act came before Congress'. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to establish food legislation in Australia was recognised as early as 1838 when the colony of New South Wales passed its Adulteration of Bread Act. In 1863 a Melbourne newspaper published lists of common adulterations in food and then went on to expose practices such as colouring sweets with lead chromate. In 1896 New South Wales passed its Public Health Act, which made it an offence to sell unwholesome or adulterated food or food which was falsely described. Adulteration was seen as both a health safety problem and a fair trading issue. </PARA>
<PARA> States retained the right to make food laws after Federation and in 1905 Victoria passed its Pure Food Act and was followed over the next five years by the remaining four States. Changed conditions after World War II made a new approach essential. In the late 1940s, the industry established food technology associations in each State and through their Federal body, the Australian Food Technology Association, these associations approached the Government with an offer to undertake preliminary work towards developing uniform regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1953 the Federal machinery to develop uniform food regulations was set up within the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;RC). The NH&amp;RC had been established much earlier, in 1938, to advise governments on public health matters. Food fell within its interests and when moves were made towards uniform regulation it was considered to be the obvious body with the scope of interests and expertise to guide the regulation process. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite substantial reforms to food industry regulation since then-most notably, an agreement by the Commonwealth and States for the joint development of standards-the need for reform remained evident because of the impact of the food regulation system, the growth of the processed food industry and the capacity of the regulatory system to respond swiftly to public health and safety issues, which are of increasing interest to consumers. Much more needs to be done to ensure that the public has a better opportunity to contribute to the framing of standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The food processing industry is a very important industry to all Australians. Not only is it a major contributor to our health and well-being through the production of safe and nutritious food, it also provides employment for many. The food processing and beverages industry represents the largest sector of our manufacturing industries. It accounts for approximately 20 per cent-that is, in excess of $30 billion a year-of manufacturing turnover and it employs some 173,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a major exporter of food. Our exports amount to over $8.5 billion a year, which is over 20 per cent of total Australian exports. Most of these are, however, low value added products. The opportunities are there to expand our exports of the processed foods-indeed, Austrade believes that our exports of processed foods to the Asian region could be doubled-but a number of studies have shown that there are continuing difficulties with achieving our full export potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry was examined by what was then the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) in October 1988. The IAC's final report agreed that the current system of food regulation was a significant impediment to the development of an efficient and competitive industry in Australia, that is, to the development of our export industry. Similar conclusions have been reached in a series of reports by the then Business Regulation Review Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC concluded that current administrative mechanisms were costly in terms of time and resources and had reduced the efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian food industry through increased costs and impediments to product innovation and adoption of new technologies.-Moreover, difficulties with the current standards and their administration were impeding gains in public safety and consumer protection sought by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that in recent years consumers have become increasingly conscious of the significance of food for health and are rightly concerned at a range of potential issues affecting its safety. They are also concerned about the levels of residues from pesticides and naturally occurring heavy metals that find their way into our food chain and about the type of additives and processing aids used in preparing the food for the supermarket shelves. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the commitment and the dedication of a large number of people, the current arrangements for developing domestic food standards are cumbersome and time-consuming. Under these arrangements new and revised food standards are developed through a cooperative arrangement with the States and Territories. At the Federal level, responsibility is split between the National Health and Medical Research Council and its various expert committees, under the Community Services and Health portfolio, and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, under the Attorney-General's portfolio. Standards are then implemented through State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problems with the current regulation system can be attributed to: a lack of clearly defined objectives for food regulation, together with the lack of a single body with responsibility for driving the system and developing standards; complexities and rigidities which render the present system ineffective at responding swiftly to public health problems and innovations in food production technology; and deficiencies in the mechanisms for setting and reviewing food standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that there needs to be more openness in the system with real opportunities for interested parties to contribute to the process. The current approach to State implementation could also be improved. While some States now adopt food standards by reference to the standards formulated by the National Health and Medical Research Council system, there are delays in States drafting their own regulations and differences in drafting between States increase the difficulty in ensuring uniform interpretation. Also, there are differences between State approaches in areas such as food hygiene and food recalls. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of the IAC report, the Government agreed that a revised mechanism for setting food standards was necessary and should be developed jointly by the Commonwealth, States and Territories. This position was endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers Conference in June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In close consultation with the States and Territories we have developed a reformed process for setting food standards which addresses the problems of the current arrangements. In October 1990 the direction of these reforms was agreed by the heads of all governments at the special Premiers Conference on Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, after such an impressive history in food regulation originally led by the States and then bringing on board the industry, scientists and consumers for the first time, the Federal Parliament is to have the opportunity to debate the issues and to contribute to the reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principles of the reforms being proposed are: to consolidate responsibility for domestic food standards development with a minimum number of decision-making layers; to ensure uniformity between jurisdictions; to establish objectives for food standards; to promote coordination of domestic and international food standards; to ensure an open and publicly accountable arrangement which would allow input by interested parties and provide for public hearings where appropriate; and, importantly, to retain the involvement of the States and Territories in standards development and administration. These principles are to be adopted by the Commonwealth, States and Territories through the Bill before the House and via a formal agreement between all heads of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me first describe the Commonwealth-State agreement. Under the existing agreement each State and Territory adopts the food standards that have been developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council and agreed to unanimously by members of the National Food Standards Council (NFSC). The National Food Standards Council comprises the responsible Ministers from all jurisdictions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing agreement also allows for each State to make unilateral variations to those food standards. It is now necessary to revise that agreement to take account of the decision of the special Premiers Conference that uniform national food standards should apply across the nation and be regulated by a national food authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the revised agreement presently being considered by the States and Territories, they would adopt food standards which have been recommended by the National Food Authority (NFA) and agreed to by the National Food Standards Council by majority decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let me turn to the Bill before the House. This Bill will establish the National Food Authority as an independent statutory authority and make provision for its membership, staffing, functions and objectives. It will also prescribe the process by which food standards are to be developed so as to ensure that all interests-that is, consumers, industry and scientific experts-are involved in the development of standards by providing adequate information about proposals and an opportunity to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority is to comprise a full time chair supported by four part time members. One of the part time members would be an officer of a State or Territory health authority with a good knowledge of the food regulation system. The Bill requires that the members of the Authority are to have experience or expertise in relevant fields such as public health, food science, the food industry or consumer advocacy. The members are, however, not representatives of the various interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires the proposed National Food Authority to pursue set objectives in making recommendations for the introduction, removal or amendment of food standards. The Authority will be required to have regard in priority order to:</PARA>
<PARA>the need to protect public health and safety;</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices;</PARA>
<PARA>the promotion of fair trading in food;</PARA>
<PARA>the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry; and</PARA>
<PARA>the promotion of consistency with standards applied to food in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth objective referring to the requirements for international trade is likely to be of increasing relevance. The food standards recommended by the Food Authority apply to all food sold in Australia-to imported food as well as to domestically produced food. And of course the producers who produce to meet domestic standards would be advantaged if these standards were consistent with overseas requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-or GATT-negotiations is also relevant. Those negotiations have identified the need to avoid food standards being used as barriers to trade. The GATT goal is to ensure that national standards should be based upon the standards developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission or, where they differ, they do so on a scientifically justified basis. The National Food Authority will contribute to the decision making on Codex standards and, in turn, harmonise our domestic food regulations, where appropriate, with Codex. This harmonisation would remove the potential for accusation that Australia was using food standards as a non-tariff trade barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal function of the Authority as set out in the Bill is to develop and review the standards relating to food available in Australia. Food standards prescribe a range of matters that relate to food composition, the use of additives, production, storage, maximum levels of environmental contamination including heavy metals and pesticides residues, labelling and packaging. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also gives the Authority a range of functions which are ancillary to the development of those standards. Generally, these relate to working with the States and Territories to:</PARA>
<PARA>conduct surveys of the food available,</PARA>
<PARA>arrange the recall of unsafe food, and</PARA>
<PARA>conduct food safety awareness and education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will also develop and publish recommended codes of practice and guidelines to assist industry in maintaining hygienic production and handling procedures to ensure the safety of the food. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes into considerable detail to prescribe the process to be followed by the Authority in relation to its principal function-the development of standards. The Bill requires the Authority to notify interested organisations, including all State and Territory health authorities and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and to place notices in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette about all proposals to develop or amend a food standard and to invite submissions on the proposals. The New Zealand Government will also be advised, so as to ensure a continuing exchange of information and consistent approach to food regulation between ourselves and our close trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA> After considering any submissions, the Authority will draft a standard and once again notify interested parties and the public and invite comment on the draft. When considering the more significant of proposed standards, the Authority will be empowered to hold a public hearing to give interested parties the opportunity to debate the issues in open forum. </PARA>
<PARA> This requirement for an open and public process is an essential element of the reform and I believe that it will become a model for the approach to making regulations in many other areas. In order to avoid the process itself becoming a barrier to necessary swift action, the Authority may simplify the process where issues are of minor significance and has a `fast track' available to it where there is an exceptional public health risk. </PARA>
<PARA> There are limited review processes included in the legislation. An applicant for development of a standard may seek review of the NFA's decision by the Administrative Appeal Tribunal where the Authority rejects an application without having developed a draft standard. The final recommendation of the NFA and the decisions of the NFSC are not subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the complaints about the present system is that it can take far too long to consider an application and process it through the complex National Health and Medical Research Council committee structure. The reforms proposed in this system will overcome this by imposing a timeframe within which the Authority must complete its scientific assessment of a proposed standard and make a recommendation to the National Food Standards Council. This period is first established as a maximum of 12 months and it may be reduced by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will employ scientists over a range of disciplines whose expertise will be supplemented as needed by experts either called on an ad hoc basis to advise on individual standards or employed as consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of this process the Authority will present a draft standard and recommendation to the Council of State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for food regulation-the National Food Standards Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, under our Federal system whereby the Commonwealth will provide the facilities and processes to develop the standards which are to be implemented by States and Territories, it is essential that the States and Territories are fully involved. As I have already mentioned, they will be represented on the management of the Authority and will be advised of all proposals coming before the Authority, thus having the opportunity to make submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill provides a mechanism for States and Territories to be involved in the broader issues such as the development of the policies within which food standards are set. </PARA>
<PARA> This involvement will be through a high level advisory committee which would be established by the Bill. This committee would comprise the chairperson of the Authority, a representative of each State and Territory, a representative of the departments of Community Services and Health and Primary Industries and Energy and a representative of the New Zealand Government. Provision is also made for the chairman to appoint other members for specific purposes such as to provide advice on industry and consumer issues. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a committee to routinely examine proposals for food standards. It is intended as a top level policy advisory body to assist the Authority in setting its broad policy guidelines and directions. It would only become involved in consideration of an individual standard when the chair of the Authority believes that top level policy advice is needed-the development of that standard would remain subject to the fixed timescales. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures set out in the Bill represent the best thinking of people working within the present system and have been developed to ensure that the principles of the reforms that I mentioned earlier are carried through into practice. However, with such a major change to industry regulation, we must keep the system under review to ensure that the reforms actually achieve the efficiencies that they were designed to achieve. The Government will therefore instruct the Authority to review its operating procedures after they have been in place for two years to assess any changes that may be necessary to improve efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes that within its first 18 months of operation the Food Authority should review the policy for setting food standards and prepare a timetable for the review of each existing food standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Public confidence in the food supply is essential to protect the marketability of agricultural produce and processed foods. Both Commonwealth and State governments have responsibility, complementary to the role of industry, to promote quality and hygiene and this can be effectively provided through a national food authority. The establishment of such a body, together with the proposed heads of government agreement, will be a major achievement in removing regulatory impediments to the development of the Australian food industry and establishing an effective mechanism for responding to food safety concerns. The proposed approach is strongly supported by the food industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House ensures that consumer groups have the opportunity to contribute to food standards and recognises the need for all of us to be able to be confident that food we purchase is safe and wholesome and that the information about that food is comprehensive and adequate. The Bill also recognises the significance of the food industry and the need for interstate and international trade means that the process for setting food standards should be efficient and dynamic. </PARA>
<PARA> The bringing together of the administrative responsibility for food standards and imported food risk assessment policies into one body will bring about some efficiencies of operations. However the tight timeframes for finalising applications for new standards and the need to review all existing standards for conformity with the objectives set out in the Bill will involve a modest additional resource commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>The National Health Amendment Bill gives effect to a number of government initiatives relating to nursing homes and to the domiciliary nursing care benefit. The Bill aims to change the Commonwealth nursing home benefit arrangements for a specified number of government nursing homes. The purpose of these amendments is to allow payment of increased Commonwealth nursing home benefits to a special category of government nursing homes, to be referred to as adjusted fee government nursing homes. The increased benefit will be paid on the same general basis as that paid to non-government nursing homes and will be based on the care aggregate module system and a modification of the standard aggregate module system currently used for non-government homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth nursing home benefits paid in respect of residents of government nursing homes have been frozen at November 1984 levels. Since 1987, the Government has progressively taken steps to introduce an equitable national standard funding approach to financing nursing home care. This approach links Commonwealth funding to the care needs of individual nursing home residents. Quality of life and quality of care standards are a key element of the Government's policy on nursing home care. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements will result in a higher level of benefit for these adjusted fee government homes. The higher level of benefit will apply only to a limited number of recently established smaller government homes which are likely to meet the Commonwealth's outcome standards for quality of care and quality of life. The nursing homes to become adjusted fee government nursing homes are listed in this Bill. This list will become a schedule to the National Health Act. For these homes the new rate of benefit will apply retrospectively to 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Payment of higher levels of nursing home benefits to this limited number of government nursing homes will be defrayed by the offset provided by the relevant State government's withdrawal of a number of other government nursing home beds in that State. The only long term financial impact will be through the routine process of indexation which is currently applied to non-government nursing home funding and will now apply to adjusted fee government nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Several amendments are proposed in this Bill for the exempt nursing home arrangements. The Government introduced the exempt nursing homes provisions last year. These cater for residents who wish to pay a higher resident contribution in return for receiving a higher level of accommodation and services. However, experience in the operation of these provisions has shown that they do not adequately cater for those people who did not choose to enter an exempt home, but were already in the home at the time it became exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing legislation, a resident in a nursing home at the time it is given exempt bed status can remain in the home for two years after that date without paying an additional contribution. Beyond that period they are automatically classified as exempt and so must pay the additional contribution or leave the home. Many of these people cannot afford the additional contribution and so must leave the home. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision has caused distress to many of the residents of the homes which were given exempt status last year, and to their relatives. The Bill proposes changes to the legislation to allow residents in homes given exempt bed status in the future to stay permanently without paying the additional exempt bed resident contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the current legislation, if a home's approval as exempt expires and is not renewed, its exempt residents will immediately cease to be exempt. These people chose to enter that home specifically to obtain the additional accommodation and services an exempt home provides, and it is reasonable that they be allowed to remain exempt for as long as they stay in the home. This would also ease the home's transition to non-exempt status. This Bill will implement these changes sought by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently if a nursing home, in its application for exempt status, makes an error in the list of additional accommodation and services it promises to provide, it is bound by that list. The Bill will give the Minister the power to amend this list if the proprietor so requests. </PARA>
<PARA> When a nursing home applies for exempt status it promises to provide certain services. If the home then does not provide these services the Minister can currently take no effective action to remedy this situation. People choosing to enter exempt homes deserve better protection than this. Accordingly, the Bill will allow the Minister to remove a home's exempt status where it does not meet the conditions under which it has been given this status. </PARA>
<PARA> Other related changes in the Bill in relation to exempt homes improve the safeguards for residents in exempt homes and make minor changes to assist the proprietors of exempt homes.The Bill also introduces an amendment to allow certain payments to nursing homes outside the fees and benefits system. This is a purely machinery amendment, with no policy or funding implications. It is designed solely to reduce the administrative work load on the Department of Community Services and Health and on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently all nursing homes are eligible for additional funding to assist them to employ a registered nurse at all times. Only the smaller homes, however, need this assistance, so the funding formula is such that only these smaller homes receive it. The funding formula and other necessary details are set out in principles formulated pursuant to the National Health Act. The Bill retains this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the additional funding is provided by way of a variation to the home's approved fees, which means that, for all homes receiving this funding, the fees change each month. These fees have to be authorised, fed into the computer and notified to the home. This creates considerable work for the Department. It also creates considerable work for the industry, which must change its billing arrangements each month to allow for this. This Bill will allow the additional funding to be provided directly, without the need to change the home's fees. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation applies for some small nursing homes which are receiving additional funding to assist them to achieve financial viability. The Bill retains the existing arrangements for determining eligibility and the level of additional funding, and it allows this funding to be provided without the need to change the home's fees every month. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also clarifies the Commonwealth's power to recover overpayments from nursing homes. This Bill also strengthens the legal power of the Government to take action against nursing homes with poor standards of care. In a small number of cases, nursing home proprietors have not provided the quality of life and care expected by the Government. As the Commonwealth subsidises each resident in a nursing home-an average of $23,000 per year, as well as the resident's contribution from their pension-it is essential for the Commonwealth to be in a position to ensure accountability for the funds it makes available and to protect the rights of a potentially powerless group of individuals in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes it clear that the satisfaction of the Commonwealth outcome standards is a condition of approval of all Commonwealth funded nursing homes. It also clarifies the ability of the Commonwealth either to take sanctions against the home or, if necessary, to withdraw or suspend a nursing home's approval to receive Commonwealth funding. A minor amendment is also included in this Bill to ensure that the role of the community visitor, as spelt out in the Act, does not conflict with the role of standards monitoring teams and departmental complaints officers. Changes to the method of approving applications for domiciliary nursing care benefit are also contained in this Bill. Under the National Health Act, as it currently stands, the Secretary's power to approve a person for domiciliary nursing care benefit can only be delegated to a medical practitioner employed by the Commonwealth. The proposed amendment will have the effect of extending this delegation to registered nurses. Delegates will also no longer be required to be employed in a Commonwealth department. This will allow the Secretary to delegate this power to medical practitioners and registered nurses who are not officers of the Department, but who may, for example, be employees of a State or Territory department. </PARA>
<PARA> Since a decision to approve an application for domiciliary nursing care benefit is primarily a decision about the need for continuing nursing care, it is appropriate that nurses be included as delegates of the Secretary. Medical certificates, however, will still be required with every application. I commend the Bill to the House and I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. This debate takes place under the operation of the guillotine, which is quite unsatisfactory. It means that the debate on this very important area is going to be truncated this evening. I will endeavour to be brief in what I say. I wish to register a strong protest at the fact that this Bill is not going to receive the debate that it merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must also say that it is indicative of the way in which this area is being managed by the Government that before the debate on this Bill has even commenced the Government is already proposing amendments to its amendment Bill. It finds it very hard to get this area right. It is an area which, as I shall indicate in my speech, deserves considerably more coherent thinking and attention from the Government than it has so far received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to amend the operation of the Student Assistance Act, its refunding procedures and appeal procedures. Student assistance is a very significant part of total Commonwealth spending on education. Outlays for student assistance have grown at an average rate of 6.9 per cent in real terms since 1980-81. The 1990-91 Budget provided $1.2 billion for student assistance, including $936m for Austudy. Indeed, 16 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure on education is spent on student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House is one which makes a number of specific amendments to the student assistance arrangements. It is not a Bill which in any way addresses the important problems and inequities of the Austudy scheme. Consequently, it is not a Bill which will in any way allay the widespread concern in the community and in this Parliament over the operation of student assistance in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to increase savings from the administration of the Student Assistance Act 1973 and to strengthen the safeguards against fraud. We welcome that as far as it goes, which is not very far. One amendment contained in the Bill will require students and parents or the spouse of a student applying for Austudy to provide a tax file number. The Government estimates savings to be approximately $7m-$8m from the tax file number requirement and associated package involving data comparison and $1m from the restructuring of the data proposal change. The provisions outlined therefore reduce expenditure by ensuring a tighter policing of the regulations, but only by what must be seen as a relatively small amount, given expenditure on this scheme. There remains a need for a thorough review of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also put in place recovery mechanisms for overpayments of student assistance payments and require the Student Assistance Review Tribunal to give written reasons within 10 working days of the handing down of its decision. This is a measure to speed up the review process and is welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill further provides that the Minister's determinations on the approval of courses become subject to disallowance. This is a response to the concern expressed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that ministerial determinations under the Act were not subject to parliamentary review. We support this and we also support the replacement of the Minister's power to make determinations about the manner in which Austudy should be paid by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not, however, be supporting the proposal under which the obligation on the Government to provide an annual report to the Parliament is removed. The Government proposes that the annual report on the Act be incorporated into the Department's annual report. This is the one measure in the Bill that we are not prepared to accept. I will be moving an amendment to the Bill during the committee stage to delete this proposed amendment from the Bill. I now propose to move a second reading amendment in respect of the Bill. This amendment is being circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all the words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's continued mismanagement of education, and in particular, it deplores the Government's-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) failure to define clear objectives for the implementation and operation of student assistance programs;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) failure to administer student assistance programs in a financially responsible manner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) failure to structure and administer student assistance programs so that they operate in a fair and equitable manner''. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to have the opportunity to be able to address the House on the issue of the student assistance scheme, and Austudy in particular. It is indicative of the piecemeal approach that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) have continued to adopt towards the administration of their portfolios, and indicative of what has been the administration of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy today is a ramshackle scheme. The inequity and the hardship felt by so many families and children reflect the incompetent ad hoc administration in this, as in each other, area of education policy at present. The notion of a clever country has been turned into a murky pool of bitterness and disillusion and student distress by the damage to both quality and opportunity resulting from the bright ideas of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-ideas which produce upheaval but rarely, if ever, have any follow through and usually leave a disastrous chain of consequences in their wake. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Ross Garnaut, an adviser whom the Government respects, gave an address to young graduates at the Australian National University in which he expressed very clearly the feelings throughout Australia about the Government's education policies:</PARA>
<PARA>A few days ago a Commonwealth Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>I think it may have been the Minister at the table, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services-</PARA>
<PARA>said that it is important that we develop a positive vision of the ANU. Meagre and mediocre minds are as incapable of seeing the reality of a great centre of scholarship, as of sharing the vision from whence it grew. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Garnaut went on to say to the students:</PARA>
<PARA>You are the latest inheritors of a great tradition. I hope that you will join with many others to protect and to build this tradition, against the powerful levelling, the corrosion which grinds away at every mountain, hill and promontory, which rises above the flat lines of this ancient continent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very perceptive comment and it expressed very widespread feelings throughout higher education in this country. Let me reiterate at the outset the coalition's commitment to the importance and regard it has for the quality of educational institutions and the rights of access that all students should have to primary, secondary and tertiary education. In Australia today every person with the will and the capacity to pursue higher education should be able to get access. The opportunity to learn to improve one's ability and knowledge to make the best of one's opportunities is central to the coalition's philosophy. It is imperative that the opportunity should be there, regardless of a person's financial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition is totally committed in its support for student assistance. This is not a matter for equivocation. It is a matter of stated policy. The coalition, unlike the Government, will meet that commitment. In cases of need there must be financial assistance available. The evidence at the moment, however, is that we do not have student assistance arrangements which are providing such assistance. We do not have student assistance arrangements which are meeting clear objectives and achieving those objectives efficiently and in a fair and equitable way. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy does not have clear objectives, nor is it administered efficiently and it does not operate in a fair and equitable way. A most useful source of information in this regard is the recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I pay particular tribute not only to members of that Committee who are in the House, but also to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) on this side of the chamber, who contributed effectively to this report. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will hear a number of them in the course of this debate. As usual, the Opposition has a much longer list of speakers in a debate on education than the Government is able to muster. Those honourable members will be here to speak in this chamber to the extent that the Government allows them to speak. The report contains many significant criticisms of existing student assistance arrangements and of the way in which the Government has mismanaged this very important policy area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To remind those honourable members of the Committee who are in the chamber, and other honourable members who are not on that Committee, I will read one of the major conclusions of that Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>DEET's current performance indicators emphasise processing efficiency rather than program effectiveness. Programs such as Austudy, Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children's Scheme have never been properly evaluated. The Committee finds it disturbing that billions of dollars have been spent on programs for which the success or otherwise has never been assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Committee found that, despite its supposed targeting towards students in financial need, under current legislation Austudy is, in fact, going to students who are not in such need. For example, the Committee stated that it is `unacceptable that dependent students who have extensive assets should be eligible for financial support'. Also, according to the report of that Committee, Austudy is continuing to go to some families who can well afford to meet their children's education costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that it is unacceptable that inequalities in the taxation system result in the payment of allowances to those who are well able to meet their own or their children's education costs. Honourable members of this House will also be aware of reports that Austudy is being paid to people who are not complying with the spirit and intent of the scheme. There are repeated reports from teachers and their representatives that secondary students in receipt of Austudy benefits are not attending classes, and there is no satisfactory monitoring system that could ensure that they were attending and that this abuse was being prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it has been said that all that is required to get independent Austudy is for parents to be willing to sign a statutory declaration that they will no longer support their child, regardless of their means. So bedevilled is the administration of student assistance that the Committee found it necessary to recommend to the Government and to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, who is at the table, that the Government take the lead and develop some clear objectives for student financial assistance. The Government has been operating student assistance programs now for more than eight years but it still has not determined the policy objectives of these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it the purpose of Austudy to bring into formal education students who would not otherwise participate? That would seem to be one of the objectives. Yet at a time when the Government says that it cannot find the money to fund enough places for qualified students in higher education, almost $1 billion-one thousand million dollars-is being spent annually, presumably to increase demand from students who would not otherwise participate in higher education, if that is an objective. Few facts more starkly indicate the lack of coherence in the Government's policies in education. </PARA>
<PARA> While the system trembles under an excess of demand, the Government is spending $1 billion per year to increase demand still further, but says that it cannot find the money to fund the additional places. If the purpose of the scheme is to assist students without discrimination, it is totally unsatisfactory at present that Austudy is not available to students entering private tertiary institutions. This clearly reveals the ideological elements and the political bias which permeate the Government's thinking behind this scheme. The coalition believes that Austudy should be available to students in private tertiary institutions, and we will do away with this discrimination on coming into office. </PARA>
<PARA> In April, no fewer than three reports were tabled in the Parliament, reporting on various aspects of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. They were not effusive in their praise of the Department. They were, I regret to say, damning in their condemnation. There was a certain awe at the Department's ability to spend vast sums of money, combined with a shocked sense of disbelief in its ability to manage money, in its avoidance of review of its activities and its constant promotion of ill considered programs, each criticism impinging directly on the vital area of student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> First, as I have noted, we had the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Secondly, we had the Australian National Audit Office report which drew attention to what it called in the Department of Employment, Education and Training `a significant number of unsatisfactory matters which highlighted underlying inadequacies'. The National Audit Office was concerned, as we should all be, that satisfactory standards were not maintained in accounting for certain public moneys. It pointed out that overseas students in New South Wales and Victoria owed a total of almost $5m in fees to August last year, but that the Department had not pursued the money. It was also criticised for not clearing its overseas student charge account, a failure which cost the Commonwealth a considerable amount of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we find in an Australian National Audit Office report on the implementation of program evaluation for the Department of Employment, Education and Training both a failure of the Department to manage its programs properly and a coyness, if not an outright reluctance, to submit to the evaluation procedures of the Department of Finance. The report states that the Department of Employment, Education and Training `exercises substantial autonomy in the management of evaluations'. In other words, it tells nobody what is going on and it will not allow others to measure its performance. It is a secret. These concerns-and they are by no means minor concerns-are symptomatic of an underlying malaise in the administration of education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one of the most serious issues which is currently concerning the community about Austudy: that is, the matter of rural educational disadvantage. Students and potential students throughout Australia are suffering because of the inadequacies of the Government's programs and there is no doubt that one of the most severely disadvantaged groups is students in regional, rural and isolated areas. Many rural families are missing out or cannot afford to send their children to school or university because of the costs of transport, board and communications. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, in Victoria, in the just published study entitled Patterns of Participation in Higher Education, the participation rate in all country areas is below the State average. In some country areas, the participation rate is barely one-third of that of parts of the metropolitan area. Let me state now that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services is rapidly building a reputation for his insensitivity towards the needs of students from rural areas and those in difficult economic circumstances. The inequities and rigidities of student assistance programs at a time of severe rural downturn are, once again, widening the gap between country and city, and many rural families are being forced to abandon their children's studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The inappropriateness of the Austudy scheme has forced students to leave and be withdrawn from schools and universities for lack of financial support. When they turn to the Government for assistance, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services treat them with contempt. They send them terse little notes simply saying that they are not eligible for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural crisis has exposed a significant weakness in Austudy, as families with little or no real income are being excluded by the assets test-a situation that makes a cynical mockery of the clever country boast. There is an urgent need for the immediate introduction of emergency provisions for Austudy-hardship provisions-to prevent students from being withdrawn from education because their parents can no longer afford to keep them at school, where otherwise those families are excluded from Austudy by the operation of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents excluded should be able to make application for financial assistance on a case by case basis. The development of appropriate provisions of this kind is an urgent matter and I urge the Minister to give the most serious consideration to the amendment of Austudy to introduce such provisions as soon as is practically possible. It is a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Senate endorsed the Opposition's motion demanding immediate action from the Government to provide emergency assistance to rural families who are being forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds as a result of the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The cases that one hears about are really quite heart-rending. I cite the case of a family with four children living in north-west New South Wales, isolated from schooling. One student is on correspondence distance education. The mother is finding it difficult to cope and hoping to get help from volunteers. Another student boards privately to attend a high school. The third child is at secondary boarding school and the fourth is at university. That family describe their financial situation as `critical'. The assets test excludes them from any additional allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> A coalition Government believes that the assets test on the assistance for isolated children's benefit should be abolished. It is a test which applies solely to rural families and misrepresents their income earning capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports are now coming in from hostels and boarding schools around Australia of applications for places not taken up and students being withdrawn. In Western Australia, for instance, 47 isolated students did not proceed with their hostel bookings for 1991, 29 have been withdrawn from hostels already this year and many students have been forced to transfer to distance education and some have just not proceeded to upper secondary level. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time now the Opposition has been calling for a thorough review of Austudy and pointing out the inequities and inefficiencies which are confirmed by every report which comes out on this scheme. I am pleased to say that the Government has apparently not been deaf-not completely deaf-to these calls and, while it has not been keen to promote the fact, it has in fact indicated that it is prepared to consider a complete change to student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training has provided me with a document which sets out the terms of reference for the consultant's inquiry, and I seek leave to table this document for the information of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that the Government come clean on what it intends to do with this review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is a highly intelligent man, has in many ways a very small focus in terms of the education needs of this country. Following 25 years in education, I have a very good memory of the initiatives of Opposition parties. They were subsequently lacking in principle, lacking in policy and were simply dancing at the margin. They are interested in small outcomes and their record in the period from 1976 until 1983 was appalling. Even if one looks at the issues at State level, one sees that their promises are continually broken when they talk about the expansion of education funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act, which was introduced by the Whitlam Government, is the cornerstone of financial assistance to financially disadvantaged students and it had not undergone any major changes until late 1987. From 1987, education income support has been provided mainly through Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children's assistance schemes. The objectives of these schemes are intended to provide equality of educational opportunity and to improve educational outcomes through the provision of financial assistance to students who are financially disadvantaged, of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island origin, geographically isolated or disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy, the major component of the Student Assistance Act, provides assistance on a non-competitive basis to students 16 years of age and over undertaking approved full time secondary or tertiary studies, and student assistance-as the honourable member for Goldstein pointed out-is a billion dollar plus expenditure program. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of secondary student recipients has trebled since 1983, while the number of tertiary students has increased by 56 per cent in that time. I will come back to those figures a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently there are about 410,000 students in receipt of assistance, which represents a doubling of numbers assisted since 1983. Corresponding with the introduction of Austudy in 1987, year 12 retention rates increased from 48.7 per cent in 1986 to 57.6 per cent in 1988. Of course, they are well over the 65 per cent now. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 42 per cent of tertiary students and 36 per cent of secondary students aged 16 or over are assisted by Austudy, and about 44 per cent of all eligible students receive full rates for their category. I think that is a pretty reasonable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition education spokesperson, the honourable member for Goldstein has said in this House that Austudy is a poorly targeted scheme. In fact, Senator Kemp, in the Senate Estimates Committee, asked the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it likely that all, or even most of those recipients would change their career paths completely if the program was discontinued?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Does this not suggest that there are better ways of spending the scarce education dollar?</PARA>
<PARA>Is it therefore the real policy of Opposition members to abolish the Austudy scheme? That is what they are on about. If it is, why do they not come out and state it, and then go out and sell their proposals to the 410,000 recipients of Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children and their families? While they are at it, they should try to sell their education and health voucher system, their 15 per cent consumption tax, their abolition of capital gains tax, their abolition of fringe benefits tax-I see the honourable member for Goldstein has left the House-their abolition of the assets test, their general $3 billion reduction in government expenditure in health, education and welfare. Perhaps Opposition members will take a leaf out of the book of their mates and colleagues in New Zealand. Remember that? The tories have been in government there for six months. What did they do? They reduced tertiary places by 50 per cent in six months. That is really what the Opposition here is on about. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987, in contrast, the number of students assisted has increased by around 50 per cent to the end of 1990-not decreased. The amount of financial assistance provided by this Government has increased by well over 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In my own State of South Australia, the Austudy figures are stark, particularly in regard to secondary and adult secondary education. In 1987, about 10,000 students received assistance. In 1990, three years later, the figure is around the 16,000 mark. The actual funding amount has also increased in relation to the number of students, in addition to this Government's policy of targeting funding to those genuinely in need. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that 53 per cent of Austudy recipients are in fact secondary students. This represents a fairly large increase overall in the financial commitment by this Government towards equity and fairness of opportunity in our education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1986 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on the geographical breakdown of tertiary graduates shows that Port Adelaide-my seat-has only 4.7 per cent of tertiary educated people, compared with the Liberal blue ribbon seats of Boothby and Kooyong, which have 18 and 23 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the financial restraints and barriers to further a student's education in areas such as the western suburbs of Adelaide, and in particular the electorate of Port Adelaide, for some time have needed to be addressed. Clearly, a voucher system would be a disaster in these areas. I welcome anyone from the Opposition to come to my electorate and try to sell it. The Government has come to the party in respect of providing increased student financial assistance and increased places in our tertiary institutions but there is still a lot to be achieved-140,000 more places. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Adelaide operates the fairway scheme which aims to provide students from disadvantaged backgrounds easier access to university courses. I am very pleased that Adelaide University has recognised and acted to overcome the inequities that still exist. The fairway scheme benefits the western suburbs of Adelaide and the dormitory suburbs north and south and hopefully will help increase the number of tertiary educated students in my electorate to well over the 1986 figure of 4.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Amendment Bill will not make major changes to the Austudy scheme. It will, in short, continue to serve benefits to those genuinely entitled to payment. The Government has introduced wide-ranging policies and programs which identify and target funding to individuals and families more accurately and, indeed, more effectively. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill is no different. By targeting, benefits have and will continue to be maximised to those genuinely entitled students. </PARA>
<PARA> Students will not receive Austudy if they do not provide their tax file number. This will also apply to parents or partners if the means test applies to parents and a partner. The Minister will be able to prescribe by regulations similar parallel exemptions to those in the Social Security Act. This measure was announced in the 1990 Budget context. It is part of a broader package involving data matching, which will generate savings of $7m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there have been extensive consultations with the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that there will be no disclosure of confidential information. Unfortunately, there have been some cases where a student's Austudy file has been sought by the non-custodial parent in student assistance files from subpoenas by courts and tribunals. Again, this amendment is parallel to provisions in the Social Security Act. However, it will not restrict access to Austudy files by courts or tribunals hearing Austudy appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this Bill is the further tightening of the over-payments system-clients who receive moneys through the Austudy program in excess of their entitlement. In future, it will be less financially attractive for students to obtain payments to which they are not entitled, or to receive payments higher than their entitlement. This will reduce both the number of clients who make deliberately false misrepresentations of their circumstances and those who deliberately fail to comply with the notification provisions of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The restructuring of the late payment charges is expected to generate revenue of up to $1m a year and reflects the costs involved with the recovery of these debts. Penalties already apply-again, similar to those which apply in the Social Security Act. At present, if a debtor is notified of a debt but does not repay it within three months, that person is liable for a late payment charge of $15 plus 10 per cent of the outstanding amount after the three month period, up to a maximum of $515. Interest also accrues from the end of this period. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will vary the existing arrangements so that after the three months the debtor will be liable for a flat payment charge of $100 and interest applied on the debt from the date of advise. Of course, the change is and will remain a discretionary measure and is to be used primarily to encourage prompt repayments of debts rather than to raise revenue. Other changes are, by and large, non-controversial and will have little financial impact on the delivery aspect of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is putting greater emphasis on the quality and timeliness of processing claims and inquiries. Presently, 90 per cent of applications are being processed within three weeks. The delivery of Austudy is now being developed through the Commonwealth Employment Service network, which will increase the effectiveness and access to the scheme. Many metropolitan offices and all country offices can now accept applications. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time that I have left, I would like to acknowledge that there are some shortfalls in the delivery of Austudy benefits. There is scope for continued refinements, which this Government will continue to make, particularly in light of the recent report on student financial assistance by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, chaired by my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to debate the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1991, I must express concern about the situation with which we are faced in Australia. I would like to look at the back drop to what we are debating. First of all, we now have a situation of very high unemployment, which is rapidly rising. Of course, if students were not being attracted by student assistance schemes to continue their education, the level of unemployment would be much higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that only a few Government speakers are listed to take part in this debate. At the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us that we would have to be the clever country. It is now becoming typical in education debates in this Parliament for Opposition speakers to outnumber Government speakers by about two to one. So the Opposition's concern about this area of government administration is very obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that the actual assistance which is being given to young people in Australia is not being administered effectively. Last week I spoke during the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It is a good report that really goes to the heart of the problem. We need to go back over what this report had to say about student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we are talking about an expenditure of over $1 billion in the Austudy area, there are no clear policy objectives. One really does wonder how long it is going to take a government and a department in this area to get their act together. There are no clear policy objectives for that $1 billion expenditure. It is absolutely incredible. I just wonder where the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has been? I wonder where his Department has been in terms of alerting him to the fact that there are no clear objectives for the administration of this amount of money. Not only are there no clear objectives but also the report has found that there are no adequate performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Act to provide student assistance was brought into this Parliament in 1973. This Government has been administering student assistance for over eight years. Yet there are no indicators in place to determine whether it is actually doing the job it should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The question for any person administering education and student assistance is how well is it being managed. I am not speaking about the total number of students who are going on to university or continuing to year 12. I acknowledge that that is important. I support the Government in its endeavour to get students to stay at school and to go on to tertiary education because this is fundamental to developing the human resources of this country. But what we are debating here and what we are concerned about is the fact that the funds which have been allocated are not actually being managed effectively. Back in 1988, anything up to 27 per cent of young people receiving assistance were actually over-paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of this, about which the Opposition is concerned, is that there are fewer young people who are able to be assisted. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that systems are in place which enable the taxpayer's money to go to the maximum number of young people. It is a great pity that there are young people out there who need assistance but cannot get it; had this program been administered more effectively, I am sure they would have got the assistance they required because the money would have been available. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), stated quite clearly that the Opposition was going to abandon Austudy. Of course, a feature of the Government's arguments in this type of debate is that the Opposition is going to abandon this or that policy. The Government is running the line that the Opposition is going to abandon unemployment benefits after nine months. It has not said anything about the other policies or other programs which are in place to be taken up after that point of time; and it does not mention the fact that the Government itself was going to abolish unemployment benefits after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Government comes into the Parliament and says that the Opposition is going to abandon Austudy. It has no skerrick of evidence to support the making of such statements, and it has indulged purely in a fear campaign. It is trying to paper over the deficiencies of its administration of the student assistance program. It is a great pity that in a debate the Government has to stoop to that level to try to gain some credibility or win back support out there in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that, if the Government had set up clear objectives, had set up its performance indicators and had undertaken a clear assessment of the effectiveness of its student assistance programs through the eight years in which it has been in government, then probably we would not be having this type of debate here tonight; nor would the Government in the next few months be undertaking a review of student assistance programs. I commend the Government for acting upon the Opposition's plea to undertake a review of Austudy. It is certainly necessary, and the report which the Committee brought down is very clear evidence of the need for a total review of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that education has a very important part to play in a functioning society. It has a very important part to play in a whole range of areas of developing people's skills and talents. We are fully supportive of excellence and quality and of giving opportunity to people through education. In particular, as the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) said, rural education is one of the areas in which we believe there is a need for some equity because, when we look at the figures of young people who go on to tertiary education, for example, we find that 42 per cent come from urban areas, but only 26 per cent come from rural areas. That is not equity, and the Government cannot claim that there is social justice in that. Why do the outlying rural areas of Australia not get the same type of assistance and the same number of young people going on per head of population as in the urban areas?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to redress that situation in the future. There is no doubt about it. In many of the regional areas of Australia there is high unemployment and, therefore, greater need for better education to be available to those young people. It is important for whoever is in government-and no doubt we will be there within the next two years-to address this situation, so that people in rural Australia will get the necessary support and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, with the economic circumstances faced in rural Australia, it is critical that there be some hardship provisions for families, so that they can ensure that their young people can continue to go to school, go on to technical and further education or go into higher education in the universities. I certainly ask the Government to look at this in the immediate future, so that young people will not lose out by being unable to go on with their education in the event of the economic circumstances with which they are faced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports six out of the seven proposed Government amendments, but we expect the annual report-and there is a reason for it-to come here before the Parliament; we do not think that the matter should just be put into the annual report. We believe that that should be open and that we should be able to discuss that sort of matter. However, we accept the other proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As seconder to the motion for the Opposition amendments, I want to state finally that there has been a failure to define clear objectives; failure to administer student assistance; and failure to structure and administer the programs so that they operate in a fair and equitable manner. Education is vital for Australia's future. It is unfortunate that the assistance being given to our young people has not been managed effectively and efficiently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this debate and I want to take issue with the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who thanked all Opposition members who served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and two of the Government members who served on it, who were in the House. I want to reiterate my earlier remarks in thanking all members of the Committee. It is a pity to try to make political capital out of what can be a very effective bipartisan process-that is, the committee system of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a few remarks about Austudy. Firstly, I have always supported the notion and the concept that we should try to target those least able to afford education in our community and to provide them with assistance. Of all the people in my electorate who are receiving Austudy, none have rushed up to me and said, `Look, this is terrible; this is some money I do not really want'. Every reaction I have had is that Austudy has been very much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a difficulty with the Committee's report. Certainly the Committee was very critical of the administration of the scheme. It did acknowledge-although it has not been subsequently acknowledged in the public debate-that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has striven mightily to improve the service. Indeed, the Committee said that the service ought to be improved even further-and I stand by that. But I want to acknowledge the fact that over a period of time the Department has been striving to improve the service. The difficulty in administration has to do with the complexities of eligibility, and the easier eligibility is made, the harder it is to target the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make is that, if we are looking for student financial assistance of its own to improve retention rates-that is, more people staying on to years 11 and 12 or going on to university-I believe that is an impossible dream, because I think many other factors need to be taken into account, and I will come to them later. The honourable member opposite suggested that we have a massive problem in administration because of overpayments. If there is any error of judgment that I would like to see the Department make, it is to process a payment early rather than late. Indeed, the Department is being specifically encouraged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The overpayments often result due to the fluctuating income individual students might receive. The Committee, I think, has made a reasonable recommendation in terms of lifting student income, and I expect that that problem is going to therefore diminish. It is certainly not a question of causing concern for the people of Australia as far as the administration of the scheme is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members have pointed out the social disadvantage in rural Australia. I am pleased to say that this has been identified in the Committee's report. We did not want to indulge in tokenism and suggest quick fix solutions; rather, because this rural disadvantage has been known of and acknowledged for some time, and particularly because of the recession, we wanted to tap into it. But what is most ungenerous of Opposition members is that, with at least two Government speakers from metropolitan electorates more than happy to acknowledge inequalities in, and committed to improving, rural education opportunities, they will not acknowledge that there are educational inequalities in urban areas. </PARA>

Of course, there would not be two better fighters for educational issues on the Government side than those two honourable members. My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) pointed to the increasing number of higher education places that this Government has provided. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) well knows, this Government has instituted the University of Western Sydney, something that many commentators said should be denied to the people of western Sydney. After all, we were just bearers of wood and water, not entitled to such institutions in our midst! It is a source of pride for us from western Sydney, particularly those of us on the Government benches, that we have gained that institution. That institution will grow and grow, and will become, I suggest, one of the pre-eminent and largest higher education institutions in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the retention rates, I do not think that providing student financial assistance is going to help. The greatest area of inequality in Australia, particularly in New South Wales-the most inflexible of all States-is the fact that the education system is biased towards the minority of students who want to go on to tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the notion that we should have more students going on to universities, but the reality is that the majority of students do not see that as their career path. They see an equally valuable contribution to be made to society-and their own personal careers-by choosing things like apprenticeships and traineeships or by getting a job in the retail sector or the hospitality sector or in a whole variety of other occupations. By and large, the education system-this is especially reflected in the views of the Opposition-treats them as second-class citizens and they are in an education system that does not cater for their needs. If one urgent reform is required in Australia, it is to address that imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> Having talked to Brian Finn, who is chairing perhaps one of the most important inquiries into post-compulsory education at the request of the Australian Education Council, I look forward to his report, because I think at long last the silent majority in education will have a spokesman and will have their needs clearly articulated and given direction. If that is the case, there are going to be greater opportunities for people to stay on and to see school as a vital link with and a vital preparation for that career or work. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been accused of suggesting that the Opposition wants to wipe out Austudy. When one hears time after time the question, `Do you think that without that system people would still make the decision to go on?' one begins to wonder. As Ben Chifley said, if someone looks like a duck, acts like a duck and is generally seen in company with ducks, it is reasonable to presume he is a duck. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide has already mentioned the instance in the Senate. If the Opposition is committed to Austudy for secondary students, let it say so clearly. I did not hear those words in the speech of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Goldstein. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the House to this notion of a voucher system. I suppose what is most depressing about the voucher system is that we have an Opposition wanting to parade something as a fresh idea but really recycling something that has been around for about 20 years. It is about 20 years since Milton Friedman first suggested vouchers. Initially, the idea of vouchers was to try to get some competition between education systems and between schools. Indeed, if one takes away the compulsory zoning of schools, one can get that competition without vouchers. But the real tragedy is that there would be, once again, a system that discriminates against those in the community who are financially weak: they would not be able to afford it. It would be great for the upper classes-they would love it-but it would set education back years, as we have seen in New South Wales. The State of New South Wales is a classic example under Dr Metherell of the education system--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to make my contribution to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. There is really only one small section of the Bill I wish to address tonight, that is, the revision of section 55 of the Student Assistance Act so that the report to Parliament will be incorporated in the annual report rather than being a separate report. I would contend to honourable members that it is simply not good enough. The report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which has been well canvassed by the honourable member for Goldstein ((Dr Kemp) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), clearly said to the Government that Austudy is in trouble; it is a system out of control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have addressed the issue of the Committee report at another time in this House and I will not continue with that. But I would like to talk about the cost of student financial assistance and the cost of the government bureaucracy. I note that all student financial assistance in Australia in this financial year is budgeted at $1.2 billion. In answer to a question on notice, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) told me that the administrative costs-that is, the cost of running the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the National Board of Education, Employment and Training, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission equals $561,929,000 a year-more than 50 per cent of the cost of Austudy: it is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> We are spending money on bureaucrats and public servants, not on students or the education system, where the money is clearly required. Last Sunday, in the Sunday Age, there was an article which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is considering radically changing or replacing the $1 billion Austudy Scheme as part of a wholesale review of student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> A Government document outlining the scope of the review highlights many criticisms of the scheme, including its impact on farming families and administrative problems such as overpayment and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of the report and the Minister is saying, `Let us go out and hire a consultant to tell us whether or not the Government should get rid of Austudy'. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been a number of criticisms of the targetting and other aspects of AUSTUDY, and pressure for change particularly with respect to older students (ie 21). </PARA>
<PARA>That is true. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, it is now timely to give consideration to whether the current scheme remains appropriate (with or without modification of some or all of the major scheme parameters) or, alternatively, whether some alternative or modified form of student income support should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Wow, what a statement! The other side has the audacity to talk about the Opposition talking about getting rid of Austudy while it is the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) who is talking about getting rid of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was proposed in the report that the consultant prepare an options paper addressing a whole range of issues. I can tell the House and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services that it is always possible to provide access without equity, but it is clearly impossible to have equity without access. Higher education costs are increasing rapidly in all advanced countries; it is not an Australian phenomenon. We in Australia are faced with the added pressures of one of the highest immigration rates in the world together with a dramatic increase in retention rates to year 12, both of which contribute to rapidly increasing demand for places in higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There has always been a limit to government expenditure in any portfolio, but the rate of increase in spending in education in the past few years has been much more rapid than in other areas of government responsibility. I do not deny that should be a priority. Any discussion of student financial assistance must, of necessity, examine the concept of public versus private benefit. Taking into account all the players, there probably should be mechanisms for cost sharing between taxpayers, students, parents, partners, institutions and employers. Equally, in order to satisfy the criterion of supplying access, the amount of public money devoted to income support must be considered in the overall Budget context. If the taxpayers must supply increasing financial assistance to students to the detriment of capital expenditure on, or recurrent expenditure for, the institutions themselves, and if, as a result, we cannot provide higher education to all those who qualify, we will not meet any test for equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate regarding student financial assistance must be framed in terms of cost sharing and in our current circumstances must take account of an increasing need for access. If Budget constraints will not allow us to provide more places and financially support more students, alternative means of financial support for students must be examined critically. Any call for reduced salaries for those given the teaching responsibility must be resisted. Quality of outcomes is of critical importance, and high equality is unlikely to be the result of low salaries and poor career opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Consideration of alternative methods for providing student financial assistance must also critically take account of the issue of equity. We must first determine our objectives and public policy goals for what we expect from higher education-such as numbers versus quality, access versus equity and specific versus generalist-and then determine how we apportion the cost. Regardless of such statement of objectives, the costs must be shared. </PARA>
<PARA> Any attempt at international comparisons in respect of student financial assistance is difficult because of major differences in data collection, priorities, lifestyles, standards of living, costs of living and community support for education in general. However, for this discussion it is useful to examine what is happening in the world around us and the directions being taken by other advanced capitalist societies in terms of financial assistance for tertiary students. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1990-91 the United Kingdom will be introducing a loans scheme which will gradually be increased as a proportion of total student support and which will eventually equal the combined contribution of parents and grants. Spain also has a grants system, but that is highly targeted to approximately only 17 per cent of students compared to Australia's Austudy, which is targeted moderately to approximately 40 per cent of students. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1971 the Federal Republic of Germany has moved from a means tested grants system to a means tested loans system, which covers 100 per cent of students. France has a highly targeted student grants system, but grants are small and available only to the very needy and assist about 10 to 12 per cent of students. Sweden, as would be expected from its extensive state welfare system, expects little from students in terms of work and no assistance whatsoever from parents or spouses. However, Swedish students have access to both loans and grants, and the role of loans relative to grants has increased significantly over the past 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States in general has a hodgepodge of systems and is quite substantially different from other major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of tertiary education. In the first instance, tuition at university is not free and fees vary from very low at public institutions to very high at private institutions. However, the point is that the United States, while it has a grants system, has rapidly moved from that to a now universal loans system, which is available to all students regardless of background or parental income and is guaranteed by the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly this country now needs, as a result of the Minister's statement and his consideration of other options, to look at other available mechanisms for supplying student financial assistance. From all I have said, it is clear that Australia stands relatively alone in the world in supporting only a grants system for public student financial assistance. The options we must consider are: firstly, continuation of Austudy; secondly, student part time work; thirdly, parental support; fourthly, institutional-that is, scholarship-support; fifthly, student loans, and, sixthly, assistance for isolated students. I maintain that we should increasingly look at student loans as an option for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer my discussion paper to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to save him the cost of consultants' fees in examining the options available and the benefits to Australian students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1991, which makes a number of amendments to the Student Assistance Act 1973. That Act is the statutory basis for the Austudy scheme. The major change which will be made to Austudy will be amendments to the administering of benefits so that benefits can only be paid once a student or means-tested parent has provided a tax file number to the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This measure is consistent with other Government policy involving data matching of client records between departments administering income maintenance schemes. This is a move which will help reduce fraud and overpayment and ensure that assistance goes to those students who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act will also be amended to restructure the late payment charges. Currently the system for repaying overpayments is inadequate and there is a low return rate. Under the new rules late payments of over three months will incur a fee of $100, and after that interest will be payable from the date of the notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Student Assistance Act being introduced in 1973, students paid tertiary fees. If they were fortunate enough, they got a Commonwealth or State scholarship. In fact, 45 per cent of students paid full fees. The Whitlam Labor Government abolished fees and introduced the tertiary education assistance scheme in 1973, which for the first time gave students from all backgrounds financial access to education. It is important to know that it was not until the election of the Hawke Labor Government that this was updated and substantial reforms to tertiary assistance were implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Student Assistance Act was amended to introduce Austudy. The three payments which come under this scheme are Austudy; Abstudy, which provides assistance to Aboriginal students; and assistance for isolated children. It is part of this Government's educational strategy to raise Australia's economic competitiveness in part by increasing the level of education and by opening up higher education to the whole of the community. Austudy's aim is to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . promote equality of educational opportunity and improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged students by breaking down the financial barriers to further participation in education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>It is anticipated that this scheme will assist almost 395,000 students in 1991, and this shows an increase of 22.6 per cent on Austudy beneficiaries since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of Austudy primarily to students from low income families is consistent with the Government's education and, for that matter, social justice policy. I grew up in a Welsh working class family and, as I have said before, I was probably the first to ever step inside a university. For the rest of my family there was no consideration of anything more than a very rudimentary education. In Australia until the 1970s things were pretty much the same. `Access' was not a word normally associated with tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA> We have made education accessible and Australians have taken the opportunity to take their education. More importantly, retention rates in secondary schools have risen from 36 per cent of students finishing year 12 in 1982 to 64 per cent in 1990. By 1992 Federal funding for schools will have increased by almost $500m in real terms to more than $2 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> This commitment to education has been paralleled in higher education, where about 70,000 additional student places will be created between 1988 and 1993. But the most important aspect of Federal Government policy is that it has opened up university education to students from a variety of backgrounds. Austudy has been integral to enabling this change to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Spending on student support has trebled since 1982-83 and is being continually refined so that it can be targeted to the most needy, as is the case with most other Federal Government income maintenance schemes. Recently the personal income test threshold was increased to enable students to provide some of their own income while still receiving benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate I have not only schools and technical and further education colleges but also two universities, one of which was recently formed as a result of further reforms to tertiary education by this Government. In my electorate office I occasionally receive requests or inquiries, or even complaints, from constituents who have difficulty with the administration of Austudy. Let me give a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA> I often encounter students who have not finished their course in the time allowed. Under the Student Assistance Act these people are then unable to claim Austudy benefits. I do not think that Austudy should be available for perpetual students to remain at university, dropping in and out at their will, and I do believe the current rules are fair. However, there are occasional cases where hardship does prevent a student from finishing a course within the required time-a course in which he or she and the community have invested pretty heavily already. The Austudy review processes do not appear to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate these kinds of awkward situations. </PARA>
<PARA> One such case was that of an adult student who had begun a course part time whilst working full time. He did not claim any benefits and was no burden on the system. He could not even claim his expenses as a tax deduction. For reasons beyond his control he was then forced to stop his course. A few years later he came to South Australia, to my electorate, and began studying full time. He applied for Austudy and was granted it for one year, but was then informed that because he had studied at the same level previously, he could only be given Austudy for one more year. I am not sure whether that is quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fellow called into my office concerned that he would be denied his benefits for some weeks. He was undertaking his education in a manner which is becoming increasingly popular with both students and institutions, that is, by studying every year to undertake a bachelor degree in three separate year-long courses which build up from a certificate eventually to a degree. Good communication with the department made it possible for him to apply for a special benefit from the Department of Social Security for the interim period, and it looks as though he will be able to continue with his course. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also sometimes a long lead time between applications being lodged and benefits being paid, which can deter potential students from going back to school if they are not getting their benefits for the first few weeks when they do not have any source of income. There have also been suggestions that 25 years of age is too old for the independent age threshold to cut in. I notice that in a survey recently conducted of Adelaide University students, which was published in the Advertiser on Monday, this complaint is lodged by the president of the students union at the University of Adelaide. Having brought up two children who are both now over the age of 25, I can see that in some instances 25 is an appropriate age and in other instances it is greatly inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am convinced that Austudy should remain a support which enables a great number of students to attend university, and prevents it from being what it was until very recently-a privilege for a small number of people to attend to gain access to very lucrative professions and incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had students come into my office complaining that their Austudy benefits have been taken away from them because of a re-evaluation of their assets. This is a difficult one. But on further checking I have found that their family farms had been valued on the voluntary evaluation at the council valuation for rateable purposes. This was a long way from the market value; in fact, it was below market value. A couple of years later when someone checked it out, it was decided that the asset was in fact worth much more than had been evaluated at the time. I sympathise with these people, but I think we need to ensure that the correct valuation on assets for an assets test purpose is undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its introduction, Austudy has undergone a continual process of review and refinement, and I note that a further review is to be undertaken. In 1988 the Australian National Audit Office conducted investigations at various DEET offices with a view to achieving changes in the administration of Austudy payments. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 May the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training undertook an inquiry into student financial assistance. Some of the problems raised by that study were to be found in the report in the Sun on 10 May 1991, which cites the ability of company directors to minimise their taxable incomes, enabling fairly high income earners to obtain Austudy for their children. So the review process which is about to be undertaken by a consultant for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) should concentrate on weeding out such potential legal frauds, if I can call them that, of the Austudy payments system. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing to recall in all this is that there is a limited amount of financial assistance available for the tertiary education sector in general and for financial assistance for students in particular. The more money that is made available to higher income and higher assets students, the less will be available for those needy who would be unable to enter what is now an accessible sector of education. They would be unable to enter it without appropriate financial assistance. So if we are not fairly strict about the administration of assets and means tests, the money that is going into that sector will not fulfil those social justice objectives, which are to look after people from disadvantaged backgrounds who have been unable to access tertiary education for the last 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Student Assistance Act, which will require students and therefore means-tested parents to quote their tax file numbers, should save the Government $7m next year. Computer matching with the Australian Taxation Office will help eliminate fraud. Coupled with other improvements to the administration of Austudy, these moves should make the scheme even more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say, in closing, that in day-to-day work in the electorate office I find that the administration of Austudy is difficult because there are so many peculiarities when people undertake tertiary education these days. I believe the scheme needs continual review and revising in order to ensure that it does the job it is supposed to do-that is, to make university and other tertiary and secondary education accessible to sectors of the population that voted in a Labor government and expect us to make it accessible to their kids and adults. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill makes changes to the various student assistance schemes, including Austudy and Abstudy. It removes the Australian postgraduate awards from coverage under the student assistance arrangements, because in future they will be funded under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The proposed amendments are not major and are generally supported but, in common with previous speakers, I wish to make a few comments about the Austudy arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will obligate applicants to provide their tax file number at the time they apply for assistance through Austudy and of course, where appropriate, parents and spouses will have to provide that kind of information. This is a further stage in the Government's plan to introduce an Australia card by stealth. It failed in its endeavours to introduce a national numbering system when the public was outraged at the lack of personal association with those sorts of numbers and data-matching arrangements. Yet we are told that the purpose of the tax file number being included in Austudy arrangements is again to do more data-matching to endeavour to stamp out cheating. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one will tolerate any kind of cheating or rorts in the Austudy system or anywhere else. That leaves us in a difficult position. Whenever we introduce such measures we limit or invade people's privacy. It is argued by others that beneficiaries of government assistance forfeit some rights. However, that is not a principle that rests easily with me. Therefore, we need to ensure that when such data-matching mechanisms are put in place there is adequate protection of privacy and an assurance that this kind of information will always remain confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy is a major program. In the 1990-91 Federal Budget, it is expected to cost $935.8m, rising to $1,152.7m in 1993-94. I guess it is our investment in `a clever country'. There are some 338,000 Austudy recipients in 1991. Forty-two per cent of all tertiary students and 36 per cent of secondary students over 16 years of age receive Austudy. Abstudy costs a further $92.7m and provides assistance to another 44,200 students. </PARA>
<PARA> The most controversial aspects of Austudy have clearly been its means test and its assets test. Under Austudy the maximum benefit is paid where there is only one dependent child and the income is below $19,300. But the benefit phases out with an income of up to $32,000 where there is a single dependent. In other circumstances the phase-out can go as high as $150,000. People with incomes as high as $150,000 still receive some kind of Austudy assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> A report on student financial assistance by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training was tabled in the House recently. The Committee made the point that the threshold at which allowances are reduced is too low. It referred to the fact that in 1974 average weekly earnings marked the beginning of the phase-down level. These days the figure is much lower than that and the Committee recommended that it should be set immediately at 75 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That would put the figure at approximately $21,000. Such a proposition is easy to support. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the real problem arises around the assets test. The amount is not phased in; it is fixed at $347,500, with a concession available to farms and businesses to allow a maximum asset of $695,000. There is a major problem with the relativity between the earning limit and the earning capacity of the assets. In the most extreme example, a business asset of $695,000 would have to return over 20 per cent per annum to trigger the income test. Few farms would return the 3 per cent necessary to trigger the lowest of the income tests. Clearly, that is a gross discrimination, particularly against the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimated that the return on farm assets last year was only 0.5 per cent and, of course, it is going to be lower. That means that with the assets test the average farm will be returning only $3,500. So a farmer earning an average of $70 per week is considered to be too rich to receive the Austudy allowance for himself or his family. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not apply to just a few farmers. The ABRAE estimated that 50 per cent of farms have a net asset of $700,000 or more, and indeed last year the average was $910,000. So clearly there is a problem in that many in the rural sector are unable to receive Austudy on an equivalent basis to those living in urban areas, because they are unable to pass the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> Many businesses are affected as well. I was disappointed that the Standing Committee recommended a phasing out of the concession for business assets because there are many business people who face similar problems to those in the rural sector. It is bad enough that the Government chooses to beat farmers and small business-its economic policy has been ruinous to those trying to contribute to productivity-but when it vents its anger on families and children and children are denied a basic education, that is a gross discrimination which should not be tolerated. Country children are already disadvantaged in terms of health services, future employment opportunity and cultural experience. If they are denied a basic education, they are placed at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, country children are significantly disadvantaged when it comes to receiving tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1990, in its higher education series, the Federal Government published an interesting report on urban and rural participation in tertiary education. The report highlighted a number of interesting points, including this one:</PARA>
<PARA> Participation in higher education among people from remote areas, per head of population, was roughly half that of people from urban areas. The participation rate for rural dwellers was slightly higher than for remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>So the people who come from rural and remote areas-and that is the vast majority of Australia-have only half as much chance of receiving a tertiary education as those who come from urban areas. The report points out that the majority of students, from all three regions, were enrolled full time. However, the proportion enrolled part time was much higher from rural and remote areas. It stated that over three-quarters of Australian higher education students in 1989 came from urban areas, with 19 per cent from rural locations and 3 per cent from remote areas. The definition of `remote' in the report included about 80 per cent of Australia, including cities such as Townsville and Cairns. It is interesting to note that of all the students coming from remote areas, around half come from Queensland. The James Cook University alone provides around a quarter of those students coming from remote areas. So clearly there is a major disadvantage applying to country students. They have only half as much opportunity to enter tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognised this when it published its Fair Chance For All report last year. In that series there was one booklet devoted to people from rural and isolated areas. The Government, in that report, acknowledged that school leavers in rural areas transfer to higher education at consistently lower rates than their city counterparts. So the problem has been recognised by the Government in a number of its reports. The facts, which are quite clear and quite obvious, are beyond dispute. I think that, in a community which believes in equity and a fair go for all, this is something that Australians should not tolerate. It is no wonder that there is a shortage of doctors, lawyers, architects and other professionals in country areas when there are so few students from those areas entering tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of reasons for the poor share of country people's participation in tertiary education-the Government's own reports outline some of them-but, without doubt, the major factor is financial: the inability of farm families and rural families to meet the extra cost of sending their children off to a far away city for tertiary education experience. In many instances the needs are more desperate than that; the children have to stay home to help on the property to help ensure that that basic unit survives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government boasts a commitment to fairness, equity and social justice. This is one of the most blatant inequities in our society and it needs to be rectified. I regard it as unacceptable that the children in my electorate have only half as much chance, on average, of getting a tertiary education as students from metropolitan electorates. I believe that a government which is serious about equity and fairness must take urgent action to ensure that this wrong is corrected. We need effective student assistance measures which are able to achieve these kinds of objectives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), in speaking to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, referred to his criticisms of the Austudy arrangements. Some of them, relating to the rural sector, were covered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. There is some validity in some of those matters, but one of the things he talked about, which I take very strong issue with, was his suggestion that the arrangements for the student assistance scheme are not effectively targeted and that the threshold should be raised. The comment that he was making was the opposite of what the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) was saying earlier in the debate and in a number of other comments where he has bemoaned the fact that so many people are in receipt of Austudy. On 19 September in the House last year, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is a scheme which is supposed to assist those who would otherwise not undertake further study, but 42 per cent of all tertiary students receive it. </PARA>
<PARA>He has gone on to say similar things. He has not made too many comments on it, but the comments he has made have been very negative about whether the scheme should continue at all. Senator Kemp, in the other place, has gone as far as advocating that in the field of education the money spent on Austudy could be directed better to other areas. In other words, he was suggesting that we should go back to the old days, abolish the scheme altogether, and make the provision of, and access to, higher education and senior secondary education something that people who are in any way disadvantaged-those who come from poor family circumstances or who have other disabilities in getting access to education-do not have the opportunity to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> That seems to be what the Opposition is advocating. It has always been hostile to schemes which are built on the principles of equality, fairness and giving everyone the opportunity to have access to education. There is no greater means for most people-particularly those from working class areas such as the western suburbs of Sydney-to get a chance to develop and achieve their full aspirations in life than an effective and comprehensive education. Repeatedly we see that undermined by the approach that the Opposition in this place takes and, particularly, by the approach that we have seen the Greiner Government take in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of salient facts here. Some of the most important ones relate to the fact that in the time of the Hawke Labor Government the number of students completing secondary education has doubled. Using the best set of statistics, in areas such as the western part of Sydney, only one in three-if they were lucky-completed secondary education. The figure is now two in three. The students now also have the opportunity to go on to higher education, which they are completing in larger numbers all the time. That has been due largely to the significant resources that we have devoted to the education portfolio, in terms of the student assistance schemes, the number of places that we have funded within institutions and the development of new institutions such as the University of Western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I think everyone would acknowledge-and some people opposite criticise it-that there has been an increase in expenditure on education under this Government. For the first time in areas of high growth population, such as the western suburbs of Sydney, those students now have higher education institutions. They are now given those opportunities. Under the Fraser Government, talk of development of a university in western Sydney would have been the furthest thing from people's minds. They would never have contemplated the idea that people from the western suburbs of Sydney would actually desire or seek to go on to university. That campaign has been run and won by the Australian Labor Party to ensure that there was a university there so that we could have equal opportunity and access for students who aspire to go on to complete higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other salient points is that there is a wealth of statistics showing that families in which people who have completed university are more likely to have their children go on and complete education as well. That sort of ethos of the opportunity and the development of education is largely only developed by people who have families or others who have a commitment to the process. It is only because of the development of a university in a geographical area such as western Sydney that those objectives are really achieved. That has meant that more resources need to be devoted. It will mean, as population increases in western Sydney faster than anywhere else in urban areas throughout Australia, that more resources have to be devoted to higher education in that region just to keep up with a per capita growth rate. That will be a challenge for the Government which I am sure it will match. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, in looking at Austudy, to ensure that it is a scheme that fundamentally promotes the principle of fairness and gives opportunities to people who, historically, would never have had the chance to go on to university or complete secondary education. There were many disincentives built into the system in the old days, under the system where the question of means was not the issue that really determined whether people got assistance or not. The system is only fair and equitable if a comprehensive set of Austudy arrangements are put in place. That is what we have done. We recognise that the whole area of training is crucial and that is why so many of the Government's initiatives are directed towards training and skills development. That is a fundamental part of our whole approach in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare that with the sort of comment that the honourable member for Wide Bay was making when he suggested that the changes in this legislation were just an attempt to introduce the Australia Card by stealth. That is how he referred to it. I cannot understand how anyone could have the breadth of imagination to come to the conclusion that, because one wants to ensure that those people who get Austudy are the ones who are entitled to it, there is anything fundamentally wrong with that principle when, at the same time, those opposite say that they would really like to introduce vouchers for education and also say repeatedly that there should be fiscal restraint and massive cuts in public expenditure, which is part of their alternative budgetary agenda. We are trying to ensure that the scheme is clean, has adequate compliance and at the same time provides the opportunity for everyone who really needs Austudy assistance to get it and to use that financial means to complete their university or senior secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is saying that it does not want to ensure that only those who are entitled to assistance get it. That is what the honourable member for Wide Bay is saying. Other people say it should be targeted more precisely. It is a fundamental contradiction in the position the Opposition is putting. It is something that the Opposition needs to explain as it develops a policy, which it clearly does not have at the moment, in the field of the Austudy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to the debate when the House of Representatives Standing Committee was producing its report. One of the notable things about that debate was that only one or two people from the Opposition participated, yet they all signed their names to the document that actually came out, which did not give it a lot of credibility. The fact that the honourable member for Goldstein actually goes through the process of finding every fault he thinks exists in Austudy suggests that the real agenda of the Opposition is to scrap it altogether so that people from poor and needy families, whose only chance to get to complete their education--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Chifley says, these families come from areas such as the western suburbs of Sydney. The only chance they get to complete their education is because there is a scheme such as Austudy in place. If we do not have that, they simply do not get an education and we go back to the old days, presumably, when less than one in three of those people completed secondary schooling. That was the Fraser Government's record. That was its legacy. It did not just leave us with a great rate of unemployment, but fundamentally it said that people from anywhere west of Parramatta in Sydney did not have the expectation to go on to university and it was not something that they should aspire to. The honourable member for Chifley referred to that earlier in the debate. It is shameful that people in this place should have the power to determine whether those people who live in areas such as western Sydney actually get the chance to have a full and comprehensive education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another point that needs to be made about this area. As I said earlier, we have seen the attack by the Greiner Government in New South Wales on educational opportunity. It paraded it as an attempt to improve education standards, yet there would not be a school or a teacher in any of the western part of Sydney who could actually claim that fewer teachers, fewer choices of subjects and fewer opportunities for students somehow have improved educational standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act constitutes the statutory basis for what we now know as the Austudy scheme. One of the major provisions in this Bill is that assistance will be paid only when students have provided their tax file numbers to the Department. The requirement will also apply to parents or spouses if the means test applies to the parents or spouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is opportune to go over a brief part of the history of Austudy. The present Austudy scheme succeeded the old tertiary education assistance scheme in 1984. It has always been income tested. However, the assets test for Austudy began in January 1989. The scheme is designed to ensure that those whose parental or personal income is less than $33,000 per annum and whose assets are less than $340,000 are assisted in their quest for further education beyond the age of 16. These income asset limits are indexed annually. Farmers and small businessmen are allowed to devalue their assets by 50 per cent. Consequently, their net asset value can be approximately $700,000. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems of the Austudy program has been that the Labor Government has never established any clear policy objectives on what it was trying to do with financial assistance for students. This has been borne out in many ways, none more pointedly than the rural inequities study which was prepared by the Bendigo College of Advanced Education, now the University College of Northern Victoria. An excellent report prepared by Dr Doug Lloyd and his colleagues at that institution highlighted the inequities for rural students under the Austudy scheme. The Government quite successfully tried to suppress this report for many months and would not let it come to light. However, fortunately, a copy of the report found its way into my hands and I was able to read into Hansard many of the recommendations in respect of the inequities which the study had found. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those issues have also been addressed by the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Student Financial Assistance, which was tabled in the House in March 1991. The report also identified the matter that I have referred to regarding the Government's lack of clear policy objectives for student financial assistance. It is regrettable that the Government did not establish those objectives right from the outset of the Austudy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In many areas of Australia, particularly rural areas, many students have been at a disadvantage for many years in their efforts to seek tertiary education, whether it be in the metropolitan area or in a country based tertiary institution. The parents of those students have always faced the additional cost of finding accommodation for their son or daughter in the metropolitan area or in a large country centre so that their children could obtain the advantages of tertiary study. That has imposed tremendous financial pressures on parents and also on the students. They are already at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the inequities which were identified in the rural inequities study highlighted the problems that country students have in obtaining access to Austudy, particularly when many farmers had what appeared to be large assets. In fact, whilst they looked as though they had substantial assets, their actual income was very modest. They were having great difficulty in being able to receive the Austudy support which was so necessary to support those students. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that have been made over a period of time have not had a great deal of impact on the way the Austudy scheme has been administered. The report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training highlighted many of the administration problems that were the result of a flawed blueprint right from the outset of the Austudy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Outlays for student assistance have grown at quite a remarkable rate. They have grown at an average annual rate of 6.9 per cent since 1980-81. This growth reflects the increasing number of secondary and tertiary students becoming eligible for assistance. The increased maximum rates of allowances as student payments were aligned with employment benefit rates in 1988. In 1990-91 the Budget provided $1.233 billion for student assistance, including $935.8m for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to increase the savings from the administration of the Student Assistance Act and strengthen the safeguards against fraud. The Government estimates savings to be approximately $8m-$7m from the tax file number requirement and associated package involving data comparison, and $1m from the restructuring of the data proposal change. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention some of the issues that the Standing Committee found in its recommendations in the report which was tabled in this House. The situation for rural people is particularly highlighted in recommendation 7. The Committee, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) as Deputy Chairman, made a number of recommendations. Recommendation 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government examine additional means by which assistance can be provided to rural families to assist with the education of their children, particularly through the introduction of a tapered assets test and the introduction of a rural loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the problem I have been talking about. This report has been in the Parliament for some time now, and I still have not seen any positive action from the Government on the implementation of many of its recommendations. The earlier study that I mentioned-the rural inequities study-also had a number of issues which required Government action. Very few of those actions have been taken by the Hawke Labor Government to implement some of the improvements to the scheme. There are still many problems in the administration of the scheme; in fact, every day in my Bendigo electorate office, we would have several Austudy complaints and inquiries, even at this point. There seems to have been a dramatic lack of training and assistance by the Government to the employees of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) in performing their task, and it has made it very difficult for the employees of DEET to carry out the administration of the Austudy program. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not cast any blame on the staff who have been battling under enormous odds. One of the problems is that they have been absolutely overwhelmed and swamped with inquiries; in fact, it got so bad that the staff found that they had to remove the phone from the hook because of the massive number of inquiries being received. In their efforts to try to assist people, hopefully that phone service will be improved, because it was one of the major issues identified in the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Student Financial Assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should have a very close look at the recommendations in that report and start implementing them. If they are implemented, they will overcome many of the problems currently involved in the Austudy program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) in this debate earlier were interesting in their hypocrisy at least. He outlined the Opposition's support for education and the principle of broad access to education. He indicated the Opposition's laudable support for the concept that finance should not be a barrier to such access. However, history tells a different story on the Opposition's support for student assistance and on its willingness to outlay moneys on education places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our memories on this side of the House are not so hazy that we forget the attempts by members of the Opposition, when in government, to reduce the level of student assistance in the form of the tertiary education assistance scheme (TEAS), to reduce access to education by students, and to increase the charges in such a way as to remove the opportunity for students from lower income families to attend higher education. Under their Government, no significant assistance was available to high school students to stay on at school, and no attempt was made to bring in the assistance required for them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote to the House a couple of passages from a speech made some time ago in this place. It is appropriate since we are talking about reports tonight. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer Government members to a report commissioned by the Government which points to the fact that the reason why there has been a continual drift, in the view of the committee, towards people from more privileged backgrounds getting into universities and college has been the decline in the value of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance and the restrictions in the eligibility for it. The report indicates that the number of students who are not in receipt of any public support at all doubled from 21 per cent to 41 per cent during 1974 to 1979. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, this suggests that the shift in the full-time student population towards financing by parents-or by themselves-has led to a relative decrease in full-time university and CAE students from less privileged backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> That has happened during the term of this Government. The cause of that continual regressive shift has been identified as the failure of the Government to maintain the value of TEAS and the eligibility for it. </PARA>
<PARA>That quote came from the Hansard of 9 December 1982. The speaker was the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). Needless to say, he was not the Minister at that time. In that same contribution, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I just want to say that the Government has recently been presented with what constitutes an extraordinary indictment of its education policies in relation to declining participation rates in schools and in higher education. The report entitled `Learning and Earning' might have included the word yearning too, because in this country I am sure we have an enormous untapped talent which is yearning for an opportunity to participate effectively in the education process. But people are simply not doing so. They are deserting our educational institutions in droves. There is an enormous flight from learning which this Government has not begun to appropriately address. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have a very serious problem in this country. If we are trying to provide the sorts of skills which we obviously need and if we are to have any sort of economic recovery-anything that means anything-to provide the sort of job opportunities for people in the future, we are not going to do it with an undereducated population. </PARA>
<PARA>That quote indicates that the Minister has been consistent in his position on education in trying to establish the principles that would allow people from low income families and underprivileged backgrounds to enter the education system in this country at whatever level they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say that the Opposition has been consistent in the same way, and I regret that a situation exists where we are being criticised for opening up the education system in this country. It was Gough Whitlam's Labor Government which introduced the student assistance measures outlined in the parent Act of 1973 and promoted the concept of free tertiary education as a means of increasing the access by people from low income families to education. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a report on student financial assistance in March 1991. I draw the attention of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) to the date of the report-it was not that long ago for the Government to have responded. I was a member of that Committee. I think most of the members of the Committee took their job very seriously. We criticised the administration of Austudy-there is no question about that. We also criticised the absence of clear objectives for the scheme which would form the basis of any evaluation of Austudy's success in meeting those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that there has never been an objective; rather the objective seems to have shifted somewhat over time and needs to be restated so as to enable a proper evaluation of the scheme's effectiveness. Anecdotal evidence indicates that Austudy is providing substantial assistance to many people, including young people, who are now able to make the decision to stay on to year 12 at school. In the context of Austudy effectiveness, I draw the attention of the House to chapter 2 of the report on student financial assistance, and indicate that although the national union of students claimed that one of the basic problems was that there had never been a comprehensive statement by the Commonwealth as to what the policy intentions were for either TEAS or Austudy, it did appear that, when the program was established, its intention was to meet the basic living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> That position can be maintained because the Minister, when introducing the legislation in 1973, observed that student allowances ought to be sufficient to give students the leisure to think as they pursued their studies. In evidence to the Standing Committee, the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) indicated that the stated objective of Austudy was to overcome financial barriers to the continuation of secondary and tertiary education by providing income support to financially disadvantaged students undertaking full time studies, and that the specific program goals were to increase overall retention rates in the post-compulsory secondary school years and participation rates in tertiary education, and higher education participation rates of the financially disadvantaged. I am sure that most honourable members in this House would agree with those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> DEET also advised the Standing Committee that in order to assess the effectiveness of Austudy against its objectives, two key areas needed to be considered. The first was the take-up rate by eligible students, and to a lesser extent the coverage of Austudy, and the second was the effect of Austudy on secondary retention and completion rates and tertiary participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> So DEET did provide information which in its view indicated that the aim of improving access to education was almost certainly being met. We had an appendix in the report which showed that participation rates in all education sectors are increasing and have in fact accelerated following the introduction of Austudy in 1987. In recent years Australia has been experiencing rapidly increasing year 12 retention rates and completion rates as a result of increases in secondary and tertiary participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Those things have not come about by accident. They have come about through the targeting of Austudy to people from families of low incomes, and I know that in my electorate, as indeed in your electorate of Stirling, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have seen considerable improvements in participation rates of young people attending year 12 and completing year 12 in high school. Those sorts of indicators are the indicators we have to look at if we are to assess the effectiveness of Austudy in assisting people to stay in education. </PARA>
<PARA> Another indicator of the relative effectiveness of Austudy in achieving its objectives of improving education outcomes is the estimated year 12 completion rate, which is different from the retention rate measure. One of the graphs in the report also shows that the overall completion rate increased substantially between 1984 and 1989, going from 43 per cent to 58 per cent, and that these completion rates are clearly increasing for each socio-economic status level. </PARA>
<PARA> Those figures are a bit difficult to comprehend in toto, but I think it is important to get them on the record because Austudy is working, at least as far as I can tell, and basically I and many other members of the Committee have no argument with the concept of Austudy, but only with the difficulty in ascertaining the efficacy of its targeting, given the reluctance in the past, I suppose, of people to actually establish the objective in an ongoing sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Like my colleagues, I would want to see Austudy eligibility criteria made more simple and to ensure that it is directed principally to members of low income families who might not otherwise be able to continue on to year 12 at high school or to take up the opportunity of technical and further education or indeed university. </PARA>
<PARA> I would join with the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) in indicating that I believe that Austudy is a fundamental element in the promotion of a fairer society in Australia, and I commend to the House this Bill, which is designed to improve the administration of Austudy in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1991 is not of itself particularly momentous; however, it does raise once again the very important issue of student financial assistance. This evening we have therefore had a full and broad ranging debate on this very important subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the House that we on the Opposition side believe that education is absolutely vital. In our view it has become an absolutely critical policy area in recent times, as we have come to realise how important it is that Australia does in fact become an intelligent country. So, for us, we see it as critical; and we see, of course, as we look at the current scheme, many deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has moved an amendment which in effect says that, while we will support the Bill because it does represent some improvements to the scheme, we deplore the Government's continued mismanagement of education and in particular we deplore the Government's failure to define clear objectives for the implementation and operation of the student assistance programs, the Government's failure to administer student assistance programs in a financially responsible manner and the failure of the Government to structure and administer student assistance programs so that they operate in a fair and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) was a member, as she mentioned, would be able to support the amendment. The honourable member for Cowan, the Chairman, who spoke earlier-that is, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price)-and other Committee members who have spoken in this debate could not but support that amendment because the Committee's report clearly condemned Austudy in so many different aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> We were faced with an Auditor-General's report of 1990 which brought down 124 recommendations which highlighted many deficiencies in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's administration of Austudy, including the fact that there were millions and millions of dollars in overpayments and the potential for millions and millions of dollars of fraud occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> So I challenge the members of that Committee. I even note that the honourable member for Chifley had the gall to criticise the Vice-Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), for having the temerity to criticise Minister Dawkins. I will not hold back from criticising him. I have described in this place time after time the number of Dawkins disasters that we have witnessed during the period that he has been in office. I could list them if I had time. There would be 20 or 30 on a long list of what I call Dawkins disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation is overdue in that it does address some obvious deficiencies. As I have said, the Opposition supports this measure. However, we reiterate our concern about whether Austudy is in fact going to those who need it most. There is no assurance at all that it is being correctly targeted. That was one of the essential features of the report by the Employment, Education and Training Committee. We were astounded to find that there were no clear objectives for Austudy, and because of that, of course, there was no real indication that its effectiveness had ever been properly assessed. We are talking here about a Government program in which $1.2 billion has been allocated in 1990-91 and there is no guarantee that the Committee could see-and certainly none that we on our side of the House can see-that that money is being used effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Cowan mentions the fact that the Government has decided to give Austudy to secondary students, and the cost of that alone in 1990-91 will be $350m-odd; yet there is no indication at all that it is achieving anything other than adding to the incomes of those families of the children who are getting it. There is no hard evidence that it is contributing to keeping kids at school at all, and to the extent that they do stay at school, they are staying at school because they are getting Austudy but they are not really staying there to achieve anything; they tend in some cases to be disruptive and their attendance records tend to be a bit spasmodic. There is a strong suggestion in the report that the payment of Austudy to secondary students is not achieving anything at all; yet we are talking there about the expenditure of $350m. </PARA>
<PARA> There obviously needs to be a very careful reassessment of the whole area of Austudy. It is an area of significant and increasing cost, in fact; there is an increasing cost element. It is vital that the scheme has clear objectives and be properly targeted. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this evening the honourable member for Goldstein tabled a brief for a review of Austudy which has been commissioned by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I would like to refer very briefly to that particular document, because it is very interesting, it is very enlightening. What do we find here? Let us put this in the context of the hollow criticism we have heard from the Government side of the House that the Opposition is about destroying Austudy and that the Opposition undervalues the importance of student financial assistance. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we recognise the importance of making sure that everyone has access to education. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard people on our side of the House express particular concerns about the problems of access for young country people. That is a particular concern of ours. So we are concerned about making sure that every young person in this country has an opportunity to stay at school to get a proper secondary education and then go on to tertiary education, whether it be in the tertiary and further education (TAFE) sector or in the university sector. So we are concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important policy area for us. As we carry out a substantial review of student financial assistance, I believe that we will bring forward a policy that is credible, workable, fair and equitable and will achieve the objectives which we will set for it. I want to refer again to the review of Austudy. This interesting document says:</PARA>
<PARA>Against this background, it is now timely to give consideration to whether the current scheme remains appropriate (with or without modification of some or all of the major scheme parameters) or, alternatively, whether some alternative or modified form of student income support should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Is not that interesting? This document has been tabled by the honourable member for Goldstein. The Department of Employment, Education and Training provided a brief to consultants for a review of Austudy. The document implies, in the words that I have just referred to, that there is a need to review the whole scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Goldstein says, in effect it is calling for something perhaps completely different. Members on this side of the House are thinking laterally about the issue. We recognise the deficiencies in Austudy. Our amendment homes right in on that. We condemn the Government for its failure to define clear objectives for the implementation and operation of student assistance programs. So we are looking for solutions to the problem. We are committed to education. We are committed to making sure that all kids in Australia who want an education can have access to education. We are serious about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) observed in his second reading speech, a major provision of this Bill is the requirement that students provide their tax file numbers to the Department before they receive assistance. In the remaining couple of minutes that I have, I would like to sound a note of caution about this process. Putting aside the fact that this will require many students to apply for a tax file number-and that is probably not such a big deal-it does, nevertheless, raise the broader issue of what the Government is attempting to achieve by virtue of its tax file number requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the original purpose of the tax file number has changed. It is now very much more like a profile number or a Clayton's Australia Card. The tax file number has now become a powerful personal identification element and I believe that its extension should be viewed with caution. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this Bill, we now see the interaction that will take place between taxation and social security. We can see the effect that that may have in this case if it leads to the reduction of fraud and overpayment and the detection of people who are ripping off the system. After all, that should be a very important element of the monitoring of the program. We should make sure that people are not ripping off the system. If this is the case, there may be some commendable features in using that process. But I sound this note of warning: the trend of extending the use of the tax file number may ultimately result in abuse. I think there is a considerable amount of concern in the community that that may well be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been very pleased to be able to participate in this debate. I reiterate that for us on this side of the House, education is a priority area. There is no doubt as far as we are concerned that if Australia is to become an intelligent country, greater attention and emphasis must be placed on education. We are strongly committed to coming up with a student financial assistance package which works, that has clear objectives and that can be clearly evaluated for its effectiveness. </PARA>

<PARA>The effect of these amendments is to delete the proposed amendment put forward by the Government which would relieve the Government of the necessity to report annually to the Parliament separately on the operation of the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Government's proposal would be to absorb the report on the operation of the Act into the annual report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This seems to us to be exceedingly undesirable at the present time. There may be a case for such an absorption at some time but the student assistance schemes of the Government are at the moment under quite serious question. Reference was made during the second reading debate to the fact that a parliamentary committee has raised questions of the most fundamental kind about the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself has quietly commissioned a consultant's report on student assistance. It is asking in that report that the consultant advise it on the objectives of the student assistance schemes. It has left open the possibility that the report may recommend some scheme that is completely different from the current Austudy scheme. So let us hear no more cant from the Government about the Opposition being dissatisfied with Austudy. Let us hear no more misleading and deceiving statements that are coming from the Government side that the Opposition wishes to abolish Austudy. The Government itself has put the future of Austudy on the line in commissioning this report from a consultant. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these circumstances, it is important that the Parliament receives full and adequate reporting each year on the operation of the Government's student assistance programs. We believe that it will not do that if this report is absorbed into the annual report of the Department. Accordingly, I have moved on behalf of the Opposition that the Government's proposed amendment be deleted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you very much for this opportunity to speak, brief though it may be. I congratulate the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) on his commonsense in accepting the Opposition's recommendation for revision of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. It is particularly important that we consider it in the light of the information given to me today by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). That information is that the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), spends over $535m per year in administrative costs. I note that the expense for Austudy is only some $900m, so more than 50 per cent of the amount of money that we spend on student financial assistance in this country is consumed by the bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have maintained over and over again in this place, and I will continue to do so, that it is an overloaded bureaucracy at both Federal and State level that is denying students places in tertiary and secondary education in our country. Access has become an important and critical issue in this debate about education around our country. We talk constantly about equity, but I maintain again and again that there is no equity without access. If an education cannot be obtained, if there are no places available, it matters not whether we provide financial assistance, a million teachers or any other services to our students who may want to go on and help contribute to an advanced Australian society if those students cannot study because of lack of funds and lack of government provision of support services. Again, there is no equity without access. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I congratulate the Minister; I thank the Minister for his good commonsense. At least we will continue to have in this place a report by the Department of Employment, Education and Training on this most critical issue which is of major national importance-that is, student financial assistance. The direction that we are going to take in the future is of course now completely up in the air as a result of the paper of the Minister and the Department-a paper which gives to a consultant the opportunity to provide to the Government information on the direction we will head in the future. Since we are now to examine the whole issue of how we support our students, that gives us the opportunity to examine Austudy-not just the technical aspects of Austudy or whether it is meaningful in its objectives, but the whole issue of equity and access. I contend that that debate will rage for some time in this place and in the broader community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish there were more honourable members here at this hour of the night to recognise just what this Government has done. I have here a folio which is a fair representation of the amount of work that has been done on the Copyright Amendment Bill by my own office and myself to date. It is, to put it mildly, quite outrageous that a second reading debate on this measure is being guillotined and that a Bill has taken from at least December 1989, when the previous Attorney-General announced by way of press release the intention to introduce measures of reform-the Bill having been introduced in October 1990-until now to be debated, together with 13 amendments from the Government to its own Bill and amendments that I will move at the second reading stage and in the committee stage. We have been guillotined, with less than two hours on both sides. Indeed, the story is worse than I have mentioned, for the Bill stems from a referral in 1983 to the Copyright Law Review Committee which reported in September 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In effect, on a measure which has taken nearly eight years to come on for a second reading debate, there is less than two hours to consider the Bill, plus the 13 Government amendments to its own Bill, plus the Opposition amendments. If ever there were an example of the disgraceful regard in which this Executive holds this Parliament, it is summed up in the Copyright Amendment Bill. I regard this as a crucial piece of legislation. It signals a new way forward for those who want to take it but little regard is being paid to the elements of debate or to the various bodies in the community who have an interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I will get on because I have to keep brief my remarks in this second reading debate, instead of being allowed the normal period of time that the Opposition spokesman would have in dealing with this matter. If I take the full period allocated to me, namely, half an hour, it will leave very limited time for the other speakers to participate in this debate. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has put a lot of work into this measure, as he so frequently does. He will have to curtail his remarks. I trust that Government members will do the same so that the amendments being moved by the Government and Opposition can at least get some time. I envisage that in an hour or so we will be racing those amendments through with hardly any explanation of just what is involved in such a crucial piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Opposition's point of view, the former honourable member for Menzies, Mr Neil Brown, who was my predecessor as shadow Attorney-General, introduced in this Parliament in 1989 a private member's Bill which reflected the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC). Had that Bill been picked up by the Government at that time, we would have had almost two years of new legislation in place. But no, there was further delay, with the glacial speed of this Government in regard to law reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my predecessor introduced that measure, which really represented Opposition policy at that time, we have now had the opportunity to consider in detail the later Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) inquiry into books. The Prices Surveillance Authority's inquiry and its report have been accepted by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA found against the outmoded, protected regime and called for significant deregulation. In the short time available to me, I have to say that we believe a concerted effort should be made to implement the PSA recommendations. I use the term `concerted effort' because, filled with reforming zeal as the PSA was, it did tend to gloss over some of the apparent impediments that appear at this juncture to be in the way of the implementation of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> These impediments at the international level are impediments in the way of immediate implementation. I stress the words `immediate implementation of the PSA recommendations', but they ought not to be impediments through the full period of time. These impediments revolve around the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and the United States Trade Act. Nevertheless, interested parties-and there are many, with many and varied views-should note that we on this side of the House, having had extensive investigation of the matter, are committed to the Prices Surveillance Authority recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many interests over and above the fundamental interests that we, at the end of the day, came down in favour of, namely, the consumers themselves, who assisted me with their views and put them forward; and I am very grateful for that. But I did find it somewhat frustrating at the end of the day in regard to this particular industry that there is just no consistent viewpoint. The viewpoints are heterogeneous; they reflect the particular vested interest that is speaking to one at the time and in many instances totally conflict one with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be moving at the conclusion of this speech an in-principle second reading amendment reflecting our support for the Prices Surveillance Authority. I should at this juncture foreshadow that I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to, among other things, extend the Bill's operation to other copyright articles. At the end of the debate, however, we will not be opposing the Bill before us as it does represent some improvement to and an opening up of the current closed market, inadequate though the Bill is. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the report of the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) was qualified and guarded. Perhaps this was inevitable, bearing in mind its composition. By that, I do not mean a broad-brush attack on those heavily qualified in the law, but generally they approach reform of society and reform of laws in a cautious manner-in contrast to what I will touch on with regard to the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The CLRC, faced with the question whether it should recommend the complete repeal of the copyright provisions so that there would be an open market for imported publications, which would in effect deny the operation of the Copyright Act, decided against such a course. The Prices Surveillance Authority, however, was nowhere near as half-hearted and its report, I suppose, reads like a libertarian's charter. It recommended the complete abolition of the copyright provisions which prevent the open flow of overseas published books to Australia. The PSA also argued that, although its recommendations related only to books, the copyright argument applied also to other areas, particularly to sound recordings. It was later to examine this area and it upheld its earlier views. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier in this succinct appraisal, we support now the PSA recommendations. We believe that Australia should not shirk from seeking the first open market for books in the English speaking world. It is disgraceful. The more one reviews this matter, the more firmly is one moved to believe that it is disgraceful that in the latter part of the twentieth century the controls of the colonial past still operate on this country. It is disgraceful that Australians should have delayed for distribution-if at all-books from overseas. It is disgraceful that their availability is at the whim of international publishers. And it is disgraceful-as the PSA report found-that Australian prices are, for example, more than 31 per cent above United Kingdom prices. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get unduly jingoistic and I am not going to, but no Australian should have to tolerate this. Under us, no Australian will have to tolerate it. I am just not going to wear, and my Party is not going to wear, a situation where Australians are denied access as a consequence of a closed market which has its germination in a period long gone, not only in terms of the right of consumers, which ought to compel one to this view, but in terms of the industry's own efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is fair dinkum about opening up markets, if it is really intent on putting a scythe through protective mechanisms, freeing up systems and embarking on a real charter of micro-economic reform, that alone ought compel it to that view-in fact, that may be the overriding point of view. But from my point of view, I say to the Government that I, having now looked at this at some great length, find it distasteful that Australians have to tolerate a situation which has been fine for those on the gravy train, but which for those consumers who have to pay through the nose-and for those who, in some instances, cannot even pay for the books because they are simply not made available-is not only an abject and disgraceful aberration but also flies in the face of the need for a more competitive, liberal trading program. It ought to be part of the Government's program of micro-economic reform, but of course it is not. Mercifully, however, it is part of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, however, making some changes. The Bill will, therefore, be supported by us after we seek to move various amendments because it certainly is an improvement-awkward compromise though it may be between the CLRC and the PSA. I would say that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has probably struggled manfully, as I have, with all the representations and all the detail of this intricate area. Because of the respect I have for him, I am sure that he has wanted at the end of the day, at the very least, to do something better for consumers, even if his Government is not prepared to embark on the programs of micro-economic reform that we would. Nevertheless, awkward though the compromise is, we will be supporting the Bill that he has presented. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem has been with us a long time and it is really up to this Parliament to correct it. A small step is taken in this direction with this legislation. In terms of how long it has been, I refer to a High Court case fairly recently-back in 1977-which in terms of the colonial vestiges of appendages that are still binding us at this moment goes way back further than that. In 1977, in the leading case of Interstate Parcel Express Co. Pty Ltd and Time Life International (Nederlands) B.V., a report of which can be found in volume 138 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 534, the High Court found that reliance upon the importation provisions by copyright owners may give rise to concerns of the type that I have been discussing. For example, at page 555 of the report, we find Mr Justice Stephen, as he then was, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>There is, then, no novelty in the view that direct infringement of copyright results from the importation of material which until imported infringed no copyright and may indeed have originated with the plaintiff copyright owner. Any undesirable economic or cultural effects which some may discern as flowing from this aspect of copyright protection are a matter for the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct, and the legislature is taking some steps here this evening. That is the task, therefore, that we are charged with tonight. We are going about the task after having had the benefit of considering the data, findings and recommendations that have been produced by the various inquiries. I reiterate that, had the Bill of the former member for Menzies, Mr Brown, been supported by the Government, we would by now have also had the benefit of some practical experience of reform over an 18 months to two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding in this limited time I note that it is interesting in the Time Life case that the late Mr Justice Murphy also intimated that there was a need for reform in this area. However, rather than modifying the level of protection offered by the importation provisions, which is what we are advocating here, Mr Justice Murphy thought it would be more appropriate to seek redress in the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I do not proffer this viewpoint with a strong degree of support because, as I say, I think we have to have an onslaught on the levels of protection, but it was interesting that Mr Justice Murphy addressed this particular area in the following way, for at page 561 of the report His Honour indicated that it should be incumbent upon copyright holders who choose to rely upon the importation provisions firstly to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . demonstrate that the Trade Practices Act was not being breached, that the public interest was not being injured and that the enforcement of copyright by the relief sought would not be used to breach the Act or injure the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Murphy made those comments after finding that the evidence in that case suggested:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Australian public will suffer if the respondents [that is, the copyright owners] succeed, that the copyright is being used to manipulate the Australian market, and that the respondents will control the outlets, and the price to the public will almost be doubled, and the Australian public will have delayed access to publications freely available in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting view and comments which are akin to those I have made in regard to the closed market. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel bound, regrettably, to curtail my remarks on this extraordinarily important Bill. I think honourable members are aware that I give a lot of thought and detail to second reading debates on significant legislative changes. I end as I began: it is this disgraceful implementation of the guillotine that requires this if other members are also to have a say and if the Government itself is able to make the amendments necessary to its view. I curtail my remarks because of the guillotine in the hope that there will be time to deal adequately with the amendments at the committee stage. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all the words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the anti-competitive protection that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 give to the trade and distribution of copyright articles should be removed by the repeal of those provisions and, to this end, calls upon the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) pursue in the international negotiations by Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the promotion of a uniform and universal regime for the protection of, and trade in, intellectual property rights; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) seek clarification of and, if necessary, amendment to the Berne Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright Convention with respect to the application or otherwise of the provisions of those conventions to trade and distribution in the intellectual property rights''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The need for access and availability to textbooks is an integral part of furthering one's education, and I am pleased to speak in support of legislation which, among other things, will do much to free up the supply of textbooks to Australia's students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this claim can be made confidently, given the detail of the two reports which immediately preceded the drafting of the legislation; these being the Copyright Law Review Committee's investigation in September 1988 into the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 and the inquiry in late 1989 by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) into book prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal Copyright Act impacts upon many facets of our education system, from the block moneys required to be paid by schools to publishers for the multiple copying of certain texts to the amounts incorporated in the cost of imported texts which has a tendency to make them restrictive to the reader, both through their relatively high cost and the limited numbers imported. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently the importance of the Prices Surveillance Authority in protecting the Australian consumer has been displayed with the monitoring of petrol prices during the Gulf conflict and a detailed investigation into the price of musical recordings in Australia. Significantly it was just as important that the Authority's interim report into book prices set the scene, in August 1989, for considerable debate on the future of Australia's book market. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the conclusions contained in the PSA's final report in December that year was the welcome by the Authority of how this had broadened public understanding of the way in which the book market worked. Interestingly, the investigation by the Prices Surveillance Authority preceded a number of other calls for intervention into the prices of books in Australia, among them an investigation by the Trade Practices Commission in 1972, which rejected calls for the retail price maintenance of books. A quote from the Trade Practices Commission at that time is very pertinent to the legislation now being debated:</PARA>
<PARA>The most obvious form of competition is price competition, particularly in industries where quality or product is fairly uniform. Keen retail price competition promotes efficiencies, penalises the inefficient and generally means lower prices for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with this background that the Government has arrived at the Copyright Amendment Bill now before the House, which will see a fairer deal for consumers of books in Australia. That has been achieved with due regard for the domestic publishing industry, ensuring that it will not be severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> This provision is encompassed in proposed new section 44a (2), which gives effect to the Government's decision to enable a person to import a non-infringing book into Australia for commercial distribution where the book was not able to be supplied by the copyright owner for a period of at least 90 days. Stringent protection provisions exist and need to be adhered to before exclusion from copyright infringement can be granted. The person importing the book must have ordered in writing from the copyright owner or the copyright owner's agent or licensee one or more of the relevant versions of the book. I point out here the important distinction from the consumer's standpoint between a `version' and an `edition' of the same book, because if there are two different paperback editions of the same book, either would qualify as the paperback version of the book. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a condition that the copies ordered must not be second-hand or more in number than needed to satisfy the person's reasonable requirements. To prevent the illicit importation of books, at the time a person orders an imported copy of a book the written order to the copyright owner, agent or licensee must not have been withdrawn or cancelled by the person. Further along this track, the copyright owner, licensee or agent must not have filled the person's written order and there must also have been a lapse of at least 90 days since the person placed the order. </PARA>
<PARA> In order not to prevent free trade, once these conditions have been met it is proposed in the Bill that it not be considered to be an infringement of copyright to sell or otherwise commercially deal with the book in Australia. Given the outcries from the Australian publishing industry whenever the suggestion to relax the copyright regulations has been mooted in the past, it is only natural that the measures in this legislation aimed at giving the consumer a fairer go would receive some attention. It needs to be stressed that the Government has given due regard to the domestic publishing industry and the booksellers, as is again reflected in proposed new section 44a (5) of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This section proposes that an order will only be considered to be filled when the copyright owner, licensee or agent has sent to the person who placed the order the full number of copies ordered. This prevents anyone unscrupulously attempting to import books for phantom orders that would bring about unfair competition for the Australian publishers. It also ensures that booksellers' orders are fulfilled in total and on time. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the bigger protection picture, publishing is no different from any other industry: open the local market to a flood of overseas publications and in the short term consumers would pick up a few cheap buys, but in the long term Australian publishers would fold, causing great economic disruption to an industry which the Prices Surveillance Authority found to be worth more than $1 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a scenario would close the door to many lesser known Australian writers, which is an outcome totally unpalatable to honourable members on this side of the chamber. Over the years our literary talent has become known the world over and that is something that we, as Australians, are extremely proud of. It is not the Government's wish to have in place a system of copyright regulations which prevent the next Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, Colleen McCulloch or Thomas Keneally being given their first break. </PARA>
<PARA> Our literary history is very much a part of our heritage. I mention the name of Henry Lawson; he is particularly important for members on this side of the House, celebrating as we are the centenary of the Australian Labor Party and the great works Henry Lawson actually wrote for the labour movement in its early days. There is something unique about our writers which makes people from overseas stand up and say, `That is Australian', and makes them want to explore the other facets of this country. That in turn encourages people to come here and that certainly boosts some of our other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The plight that would confront lesser known Australian writers should the market be open too widely is perhaps best expressed in a letter published in the Australian Financial Review on 31 January 1990 by Ms Gail Cork, the Executive Officer of the Australian Society of Authors, who referred to comments made by more renowned authors on the issue of copyright. The letter reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Did it not occur to-</PARA>
<PARA>the journalist writing the story-</PARA>
<PARA>that they were name authors whom journalists hounded for comment throughout this debate? Of course their voices were heard above the rest-they are public figures. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the average author who has only achieved publication in Australia stood to lose far more than those with an international reputation and a heavyweight agent standing guard over their interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The loss of publishing opportunities in Australia, for one thing, would have dealt a severe blow to new and moderately successful Australian authors. </PARA>
<PARA>I say confidently that the outcome for lesser known Australian writers via the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill is one that gives them a far more secure future than they may have once feared. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the issue of Australia's international reputation as a credible and trustworthy nation, specifically in regard to our signature to the Berne Copyright Convention of 1886. This Convention commits each signatory country to providing copyright protection for works published in all other signatory countries. In the publishing area, as in other areas, Australia has a fine reputation in the international arena for its adherence to and tangible support for worldwide conventions. </PARA>
<PARA> Though it be far from the world of books, our involvement in the United Nations international task force in the Middle East is recent proof of our commitment to this end-an involvement which we are showing to the world that we are prepared to back up our signature with tangible support through Australia's involvement in the removal and destruction of chemical weapons facilities presently going on in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recognition in this Bill of the principles of the Berne Convention of 1886, while at the same time having due regard for the Australian publishing industry and our future writers, shows that the Government and its members on this side of the House have given proper consideration to Australia's present and future copyright requirements. This is clearly seen in the outcome which overcomes consumer access difficulties, makes for a sustainable future for the domestic publishing industry and creates an environment in which authors can devote all their resources to the thing they do best-that is, writing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the issue of copyright often involves a difficult balance between the rights of copyright owners who have invested time, money, originality and creativity in a particular piece of work and the right of the public to have access to their works in a reasonable time and at reasonable cost. It is a difficult task to achieve this balance in all cases, but I believe the Bill before us has done just that and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Copyright Amendment Bill 1990 provides for the partial deregulation of the importation provisions for books as set out in the Copyright Act 1968. This legislation has been a long time coming, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has already pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite overwhelming evidence that British publishers and their Australian subsidiaries were abusing the monopoly rights conferred on them under the existing Act of 1968, it was not until 1983 that the Commonwealth subjected these provisions of the Act to an examination by the Copyright Law Review Committee. That Committee, as we have already been told, reported in September 1988. But it was not until the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) handed down the final report of its inquiry into book prices in December 1989 that we saw moves towards this legislation which we are now finally debating. </PARA>
<PARA> After all this time, and after considerable public debate, this legislation is notable more for what it does not achieve than for any impact it might have on the market for books published overseas and sold in Australia. For a start, it fails to amend identical provisions relating to the importation of sound recordings which have seen Australians paying outrageous monopoly prices for compact discs, records and cassettes. This is despite the existence of an excellent and thoroughgoing examination of this question by the Prices Surveillance Authority in the report handed down last December. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ridiculous that we should amend the Act for one product when the same provisions are producing identical results with other copyright materials that have also been the subject of a detailed report by a government authority. It is a wasted legislative opportunity on the part of a government that rams legislation through the House, as it is doing tonight under the guillotine, on the pretext of limited sitting hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill are essentially the recommendations in the Copyright Law Review Committee's report of 1988. The Committee recommended that the importation of an overseas published book should be deregulated only in the case of the copyright owner failing to make that book available in Australia after a reasonable time. This Bill provides that the copyright owner will retain exclusive distribution rights over any books that are first published within Australia, as well as those that are first published overseas but then published in Australia within 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA> However, booksellers will be able to import directly books for commercial distribution where the Australian copyright owner cannot supply those titles within 90 days of a written order. Parallel imports can continue until such time as the copyright owner fulfils any outstanding orders. The principal effect of this Bill could be to make overseas published works available in this country much sooner than at present, and to that extent it is welcome. This will end the situation in which Australians have had to wait months for overseas titles to be released here, which has turned Australia into something of a literary backwater over recent years. It is clear, however, that this Bill will have only a marginal impact on book prices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright owners need only to ensure the timely distribution of books within Australia in order to retain their exclusive distribution rights under the territorial distribution of copyright which has been organised between British and United States publishers. United Kingdom (UK) publishers, when obtaining publishing rights, have it seems always insisted on agreements that give them exclusive rights to distribute in their traditional markets, and that includes Australia. UK publishers can then price discriminate between different countries because the ban on parallel imports prevents international arbitrage on the part of booksellers. </PARA>
<PARA> Because Australians are great lovers of books-we purchase more books per capita than people in any other country in the world-the demand for books in this country is relatively unresponsive to price. This allows British publishers to charge much higher prices for books in Australia than they do elsewhere without adversely affecting their total unit sales. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also evidence to suggest that British publishers engaged in formal collusion to set roughly equivalent prices for books which are close substitutes for one another, further restricting competition. With imported books constituting over half the retail value of the Australian market, the effects of these pricing arrangements in this country are, of course, considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> To cite evidence relevant to my own constituency, a study of book prices in Perth conducted by the Department of Library and Information Studies at Curtin University found an average 52 per cent mark-up on the overseas published prices-that is, over the overseas published prices-for the same works. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill therefore fails to alleviate what the Prices Surveillance Authority has accurately described as a tax on our cultural enrichment. As far as this legislation is concerned, the two PSA inquiries into book and sound recording prices might well not have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In adopting the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Government has ignored the important criticisms that were levelled at its report by the PSA and the overwhelming evidence that the PSA brought to bear on the subject. The Government appears to have caved in to the demands of Australian publishers and Australian authors for protection against foreign competition, to the detriment of Australian readers. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his second reading speech claimed that the influx of cheap overseas books produced for much bigger domestic markets would threaten economic loss to both Australian publishers and Australian authors if the PSA's recommendations were adopted. If this situation were to eventuate, it would be highly desirable from the standpoint of many consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of publishers, the economic loss referred to is the loss of monopoly profits that are gained at the expense of consumers. In the case of Australian authors, the Minister's anticipation of losses can only be considered as something of an insult to their literary talents. It implies that their work is of an inferior quality that needs to be protected by higher prices for imported books by foreign authors. Admittedly, Australian authors, to the extent that they are accurately represented by the Australian Society of Authors, share the Minister's sentiments. These writers apparently have no confidence in their ability to compete with overseas authors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Society of Authors has no qualms about depriving Australians of affordable access to the literature of the world, thus turning Australia into a culturally introspective and somewhat parochial literary backwater. The Minister claims that consumers would suffer from the decline in distinctively Australian literature in a fully deregulated import market. But what is the literature worth, if Australians have expressed a preference for imported books? And by what right does the Government establish itself as the guardian of our literary tastes? That literature should be viewed in such chauvinistic terms is entirely inappropriate. Literature should not be held hostage to national boundaries. Rather, it should foster a cosmopolitan and international appreciation of cultural life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is deeply ironic that intellectuals who so often set themselves up as opponents of the state and of property rights should run to the Government for protection for their publishers' exclusive rights when faced with potential competition from overseas writers and what they fear will prove to be a more highly sought after product by Australian readers. It is extremely ironic that our left wing intellectuals should suddenly become defenders of the monopoly profits of British publishers and their Australian subsidiaries. Such are the double standards of our taxpayer funded literary establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> One might be forgiven for suspecting that there is a hidden agenda to this Bill, with the Government seeking to buy off sections of the Australian intelligentsia for the purposes of the next election by saving them from the PSA's recommendations and greater competition. As the Sydney Morning Herald noted in an editorial of 6 January last year when the Bill was first mooted, `Plainly, Mr Bowen's compromise reform is designed to shut up the authors and publishers in the period before the election'. There is always another election around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA> With the music industry, where the Government has initiated Austrade funding assistance, it is continuing to protect monopoly distribution rights in sound recordings through the provisions of the Copyright Act. The support of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for the record industry is well known and, if press reports are to be believed, Senator Richardson has also been captured by the Australian Record Industry Association-a very powerful ally indeed. It is interesting to contrast that with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which argued strongly at the PSA inquiry for the abolition of the monopoly in sound recordings. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the protected and inflated profits of British publishers are used to help develop marginal, first time Australian authors. The element of risk inherent in publishing means that successful titles will inevitably end up subsidising less successful works. That is the way it goes. But nobody is asking publishers to publish books on anything other than a commercial basis. We have every reason to believe that the interest of publishers in Australian authors is based purely on the profits they expect to gain from publishing their work. The publishers have provided no evidence whatsoever that they willingly engage in the systematic cross-subsidisation of marginal Australian authors. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wishes to assist Australian authors, it should subsidise them directly through the Australia Council or similar bodies, rather than conferring monopoly profits on foreign publishers in the faint hope that some of those profits might benefit Australian literature. There are many industries which do not have access to monopoly profits that nevertheless invest in new and innovative products on the basis of anticipated future returns. This is an integral part of entrepreneurship and there is no reason why publishers, or the record industry, should be given special consideration. The Government should recognise the extent to which these monopoly profits, conferred on overseas publishers, have prevented the emergence of independent Australian publishers. Higher book prices have acted as a tax on the consumption of literature in Australia to the detriment of overall market size from which Australian authors derive a large part of their income. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern has been expressed at the possibility of overseas editions of works by Australian authors being remaindered and then dumped on the Australian market. This is something which would not be covered, as I understand it, by anti-dumping legislation, since it could not be said to result in material injury to a particular industry. Without getting into the debate about the merits or demerits of dumping, it is worth noting that this is a matter that could be easily addressed by contractual means, if Australian authors were not so beholden to their monopolistic publishers. Many of the problems faced by Australian authors are the result of their relationships with their publishers and have nothing to do with the importation provisions attached to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As the PSA argued in its final report, it would be inappropriate to try to solve the problem by perpetuating a system which serves mainly to boost publishers' profits. Rather, the solution must lie in the contractual relationship of authors and publishers. It also needs to be said that most Australian authors do not have an international readership. Most Australian writing is for the Australian market, for which foreign-authored books are not close substitutes. The views of the Australian Society of Authors, therefore, do not reflect the interests of most Australian writers. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill, which provide for the more ready availability of overseas published works, will also result in major losses of consumer benefits through greater administrative costs. Potential importers will have to establish the lack of availability of each title by having placed a written order with the Australian copyright owner who is allowed 90 days to fill the order. If the copyright owner fails to fill the order, the importer will then face further costs, given that orders for imports will also have to be placed in writing with another publisher before being granted exception from copyright infringement. After all this effort, the copyright owner may then re-establish monopoly rights, simply by supplying the market at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that, under the existing law, books and sound recordings can be freely imported by individuals for non-commercial purposes and that this Bill further provides that book sellers can do this in response to requests from individual customers. Many people purchase their books and records directly from overseas because, even with exchange rate differences and shipping costs, it is cheaper and quicker to import direct from an overseas supplier than to pay monopoly prices in Australia. One United States supplier, BookCall, operates a fax service 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can fill Australian orders within a week. In the case of compact discs, their small size and light weight means that they can be posted extremely cheaply, enabling Australian consumers to enjoy the far cheaper prices available from record stores overseas. All this entails some very unwelcome consequences for our balance of payments, as Australian consumers increasingly discover that they do not have to contribute to the monopoly profits of overseas publishers and record companies simply by buying overseas instead of in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred to developments in the copyright law of other countries in justifying the inadequacies of the Bill as it appears at the moment. If other countries wish to restrict the access of their customers to the cultural products of the world, that is a lamentable development, but not something which Australia should emulate. What the Minister seems to ignore, in the case of the United Kingdom, for example, is that being a net exporter of books puts the UK in a completely different position to that of Australia, which is a net importer of books and, therefore, stands to suffer considerably at the hands of restrictive importation practices in copyright laws, whereas the UK stands to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is yet another example of failed micro-economic reform, as the honourable member for Kooyong has already said. I will quote from the PSA report into the prices of sound recordings:</PARA>
<PARA>Restrictions on parallel imports are most unusual and extreme, by the standards of modern international trade policy around the world, and they almost totally insulate the industry from the effects of macroeconomic policy, and place a greater burden on the rest of Australian industry which consequently has to face a larger burden of adjustment than otherwise. The industry's prices are therefore in need of change as part of the agenda of microeconomic reform in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I wholeheartedly support the honourable member for Kooyong in the amendment he has moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) indicated, the Copyright Amendment Bill is in a sense a compromise between the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) report and the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) report. As has been pointed out, it is not easy to balance all of the interests, because there are the interests of Australian writers, Australian publishers and, of course, Australian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly I will deal with some of the matters that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised. He said that the Copyright Amendment Bill caved in to the interests of Australian writers and publishers, to the detriment of Australian readers. I think it is worth coming back to the intention of the Bill, which is to make both hardback and paperback books available to Australian consumers more quickly and at cheaper prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The means to bring that about will be the improved availability which will result from three main changes in this area. Copyright owners' existing control over commercial importation of copies of their works will be lost. Anyone will be able to import books of their works for sale in Australia: firstly, unless new overseas titles are published simultaneously, that is, within 30 days in Australia, as provided for in proposed new sections 44a (1) and 112a (1); secondly, if copies of any title are unavailable from the copyright owner for more than 90 days, as provided for in proposed new sections 44a (2) and 112a (2); and, thirdly, to satisfy customers' orders for single copies of books at any time, as provided for in proposed new sections 44a (3) and 112a (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Cheaper prices should result from allowing anyone to import paperback versions of a book available in Australia only in hardback if the copyright owners will not supply paperbacks for more than 90 days. The points raised by the honourable member for Curtin-whilst I note what he has to say-are incorrect. The Bill goes a good deal further than the honourable member for Curtin has acknowledged. It certainly goes further than the Copyright Law Review Committee recommendations and it adopts the PSA report in part. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I move to one crucial example-that is, the loss of import control if a new overseas title is not published in Australia within 30 days. That exceeds the Copyright Law Review Committee's recommendations and leans in the direction of the PSA. I think that was also implicitly acknowledged in the contribution by the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been an extremely difficult Bill. As the honourable member for Kooyong pointed out, the Government decision, subject to amendments to be moved tonight, was announced in December 1989 and all of the amendments which have been foreshadowed have arisen from discussions with booksellers, publishers, authors and other interested parties. The Bill came in in 1990, eight months ago, and there has been considerable discussion throughout that period with all interested parties, including the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, and his office. I think that led, to some extent, to the fact that whilst there are amendments to be moved by the Opposition-and, in addition to the amendments to be moved in committee which have been foreshadowed, there was also the second reading amendment-at the end of the day, the Opposition is saying that this is a big improvement on where we have been. I think, to the extent of that limited bipartisanship, that is a good thing and something which we probably do not see enough of. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading amendment the honourable member for Kooyong seems to be asking for basically two things. Firstly, he calls for Australia to promote a uniform regime in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and, secondly, he seeks clarification or amendment of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC). In relation to both of those matters, we are already moving very strongly on the question of a uniform regime in the GATT, and I can assure the honourable member for Kooyong that that activity started at the beginning of the current GATT Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> I further assure him that if he did not have an ambition-and I sometimes wonder why anyone would have it- to become Attorney-General, he may find the delights of arguing intellectual property in the Green Room in Geneva something which would cure his interest in this matter fairly quickly. I think that it is not correct to be moving an amendment that we pursue the international negotiations by contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, because that is being done. It is being done vigorously and, in fact, it has been done throughout the whole of this round of the Uruguay negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> This country also has been extremely active both in Berne and UCC meetings, and we will be attending meetings of Berne exports on a possible protocol to the Berne convention. Whilst I understand what the Opposition is saying in the second reading amendment, I think both of those matters are being more than adequately dealt with by the present Government, irrespective of what the views of those opposite may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong spent some time also on the fact that there is going to be a very limited amount of time for debate this evening, particularly at the committee stage. I understand his concern about that. In order to assist with his agreement in respect of the way we conduct this debate this evening, at this stage, in closing the second reading debate, I propose to touch on the amendments which have been circulated in my name. I seek leave to have the proposed amendments incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members will be aware, this Bill has been the subject of very close examination, as I indicated earlier, by the Government and interested parties and, as I also said, by the shadow Attorney-General and his staff. These amendments that the Government has circulated tonight are the result of that detailed examination. I believe that the amendments to be moved-there are 13 amendments, as the honourable member for Kooyong pointed out-will greatly enhance the operation of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendment No.1 confines the countries from which books may be imported to member countries of international conventions to which Australia is a party and other countries which enforce Australian copyright under section 184 of the Act. This amendment is at slight variance with the original Government decision because that decision referred only to overseas countries that were members of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. We believe that it is necessary to include member countries of other copyright conventions to which Australia is a party, namely, the Universal Copyright Convention and our recently concluded bilateral agreement with Singapore. This amendment also leaves open the possibility of adding further countries from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment also prevents the importation of books made under a compulsory licence in another country so that such books will not be able to be imported into Australia without the permission of the copyright owner. This is proposed as a consequence of a concern that compulsory licences are available to developing countries under the Berne Convention and permit them in certain circumstances to make copies of works of foreign copyright owners without their permission but forbid exportation of books so made to other countries. This proposed amendment will ensure that importation into Australia of such copies is prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the time available, various amendments are linked-amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 8, 11 and 12. These proposed amendments are largely consequential upon other amendments and do not involve any change in policy. The introduction of the new defined expression `overseas works' in amendment No. 2 and `overseas edition' in amendment No. 8 are an improvement in the direction of plain English. Amendments Nos 5 and 11 are consequential upon the introduction of those expressions. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to amendments Nos 3 and 9. These amendments will substitute a re-worded section 44a (2) and section 112a (2) respectively in the Bill. The re-wording is consequential upon the substitution of the new expression `overseas work and overseas edition' and are the subject of the new definition introduced by amendments Nos 7 and 13. More importantly, section 44a (2) (d) (i) and its mirror provision for published editions, section 112a (2) (d) (i), are new provisions which have been inserted as a result of what we found to be a convincing submission by the Australian Book Publishers Association (ABPA), the Australian Copyright Council and the Australian Society of Authors. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present Bill a bookseller must wait 90 days before importing backless books. It is now proposed that, if a publisher or his or her agent cannot confirm ability to supply within seven days of receipt of the order, a bookseller may proceed to import from elsewhere without having to wait the 90 days. I believe that if a publisher is, in fact, able to advise that it cannot supply the market with a certain book then a bookseller should be able to import from elsewhere without having to wait 90 days. In my view, this would work to the advantage of both the industry and consumers as booksellers would be more certain about when they would be able to import and books would become available in Australia more readily. As this change has the support of the publishers, I do not envisage that there would be any opposition to it. I am inclined to think that that may not have been something which was picked up by the honourable member for Curtin before his contribution this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The final set of amendments are amendments Nos 4 and 10, and 7 and 13. Amendments Nos 4 and 10 will prevent the importation of copies of a hardback version of a book where the copyright owner, although unable to fill an order for copies of that version of the book or published edition, can supply copies of the paperback version. The possibility of dumping-another matter referred to by the honourable member for Curtin-of remaindered hardbacks was viewed by the ABPA to operate against the protection of paperbacks by Australian authors. Whilst the original Government decision referred to treating hardback and paperback versions of books as separate articles, I must say that I have been completely persuaded by the ABPA that the Bill as drafted would work against the interests of Australian authors when hardback versions of their work could be imported at a lower price than the local paperback. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, amendments Nos 7 and 13 clarify, by the new definition of `overseas work' and `overseas edition', that the right to import copies of new titles published overseas does not arise until the expiration of 30 days from the first publication overseas or at all if the title is published in Australia within that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to take any further time summing up this debate because of the fact that, as the honourable member for Kooyong has indicated, there are difficulties with time in respect of the amendments to be moved in the committee stage. I thank those who have contributed to the debate, particularly from our side the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and those from the Opposition. Whilst I understand what the honourable member for Curtin was on about, I hope that I have answered to his satisfaction some of his concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has implied-and as I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage-there are a significant number of amendments that I wish to move, over and above the amendments, 13 in all, that the Government is moving. I foreshadowed that in the second reading debate. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 1, after clause 1 insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA> ``1a. This Act commences 3 months after the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to proposed new clause 1a. The Bill is silent as to the commencement date. By the provision of the Acts Interpretation Act the Bill is to commence 28 days after the day on which it receives the royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment seeks to extend the commencement date so that it is three months after the date of royal assent. Even though I criticised the Government for being so slow in this arena, and I think there is justification for that, the 13 amendments produced by the Government make very significant changes to the Bill circulated to the industry. In many respects this Bill is therefore very different. I think we should give the industry some time to adjust to it. In seeking to extend the commencement date so that it is three days after the date of assent, the amendment will allow for authors, publishers, distributors and booksellers to make appropriate industry adjustments in the light of changes to be brought about by the Bill, particularly in light of the substantial amendments to be moved by the Government which have not yet been made public. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2(b) refers to regulations prescribing countries from which books may be imported and, additionally, regulations to be made for the purposes of new part IVa, to prescribe the relevant `reasonable time' for different copyright articles. In the circumstances, we should not allow the writ of the Acts Interpretation Act simply to run for the 28 days. I seek to have the commencement date extended so that it is three months after the date of royal assent. </PARA>

<PARA> (5) Clause 5, page 3, line 31, after paragraph (c) insert the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a book, the primary purpose of the publication of which is for use by students of an educational institution as a book required for a course of study at that institution;''. </PARA>
<PARA>I formally move my amendment 5, and I foreshadow in these remarks that I will be moving amendment 8, which relates thereto, because a similar change that I am proposing in amendment 5 relates to subsection 112a (7) by amendment 8. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment seeks to introduce an exemption for textbooks from the operation of the Bill. A new paragraph (d) is added to subsection 44a (7) to provide that a book does not include `a book, the primary purpose of the publication of which is for use by students of an educational institute as a book required for a course of study at that institution'. It is worth at least noting that the `primary purpose' test is one which is found in a number of Commonwealth and State statutes. A similar phrase `substantial purpose' has also been considered by the courts on a number of occasions in the trade practices area. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Attorney is going to again reject this amendment, I would just ask him to pause for a moment and open his mind on this issue. I have had a very good look at a number of textbooks that are produced internationally and that students desperately need in this country, and they require adaptation to Australian standards. The textbook exemption will be subject to a two-year sunset clause. The reasons behind it are twofold: firstly, the Prices Surveillance Authority found the concerns regarding availability and cost which had preoccupied it and concerned it so much were not that great regarding tertiary textbooks and, secondly, substantial resources are put in for Australian adaptation of international textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA> I picked up one international textbook and compared it with the Australian text that has been adapted. An extraordinary amount of work is done. For example, if we are dealing with marketing in the United States, and we give many case examples of what transpires in marketing of a particular product on the west coast and east coast of the United States, in Cleveland or Ohio or various States, we find that these authors have to go through the difficult, expensive and time-consuming process of adapting that all for Australian conditions, so that when the student is reading he is reading not about the west and east coasts of America but about various regional differences in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which companies market in those different areas and the techniques that have been successful-and the companies that have done this are all Australian companies-are really quite impressive. One can pick up the most authoritative text on a given subject that is produced in America and, if one desperately wants one's students to have that so that they can more readily understand its relevance in Australia, one can have it rewritten with tested case studies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I really would urge upon the Attorney, even if he is rejecting this amendment tonight, that as the legislation wends its way to another place, he have a look at this because it would be in the interests of a significant body of students and it might at last lend some substantiation to his Leader's desire for Australia to become a clever country. </PARA>

<PARA> This amendment does exclude educational books and, if one looks at the history of this matter, one finds that one of the main sources of complaint has been the cost of books for education and the delays in getting them. There have been particular concerns expressed by American publishers that appear-it may not be the case-to be reflected in this amendment. In fact, as the situation is now, the books will be in competition with foreign books and, as far as the examination of the history of this matter and the matters that have been put before me are concerned, I do not see that there is any justification for this amendment at all. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment 9 seeks to introduce a new part IVa into the Act. The purpose of the new part IVa is to extend the operation of the Bill to other copyright articles in line with the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) in September 1988 which dealt with all copyright articles and of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) in December 1990 dealing with records. In terms of what I have said in arguing the case for opening up restrictive markets, which was so endorsed by the Prices Surveillance Authority whilst this Bill, as drafted, deals only with books, I seek by this amendment to extend it into other copyright areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it is not premature, because if the Attorney-General had read, as I have, every word of the Copyright Law Review Committee report and the Prices Surveillance Authority report, particularly the latter one dealing with records, he would know how substantial the case is for this. All of the arguments that my colleague, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and I, more succinctly, produced in the time available during the second reading debate in regard to the constraints within the marketplace on books apply equally elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, new part IVa is modelled on the private member's Bill that was introduced into this House by the then honourable member for Menzies in August of 1989. It is worth noting that the interface between new part IVa and the provisions of the Government's Bill dealing with books, as set in proposed section 113, involves the following: firstly, the exemptions set out in the Government's Bill-that is, subsections 44a (7) and 112a (7), with the addition of the textbook exemption that I was seeking before, remain exempted under the provisions of new part IVa. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in addition a further exemption is provided for in relation to computer software, computer programs and manuals used in connection with such programs. This is done in light of the pending inquiry on computer software by the Copyright Law Review Committee, which includes a reference to examine the operation of the importation provisions, vis-a-vis computer software. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar exemption also appears in the Government's definition of what is not a book-that is, subsections 44a (7) and 112a (7). Thirdly, all of these exemptions are subject to a two-year sunset clause. If the sunset clause takes effect, these exempted articles may be imported under the provisions of new part IVa. That is, of course, in regard to amendment 9. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment 10 flows from the introduction of new part IVa. The amendment seeks to amend the provisions of section 132 of the Act which deals with criminal offences for unlawful importation-that is, where the importation would constitute a breach of copyright. In essence, the amendment provides that if a procedure of the type set out in part IVa is properly followed, no criminal liability will arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I again urge the Attorney to examine the merits of this proposal. The point of my complaint is that a very technical examination of suggestions that have been put forward has to be made during a short committee stage debate. The arguments on textbooks were compelling, yet they were rejected out of hand. However, I think the arguments for the introduction of a new part IVa into the Act commend themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude on the note that I began: we have a situation where the strength of argument contained in the reports of the CLRC and the PSA to which I have referred ought to be picked up by what has been proffered on behalf of the Opposition in respect of amendments 9 and 10. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to Opposition amendments 9 and 10. We have already been reminded by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) that the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) was given a reference to inquire into the prices of records after it had finished its book prices report. It presented the report on record prices last December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since that time, as has been the case with the Bill before us tonight, we have had an enormous number of representations and submissions in relation to this matter. As the shadow Attorney will understand, this matter involves areas other than the Attorney-General's Department. It particularly involves industry areas. An interdepartmental committee (IDC) has been examining the PSA's recommendations in light of comments that it sought from interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it can be conceded that there are similarities between the arguments in the record prices debate and the books debate. However, I think the shadow Attorney would agree that there are very important and significant differences. Let me mention some of them. One is the existence of two copyrights in respect of sound recordings-music and the recording. There is the position of performers who are not also composers of what they perform. There is the question of the uniformity of format of records and tapes and the consequences that that has for pricing. These and other characteristics of records are not found in the book scene. More broadly, the whole industry arrangements built on the exploitation of sound recordings are different to those governing books. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite having spent a substantial period preparing its report on book prices, the PSA found it necessary to spend a comparable amount of time and effort on the record prices report. I would put to the shadow Attorney that people have the right to expect that any government would study the records report with the benefit of advice from the IDC in light of comments which have been sought from interested parties before making a decision on the PSA's recommendation on records. </PARA>
<PARA> It would hardly do justice to the matter by accepting this Opposition amendment. The Government will be giving consideration very shortly to the records recommendations. But in the meantime, I would suggest to the Opposition that we focus on books. That is the sole concern of this Bill. I do not think we ought to move into the area of records in relation to this Bill. For those reasons, the suggested amendment is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> As I also said earlier in respect of Opposition amendment No. 10, I again refer the shadow Attorney to section 132(1) (d) because amendment No. 10 seems to me to do no more than double up on existing section 132(1) (d), and the amendments are not acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA> But, more to the point, I want to mention the interdepartmental committee (IDC) on which the Attorney-General hangs his hat for rejecting my amendment in saying, `Look, it's just gone off to the IDC'. The Attorney-General has forgotten that, in saying I was premature in moving this, the Government in fact set up an interdepartmental committee to consider the Prices Surveillance Authority report. That was to conclude by March 1991. To the best of my knowledge and belief, today is Tuesday, 14 May 1991, so the Attorney-General has had that report, if it met the guidelines he set down, for some two months. If it did not meet the guidelines he set down, he ought to put a rocket up the IDC, because it has been getting away with murder for decades-even from time to time when I was a Minister. I rise on this occasion really to use this opportunity in debate on the title to answer what the Attorney-General has just said. Those amendments should have been accepted, because he should have had the report by March.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just prior to Christmas last, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) announced that the Federal Government was going to allocate another $23m for a major overseas advertising campaign by the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC). He announced at that time that this was going to be paid for by an increase in the rate of departure tax from Australia from $10 to $20. This move is going to raise that $23m for the ATC campaign but, in its first full year of operation, it will raise some $35m and, in subsequent years, some $37m. I wonder whether the Government can inform me whether this is now going to be its principal form of funding the Australian Tourist Commission-whether we are going to have a user pays principle. At last, if we do that, we might see some genuine funding of the promotion of tourism overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that the move by the Government to spend the additional $23m, principally on a television campaign, has been welcomed by this side of the Parliament. There is no doubt that the momentum that had been gained in the tourist industry in recent years has suffered. It has suffered because of the most stupid industrial dispute that Australia has ever seen-the airline dispute of 1989 and 1990; it has been affected by bad weather; it has been affected by the Gulf war; and it has been affected by the downturn in the economy of some of our major partners in the tourism business. </PARA>
<PARA> The concentration of the Australian Tourist Commission program in this campaign has been in the major markets of Japan and the United States; it is also being used to open up a brand new market for Australian tourism, the market of Korea. Over the next decade Korea promises to be one of Australia's principal international markets for inbound tourists. One can only hope that it will not be too long before we see an increase in the number of airline services out of Korea. At the moment we have two a week, and Qantas Airways Ltd has continually put back the operation of its particular services. It is my belief that, over the next five to 10 years, Korea is going to develop as one of the most important markets for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that we make sure that we consolidate our position as far as Japan is concerned. Looking at the figures, Japan is seen to be the biggest provider of short term visitors to Australia. It is quite interesting to analyse the nature of tourism into Australia in the last 12 months, because the four major countries are now providing 64 per cent of the total short term visitor arrivals in Australia. Those four countries are Japan, New Zealand, the United States and, interestingly, the United Kingdom, which has expanded quite quickly. The rest of the world provides just 36 per cent of Australia's short term visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we should not ignore those particular markets because within them there is the potential to provide a great number of tourists. I refer particularly to areas such as South Africa. The indication is at the moment that the Government is likely to reopen the air routes between Australia and South Africa. The other interesting market that comes through on the visitor arrival figures is the Scandinavian market. As one who for many years now has been standing in this place promoting the virtues of Scandinavian tourism to Australia, it is interesting to see that that is emerging as one of the principal markets out of Europe, along with Switzerland. It is also interesting at this stage that the Government has not negotiated any sort of air services arrangements with the Scandinavian countries, and perhaps some concentration could be put on that in relation to air service arrangements and future promotional programs by the Australian Tourism Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still, at all levels of government in Australia, and indeed in this House, a failure to recognise just what the tourism industry is all about in Australia. The tourist industry now ranks as Australia's largest earner of export income. In 1989-90, the tourist industry generated $6.5 billion in foreign exchange, contributed 5.4 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product, accounted for 9 per cent of our export dollars, and employed 500,000 Australians-5.9 per cent of the work force. It is the single largest private sector employer. The industry is credited with producing a total of $22.5 billion in tourism expenditure in 1989, $16.5 billion of it in domestic tourism. It is estimated that total indirect taxes derived from the industry in 1988-89 were approximately $2.7 billion, and that a substantial $21.2 billion of new tourist projects were firmly committed or under construction as of March of last year. They are very telling figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a little earlier that I hoped the marrying in of the departure tax, contributed by not only Australians going overseas but also all international visitors passing through our gateway ports, may be part of a new direction which is being taken as a means of funding tourism promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that, while the amount of money that has been expended on promoting tourism has increased in recent years, it is still a very small section of the total contribution generated by tourism to the Australian economy. When one realises that $2.7 billion in tax has been got by this Government out of the tourist industry, the $40m or thereabouts that is usually expended on tourism is a very small percentage indeed compared with some of the assistance that other industries get. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one who is going to stand up here and ask the Government to pour dollars into support of the tourist industry, because I do not think it really needs it. I think the tourist industry would be quite happy to stand on its own two feet ultimately but, if there is a mechanism whereby this user pays principle can be evoked, then we are part of the way towards seeing tourism promotion get under way as it should. </PARA>
<PARA> I will raise a couple of points, because this Bill is not very contentious. One of the things that has concerned me during the 13 years of the operation of the departure tax is the method of collection. I am sure that honourable members who have travelled overseas have lined up at the cages which have been established at the various airport terminals to pay their $10 or $20 departure tax. They would have been subjected to queues; they may even have been embarrassed when they found that they did not have enough money to pay for their departure tax. They probably have been absolutely amazed, if they did not have any money, when they proffered their plastic in the years gone by, because the collectors would not take credit cards. They were probably even more amazed when they found they could sign an IOU. </PARA>
<PARA> A little Japanese person who is leaving Australia after a good holiday, hopefully having spent $4,000 or $5,000 while he was here, lines up at the cage and is subjected to these uniformed people telling him to sign an IOU. If he understands that, it is all right. But a little further down the track he starts getting all those dirty notes from the Australian Government saying, `You have not paid this particular money'. It is a crazy set-up, a stupid set-up. There must be some way that we can make sure that the departure tax becomes a component of the airline ticket, as it is in so many other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We are doing it in a domestic sense. People travelling through Cairns Airport or through Hamilton Island Airport do not know that they are paying a passenger handling charge, but next time honourable members get a ticket to those destinations, they should look at the little box on the coupon which says `taxes'. They will see that when they pass through Cairns some dollars are expended there as a passenger handling charge. Honourable members might be absolutely amazed at what they pay when they go through Hamilton Island as part of the ticket price. But that expense is combined as part of the ticket and part of the fare and, quite frankly, most people do not realise they are paying it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have argued that maybe the increase in the departure tax from $10 to $20 is far too great. In actual fact, our departure tax rates compare fairly favourably with those in most of the areas in our immediate sphere of influence. Most of the departure taxes are somewhere between $10 to $20 in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. But honourable members should look at the charges that are applied in terms of departure taxes and various other taxes in the United States. I think I am right in saying that an airline ticket in the United States has five taxes written into it. When a passenger buys that ticket, he has no idea that he is paying the taxes. The coupon is ripped off and off he flies, happy as Larry. But at the end of the day, taxes are distributed to various government agencies and various airports in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the highest passenger handling fees in the world are in the United Kingdom. I think, on last count, the total charges at Heathrow were in excess of $80. But that is not shown on the ticket. People do not line up at a little cage where someone in a brown uniform is demanding that they hand over this money before they go. There have been tremendous arguments over the years as to why somebody cannot collect this tax in a more subtle way than has been done in the past. I know that the airlines will kick and scream all the way, saying that it is not their job and they will not do it, but there are other methods we could look at. </PARA>
<PARA> While we could substitute a post office or a travel agent for the cage at the airport, that does not overcome the problem. There are a couple of clearing houses we could look at; for instance, the International Association of Travel Agents set-up or the system that is used by the airlines at the moment, the BSP, which is the bank settlement plan. I think it would be worth investigating the cost of having the BSP applied to departure taxes in Australia. Sure, we would be paying some commissions. It is now some years since I investigated the cost of collecting departure tax, but on the last count it was costing the Commonwealth something like $880,000 a year, so there could well be some argument for looking at one of those settlement plans as a means of collecting the departure tax without subjecting international visitors to Australia to the embarrassment and, in many cases, the annoyance of having to part with those last few dollars as they leave the country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great things about airports is their capacity to generate money from people prior to their leaving Australia. If one looks at some of the business done in duty free shops and other concessions around Australian airports, one sees that it is a wonderful way of ridding people of their last few dollars. Some time ago now some surveys were done of the attitudes of people leaving Australia. Some in that survey came out quite clearly as saying that the fact they had to part with $10 or $20 before they left turned them off spending that money-probably on Australian goods-in the airport concessions. We all know that those airport concessions contribute very greatly indeed to the cost of running an airport. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is at the table, may I say that I have been quite pleased to see that there is a more commercial attitude starting to creep into the Federal Airports Corporation. While I have no doubt that there is going to be some controversy in terms of Sydney, the advent of poker machines on the air side of the departure area of the Sydney international airport is one of many ways by which we can contribute more and more to the cost of running airports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very liberal, and very generous of me, too. One of these days I will tell the Minister about our plans for future airport development which will probably make his hair stand on end. The plain facts are that airports are a tremendous source of income. If they are developed commercially and well, the contribution they can make to the tremendous costs that are involved at airports should mean that at the end of the day we have cheaper costs to visitors coming in and going out of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition would join the Government in expressing its thanks to Greg Norman, who is going to head the television campaign in promoting Australia for the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) in the overseas television commercials that are being financed by this exercise tonight. There is no doubt that the previous campaign that we had with Paul Hogan was a great contributor to the flow of inbound visitors to Australia. We trust that Greg Norman might lead the golf-led recovery of Australian tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that we do have the right funding and right attitude by the ATC at the moment, because we need international tourism more and more. The plain facts are that, while domestic tourism in Australia provided about 80 per cent of the business at the time of the economic downturn, at the present time the domestic industry is in real trouble. If one looks at the major tourist destinations around Australia, such as Cairns or the Gold Coast, the top of the market properties, one sees that the five star properties are doing very well, but it is all due to international visitors. At the bottom end of the market, the backpackers are starting to come in in their numbers as well; that is not a problem. But it is the mums' and dads' properties in the middle, the two, three and four star properties, that are absolutely empty at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> For economies such as Cairns, parts of Western Australia and parts of New South Wales, the capacity to fill up some of those properties and get some of the expenditure up in terms of international visitors will really help take some of the pressure off those communities. Really, our share of the world tourism market is quite minuscule. We get only about 2 per cent of the North American market. At the moment we are getting only about 4 per cent of Japanese travellers. When one considers that every year some 17 million Americans travel overseas and that 10 million Japanese will travel overseas this year, our percentage of the business is very small. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope that the contribution made to the promotion of Australia as an international destination by this increase in the departure tax will see those numbers increase quite dramatically. Quite frankly, if we could double the numbers coming from those two countries, that would go a long way towards reducing some of our balance of payment problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is quite right: this country must realise that whether we like it or not, about 60 per cent of our international tourism traffic over the next decade will come out of Asia. At the moment a great deal of importance is being put on the negotiation of air rights to make sure we get that issue right. The only thing that worries me about putting all our eggs in one basket and concentrating entirely on Japan is that the Japanese market can be fickle and can change fairly dramatically. My friend the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) expressed concern about law and order problems on the Gold Coast. They are not terribly serious at the moment, but the word is getting around Japan. If things became serious and that market went away, we could have some problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at the full Asian spread and somehow we have to get back into the North American market. In recent times we have seen a fairly dramatic decline in the number of American visitors coming in. While the capacity on the United States (US) route has been opened up fairly well, and we have some more carriers and services coming on-line, we have to start filling those services. It concerns me that immediately after the Gulf war, when carriers like American Airlines and Continental Airlines were going into the US market and offering some amazing deals-for example, $900 for the round trip between Los Angeles and Sydney-that market did not take off to the extent it should have. I think that the reason for that was that some European operators were probably a little smarter than we were and had their promotional campaigns in place before we had the chance to get these commercials on air. Hopefully with a good campaign in North America, we will start to get some of that market back. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we will see a dramatic increase in the number of international visitors coming to Australia during the next decade. I know the Government has the objective of doubling the number of international visitors coming here. I would like to think we might have the capacity to double that figure again by the year 2000. I think the Government is looking to double the existing number by 1995. If we could double that again by the year 2000, we would be looking at 10 million international visitors coming here. Frankly, we have the stock and plant to be able to handle that number, but much of it will depend on the air rights and on making sure that we have that web of international air arrangements in place to be able to handle those visitors. Again, the fact is that the Asian market will be very important, because some 60 per cent of our business is there, but we must never forget we have a potential giant sitting on our doorstep in terms of what might happen in Europe when we start spending promotional money there and looking at opening up some of those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Minister will look at trying to get some air services agreements in place in eastern Europe. It will be some years before those markets come on-line. When talking to some of the carriers-particularly the Germans-it would be my guess that the East German market will probably be on-line in about five years, although some carriers are saying they will see the movement coming in two years. If we look at areas like Poland, Germany as it is now, Czechoslovakia in particular and even the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, we see that there is tremendous potential to start building those markets up, providing we have the infrastructure in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I know this debate is on a time limit tonight and I close my remarks by saying that the Opposition welcomes this increase and the fact that this money is being poured virtually directly into the promotion of Australia overseas as a major international destination. We have to make sure in these times of economic hardship that we get international visitors coming here because, as I said in my opening remarks, tourism is one of the few industries Australia has going for it. It is a huge earner of foreign exchange and it is our biggest private sector employer, now employing over 500,000 people. We must never forget figures from the Bureau of Industry Economics, proven time and time again, that every time we have a net increase of 25,000 international visitors coming to Australia, another 1,400 jobs are created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure to participate in this debate tonight on what I consider to be, as indicated by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), a wide-ranging debate on the issues of tourism and a number of associated matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specifically, the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1991 has as its aim the provision that the rate of departure tax be increased from $10 to $20 with effect from 1 August 1991. That decision follows the announcement made by the Government in December last year that the increase, by some $23m-although I accept the figures tendered by the honourable member for Fadden tonight-will be used as funding for the promotion of Australia as a tourist destination. Of course this promotion will enable Australia to capitalise on recent growth in tourism. It is estimated that some 8,700 jobs are created for every 10 per cent increase in arrivals of international visitors, and Australia's departure tax will remain on a par with similar taxes collected in a number of other countries. The honourable member for Fadden went through that in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased that the majority of this funding is to go to a promotion campaign by the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC), which will employ Greg Norman in a very large role to promote Australia as a tourist destination. Indeed, that follows a successful campaign which involved Paul Hogan. I well remember what happened when the advertisements featuring Paul Hogan went to air in the United States. Within a matter of days the switchboards at Qantas's offices in that country were absolutely jammed with calls from people wanting to get more information and come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the response rate was so incredibly high that Qantas had not been prepared for it. Qantas thought the advertisements were reasonable, talking as they did about throwing another shrimp on the barbie and so on, but it did not realise the extent to which a market such as the United States was ripe and ready for Australian in-bound tourism to pick up. I think the Australian Tourist Commission suddenly realised that it had to plough further resources into the area. I remember that when the Hogan commercials were due to go to air in Japan, ATC determined it would not run them because of the enormous rush of Japanese people wanting to get further information about Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that promotion utilising Australian national identities such as Paul Hogan and Greg Norman are masterstrokes on behalf of the Australian Tourist Commission and the Government. I well remember that it was the former Minister for tourism, the Hon. John Brown, who spoke to Paul Hogan and was instrumental in his appearing in many of those commercials on behalf of the Australian Tourist Commission. Those commercials, as we have already acknowledged tonight, proved to be very successful. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in relation to tourism in Australia I am concerned about the question of infrastructure, to which the honourable member for Fadden referred, and the general question of economic benefit to this country, because the various levels of government do not seem to have a coordinated policy. It disturbs me to see a series of articles written recently-in fact, this month-in newspapers such as the Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald and so on, with headlines such as, `It's time for all politicians to recognise tourism's huge value', `Australia: it now rides on the overseas visitor's back', `Industry's place in economy still not acknowledged', `Call for plan to cope with tourist influx', and so on. All those articles, and subsequent ones, talked about reports presented by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, subsequent reports to the CEDA meeting by the Hon. John Brown in his capacity as chairman of the Tourism Task Force, and, indeed, about the industry itself trying to get into people's minds the significance of tourism to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fadden quoted all the figures to us tonight. He is absolutely correct. It is the No. 1 income earner for this country. In fact, many of the figures being talked about here illustrate that extremely well. One report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates suggest that each 10 per cent real increase in earnings from inbound tourism leads to a $180 million increase in Gross Domestic Product and an extra $310 million in foreign exchange earnings from travel credits, costs $120 million in extra imports and gives a net contribution to the current account of $190 million. </PARA>
<PARA>An industry which can do that has to be taken seriously. I think there is this need to take it seriously. But as was suggested in the CEDA report which was tabled and which was in fact released by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) earlier this month, there is clearly a call for greater cooperation and coordination. The report was critical of the support given to tourism, as I have indicated, by all levels of government, saying that fragmented policies suggested that governments were making only a token commitment to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we have seen that that `token' commitment, at least by this Federal Government, is more than that. The Government has injected at least $23m in prospect, perhaps $35m in real terms, into a promotion campaign such as this, into the Australian Tourist Commission. It is tangible evidence again of this Government's commitment to tourism and to the promotion of tourism. Again I go back to that original report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Conflicting federal, state and local government policies were resulting in duplicated efforts, inefficiencies and inconsistencies in tourism planning, management and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also says that the country's fastest growing industry is a major catalyst for economic growth and structural change. We all agree with that, but there is obviously a need for that coordinated approach. I think it is something which people in the Australia Tourist Commission-whether it be in John Brown's Tourism Task Force or in levels of government-need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 18 months ago or so the Prime Minister established within the Illawarra region the Illawarra Regional Consultative Council, which drew on people from a variety of areas to put together a regional development strategy for the Illawarra region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something which I have raised in this Parliament previously in two committees of inquiry which I chaired into the funding and administration of sport in this country. But still nothing has been done about it. I think it is an enormous market. Whether it be Greg Norman bringing golfers to Australia or the Illawarra region and its sporting teams attracting people from the south west of Sydney or whatever, those visitors are all important. In fact, the Illawarra Tourist Association estimates the tourist dollar which comes in on a daily basis is well in excess of several million dollars a year, into an economy like that of the Illawarra which is battling to diversify its economic base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are doing in the Illawarra is not dissimilar to what people would like to do in the Hunter with the attractions of the vineyards and in parts of Western Australia with which the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) is very familiar. Broome is a place that has been mentioned, and there is the south-west of Western Australia, Margaret River and so on. They are all very attractive areas. They are all important destinations which need promotion, but it is important to get the coordinated strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The report I mentioned, the Illawarra Regional Development Strategy, typifies that very thing. We in fact said there was a need to coordinate the role being played by the Illawarra Tourist Association with that of the State Department of Tourism, which was drawing up tourism plans for different parts of New South Wales. But they need to be speaking with the one voice. It is no good trying to promote in a region things which will just not happen. The tourism benefits, particularly with day trippers in the Illawarra, have to be looked at. The conference market has also expanded, and that has to be promoted. Surely, following that, will be the development of infrastructure to go hand in glove with the needs and the demands as they arise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. The honourable member for Fadden pointed out the problem that we do have with crime. We do not talk about it a lot because we do not wish to draw undue attention to it, but I do want to say, because the honourable member for Fadden mentioned it, that the Goss Labor Government that we now have in Queensland really has not delivered in terms of adequate policing for the Gold Coast. It is a concern, a concern that is not being addressed, and I believe I should bring it forward here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other area of concern is the laxity of the Federal Government in terms of its failure with the business migration program. There is of course now some evidence of an organised crime activity on the Gold Coast. Even in the last week or so a person was forced to leave Australia after having been found to have had contacts with organised crime overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the statement publicly in the last few days that I think there would be many other people in that category, simply because in that area-and indeed owing to the Foreign Investment Review Board's inactivity in this area-there are people who have criminal records overseas coming into the country under various migration programs and they are overstaying. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Bill, a great deal of emphasis has already been given on both sides of the House to the importance of tourism to the Australian economy and I wish to underline that. We also need to recognise the enormous potential we have as a country to increase our share of the world tourism market. We know that tourism already contributes 5.4 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product and accounts for 9 per cent of our export dollars. Although both sides of the House can agree on the importance of tourism, I do not think that we have very much to thank the Government for in terms of what it has actually done for tourism. When we look at the main issues affecting tourism in this country at the moment, we find that the Government has failed. For instance, the issue of a third runway at Sydney Airport is of primary concern to the tourist industry. Yet the Government has vacillated about that for years and still seems to be doing so. A third runway is vital to the tourism industry in Australia. The pilots dispute is another case in point. That dispute did enormous damage to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr Jull</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Fadden says, that is the reason we have had to increase the departure tax-to get revenue together to help out the tourist industry in these difficult times. The handling of the pilots dispute was absolutely deplorable. The dispute did almost irreparable damage to the tourism industry. It sent many small tourist operators out of business. I think the Government needs to be constantly reminded of that. How ironic it is to see the recent deal that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did with the waterfront employees and compare it with the way he handled the pilots dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other day I received a letter-as I hope all honourable members did-from a pilot who was complaining about the fact that he is now unemployed. As I fly around the country, as members of parliament do, I am frequently confronted with pilots who have become Australian citizens because the Government let them into Australia. I am also constantly confronted with Australians, many of whom have for years chosen to live in my electorate, who are now unemployed. Australians who are former pilots with Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines are now unemployed, unable to get jobs-or they are having to go overseas to get jobs and work around the world. That is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilot to whom I referred pointed out-and I agree with him-that this is all about mateship. The waterfront deal was for the mates and the pilots dispute was with the Prime Minister's mate, Sir Peter Abeles. I will never let this Government forget that its handling of the pilots dispute-in my view, the Prime Minister was personally culpable-did irreparable damage to the Australian tourism industry. I will not resile from making that statement at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> An encouraging degree of resilience exists in the tourist industry, despite the recession. We had the pilots dispute and now we have the recession, but we are hanging in there. Fortunately-and I commend the Government on this; we are supporting the Bill-we will have additional funds for tourism promotion. As far as we are concerned, the departure tax is in accord with the general principle of user pays, to the extent that it contributes to government revenue. The costs of maintaining immigration and Customs services are quite significant. I do not have any problem with a tax in this form that contributes indirectly, in the way that it is being collected, towards meeting those costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The two million-odd international visitors that came to Australia in 1989 is a significant number. Looking at the increasing number that we hope to get over the next year or two, the extra revenue from the departure tax will be considerable. We are only talking of increasing the tax from a mere $10 to $20. I think the honourable member for Fadden pointed out that this is quite a small amount compared with what is charged in some countries. But the difference is visibility. In Australia we line up and pay our tax before departure, so we know that we are paying $10 or $20; whereas overseas the tax is included in the price of the ticket. I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Fadden say that he believes initiatives should be taken to ensure that that approach is adopted here-that the airlines, through one mechanism or another, become involved in the collection of the tax by having it incorporated in the price of the ticket. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, problems exist with the system where people have to pay cash before they go, although since some time in 1990 they can use credit cards. Very often people do not have any money left when they go. That is great. I wish every tourist who came to Australia was broke when they left. </PARA>

The problem is that if they do not have the money to pay the tax under the current system, then it is very embarrassing. As the honourable member for Fadden put it, they actually get an IOU. I had a case where a constituent of mine had a relative from Moscow visit him and he left without any money-he probably came without any money too, I suppose-and he got a bluey in the mail that said, `You are advised that failure to pay the tax will render you liable for prosecution under section 6 of the above Act.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might not have got that bad. I wrote to the assistant secretary of the international aviation policy division and said, `Hang on, you have threatened this guy with legal action; are you going to extradite him?'. Many months later I got a response saying that they did not plan to extradite him and, in fact, that the system worked quite well and people, when they were reminded, generally paid up. In any case, if they did not, it would be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would then make a decision about whether he would prosecute to recover the $10, but I was pleased to note that they would take into account the person's domicile, which I took to mean where the person lived. I figured out that it must have cost a considerable amount more than $10 to go through this procedure to collect the departure tax from somebody who left but did not have the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My time is almost expired. I am very pleased to see that a feature of the collection of this additional money is its dedication to tourism promotion. In his second reading speech the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said that the revenue generated will go towards offsetting the costs of the Government's announced increase in funding by $23m for tourism promotion. The coalition certainly welcomes that decision by the Government to increase spending on tourism promotion. Tourism for all that it does for Australia, receives very little government assistance compared with other industries, and particularly compared with the amount of revenue that it actually generates for the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, going back to where I started from, there is great opportunity for Australia to expand its share of the world market and I believe that it is crucial that we do so. It has been said that 8,700 jobs are created for every 10 per cent increase in visitor arrivals. I believe that increasing those visitor arrivals must surely be a major focus in these times of rising unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up a couple of matters that the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) raised in this debate on the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1991, which I think contrasted quite sharply with the comments of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in a number of respects. The matter of the pilots dispute is one that the Opposition talks about frequently. I would have thought that the Opposition's support for the pilots and the action they took is something that it would be trying to move away from as quickly as it possibly could. Looking at the development of our tourism industry, both prior to the pilots dispute and since, one sees how remarkably resilient it has been through difficult economic times and through various other crises in international affairs with the Gulf war and so forth. We have a great story to tell with our tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it has been one of the areas of great achievement of the 1980s to reach the figure of 2.1 million tourists who have come here, particularly in the lead-up to Expo in 1988. Tourism certainly has the potential, as the Departure Tax Amendment Bill provides, with a proper marketing campaign, to ensure not only the doubling of that number but a much greater multiplier, as the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) said earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that for far too long we did not appreciate what a valuable industry this was. All too often in the past we have had discussions about notions of picking winners and whether the Government should be in the business of picking winners in industry structure and development. Tourism is one that we do not have to be seen to be picking the winners in. We have to provide the infrastructure support so that the specialists in tourism can go out and achieve the objective. That is what we are doing through this departure tax. We are providing the mechanism to give the Australian Tourism Commission and the various agencies and affiliates that it uses to sell the campaign internationally in our peak markets the opportunity to sell the message and to achieve the sort of increase that I have referred to. That is noteworthy, given that there has been talk about the expenditure that has been allocated to the Norman campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) was telling me only today that, in the lead-up to the Norman campaign advertisements going to air on television, a print advertising campaign was run in Asia, the United States and Japan. The number of inquiries that that print advertising campaign generated was absolutely enormous, I am told by the Minister, based on the information that he has received from overseas. There is no doubt that that opportunity and scope is there. Certainly, Australia will become an increasingly popular destination. </PARA>
<PARA> This time when the tourism industry really takes off again we will have much of the infrastructure that we lacked when the first campaign with the Hogan commercials was run. One of the things that my predecessor as the member for Parramatta, Mr John Brown, talked about was that at the time that tourism really took off in the early 1980s, as part of the Hogan initiative, we did not have much of the infrastructure and we did not have the facilities in north Queensland, Western Australia or even in areas closer to Sydney where there just were not the facilities required. Today, in all of those regions, there is unique potential for tourists to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to do a number of things as well as run the advertising campaign, which the departure tax achieves in a painless way. We also have to ensure that the developments in aviation are done correctly. We have to ensure that we do have the flexibility ourselves, that we encourage our international partners in these ventures to have flexibility in terms of the access they give to their destinations-their airports and so forth around the world-and that we can get the capacity that Japan should rightly offer in terms of seats on aircraft to encourage more Japanese to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Fadden was quite right in referring to the potential that exists in Asia. That is a market that we have not targeted adequately in the past. There is no doubt that it is one area where there is unique potential. No-one knows how great that will be. I have no doubt that, with the Norman campaign advertising, we will start to see what opportunity there is for Asia in particular-be it Korea or other places-to be a great contributor to at least achieving the five million visitors that the Tourist Commission talks about. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of tourism development which I think is important is that we recognise the integration, as the honourable member for Macarthur referred to earlier, between the various other forms of entertainment and the various other attributes that we have that bring people to Australia. One of the things that I think it is important to develop is flexibility in those arrangements. I have recently been involved in an inquiry, with the honourable member for Macarthur, into such things as the Australian Customs Service and the need to integrate the services that Customs provides to be relevant to the sorts of things that tourist operators and the entrepreneurs in the tourism industry want to do. That means moving away from some of our past practices concerning how Customs does its activities. It means that with places like Hamilton Island, where there is a lot of potential, we have to be flexible and adapt to their needs so that we can not only bring people to those sorts of important holiday destinations but also link them up with cities like Sydney, where there is great potential to run successful packages. </PARA>
<PARA> There are all sorts of facilities that people want to visit in Sydney. Just in the western part of Sydney we now have Australia's Wonderland, the Blue Mountains and Eastern Creek, and hopefully we will shortly be successful with the bid for the Olympic Games. More and more people will be coming to Australia. This means that we have to get an integration of services, the operators have to achieve their objectives precisely, and the Government has to ensure that the various agencies of government involved in that process are very conscious of service needs. The satisfaction people will get from an enjoyable, pleasurable time in Australia will encourage more people to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt at all that we should take very much to heart the multiplier effect we have talked about with jobs and the sort of potential that the industry has as a foreign exchange earner, because it is in the nation's interest to do so. Other speakers in this debate have spoken about the fact that far too often people have been inclined to diminish the worth of jobs in tourism and in the hospitality industry. We cannot afford to do that any more because we have a unique potential here. We have the best climate in the world; we have the peace that so many parts of the world cannot achieve because of difficulties with terrorism and all sorts of other activities that are a cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all else, this vast nation provides a unique opportunity to attract people from the northern hemisphere to Australia at times when they are experiencing an undesirable climate. If we can use the summer period when there are so many people who see the southern hemisphere as a worthwhile place to come to and enjoy their holidays, there is no reason at all why that tourism potential cannot be magnified to an even greater extent than the Australian Tourism Commission has talked about. That will be the test for us. We have to recognise that much of the job creation that will occur-the real jobs that will be created in the next decade-will be in different industries than might have applied in the 1950s and the 1960s. If we recognise that, and we adapt to it, we can take advantage of it for Australia and for the great range of tourist facilities that operate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the time constraints and particularly because my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) wants to have some time to speak in this debate, I will conclude on that note. I certainly welcome this important initiative for the Australian tourist industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The airport tax was first introduced in 1978-79 and it generated income of $12m. In 1988-89 it generated income of $66m and this year the figure will be approximately $42m. The income dropped off because there was a reduction in the tax generally. Of course, the pilots strike seriously affected the tourist industry and therefore the economy. I want to speak very strongly in support of the Departure Tax Amendment Bill. We must understand that the tourist industry in Australia is a growing industry which means a great deal to our economy. I will not go into the figures because the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has given these correctly and has pointed out the evidence that the industry is important to the economy of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise a couple of matters which I believe are important, the first being that Australia is so far away from the rest of the world. This means that the cost of reaching Australia is very great compared with the rest of the tourist countries of the world. We share only about one per cent of tourism generally. We must realise that, if we are to attract extra people to Australia, we have to ensure that it is cheaper to reach the shores of this country. It concerns me at times that Qantas Airways Ltd is somewhat restricted in the opportunities it has to spread itself around the world, particularly to the countries with which we believe there is potential to increase trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that trade agreements have to be reciprocal, but there are countries-America, Japan, Asia, Britain and Europe-who want the opportunity to fly into Australia. The deregulation of airlines within Australia is already showing-we have to see the results-that people can travel around Australia much more cheaply than they were able to a year or so ago. What is happening there can be transmitted to the world scene. I appeal to the Government to allow Qantas to expand and to purchase the extra aircraft that it needs. The extra aircraft that it buys each year are only a small share of what some of the major companies of the world are buying to enable them to keep up with this great opportunity for tourism in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Attracting tourism outside Australia is very competitive. It is an industry that brings over $4 billion a year into Australia. If we can double the turnover of tourism in Australia to $8 billion per year, indirect taxation will amount to $5 billion, which is a very big factor in relation to income to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not only concerned about the airlines getting people to Australia. I also once again raise here in the House the situation concerning Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It has been spoken about already this evening. For goodness sake, let us get people into Australia. Fifty per cent of the people arriving here want to fly into Sydney. Last year 52 per cent wanted to leave Australia through Sydney Airport. Let us accede to the demands and the wishes of these people who want to pay attention to Australia. Not only is it important in relation to our world trade for tourism but it is also important so far as intrastate travel is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish very briefly to say something about the responsibility of private enterprise in the promotion of tourism. The visitors who can afford to come to Australia today spend almost $2,000 each in the time that they are here. That is a lot of money to spend. The fact is that these people look for a good standard of accommodation. They look for certain standards in restaurants and transport, including air and rail and buses and private cars-a mixture of all of these things. A lot of people love to travel by train. In Australia we have never been able to provide the rail transport that people want when crossing Australia, when travelling to Alice Springs and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> People want to do so many different things, including fishing and sport. They want to look at the museums and our countryside. They want to see the beaches. They have great opportunities. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) remarked a while ago, in all seasons-winter, summer, autumn and spring-Australia is a place where people are welcome and can enjoy their time. People from those misty and cold parts of the world want to come here during their winter months, even their summer months, just as we would like to go to north Queensland over our winter months. These are all factors that we have to consider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) for giving me a couple of minutes to make some comments. I know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), has remained here because he is interested in hearing my contribution. Normally we would have found him making his way out of the door, but he is concerned about this issue and he wants to hear my contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) gave a thoughtful and balanced critique of the legislation. The Departure Tax Amendment Bill is not controversial legislation. It is supported by both parties because it will support tourism, which is a very important industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas Airways Ltd is the largest private promoter of Australia as a tourist destination. Many of us are aware of the present parlous state of Qantas. Indeed, there are significant concerns about the management of Qantas and the way it has operated in a difficult environment. I have heard the Minister defend Qantas, because these are difficult times for international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one should compare the performance of Qantas with an airline such as Cathay Pacific, which is an airline of similar size operating in the same region. The operating profit for Cathay Pacific for the calendar year 1990 was $300m, and the last half of 1990 was a difficult period. It must be noted that Cathay Pacific does not have the massive overstaffing difficulty that Qantas is faced with. Strategically, Cathay Pacific picks its markets better than Qantas. It is fair to say that Qantas has recognised that it stretched its resources too widely. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned at the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden when he suggested that we should be considering air service arrangements with countries in the Scandinavian region. I really think that that is outside our ballpark. We need to get our act together in this region first of all. The most critical feature of Cathay Pacific is that it is a customer driven airline, which is absolutely essential in a service industry like tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite the example of my most recent holiday. When we are able to get away from this place, we get the opportunity to travel from time to time. Recently I travelled to the south-west of Western Australia with my family. Unfortunately, my trip to the south-west coincided with the cyclone in Perth when trees were falling across the road before me and behind me all the way. When I got to the chalet units in the karri forest in the deep south of Western Australia the power was unfortunately cut off. After booking into the chalet I discovered that the electricity was off-due to natural causes; not the sort of thing one should be especially concerned about and one should understand. But I was amazed that the people at reception had neglected to tell me that this was the case. So I stumbled around trying to find a candle. The kids thought it was the best holiday ever, but having been kept in the dark, without refrigeration, electric light and heating, I thought it was a terrible problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine my chagrin when 24 hours later the power was still off and then the water cut out because the staff could not pump water into the tank. Again, they neglected to tell me. It goes to the issue of service and providing customer services. In respect of tourism, our airline and the way we provide tourism services, this is something that is most important. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will provide extra funds for the Australian Tourism Commission to promote Australia as a tourist destination. The benefits have been clearly spelt out by the honourable member for Fadden. I support the legislation and I hope we will see the benefits of this flowing into our economy in the years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) It is understood that the Victorian Minister for Education has allocated some $2.9m for teacher aides from funds provided by the Commonwealth under the Disadvantaged Schools Program (DSP).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Approximately 150 teacher aides are already employed in declared government schools under the DSP in basic tasks related to the program such as school-based curriculum development and school/community interaction.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Commonwealth Programs for Schools-Administrative Guidelines for 1990 give the State Minister for Education the responsibility for the detailed administration of the DSP for government schools, including the approval of all school and system level projects in relation to declared government schools, on the advice of the State DSP Committee. The allocation of funds by the Victorian Minister for the provision of funds for teachers aides employed in declared DSP schools is not inconsistent with the Administrative Guidelines for the Program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 October 1990 (Hansard page 2544) the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) asked me a question without notice whether the Commonwealth or any State, other than Victoria, included projections of superannuation liabilities in its debt assessment.

<PARA> The Australian Government Actuary has estimated the Commonwealth's unfunded liabilities in respect of past service benefits of its employees under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. Information in respect of these liabilities is contained in a report entitled `Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme: A Report on Long-term Costs' which was tabled in the Parliament in May 1990.</PARA>
