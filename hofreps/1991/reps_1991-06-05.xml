<PARA> Referendum Options Description Sheet</PARA>
<PARA> The following brief descriptions of a model single member electorates system and a model proportional representation (Hare-Clark) system have been prepared to assist ACT electors to determine their preferred electoral system.</PARA>
<PARA> MODEL SINGLE MEMBER ELECTORATES SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA> * The ACT will be divided into 17 separate electorates. Each electorate will elect one member to the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> * No candidate will be allowed to stand in more than one electorate at a general election.</PARA>
<PARA> * The ballot paper used will look like this:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>[THE DIAGRAM IS OMITTED FROM THE DATABASE; SEE HARDCOPY PAGE 4745]</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> * Voting will take place in each electorate in accordance with the system of voting used to elect members of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> - Instructions on the ballot paper will require voters to show preferences (1, 2 and so on) for all of the candidates standing in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> - Candidates to be elected will have to receive a majority (ie 50% plus 1) of the formal votes in the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> - If no candidate has obtained a majority of votes after first preference votes have been counted, the candidate with the fewest votes will be excluded and his or her votes will be transferred to the remaining candidates who stood next highest in the relevant voters' preferences.</PARA>
<PARA> - This process of excluding candidates with the fewest votes will continue until one candidate has obtained a majority of the votes still in the count.</PARA>
<PARA> * If a member dies, or resigns, or otherwise vacates his or her seat, the vacancy will be filled by a by-election in his or her electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> * The boundaries of electorates will be drawn by bodies independent of the Commonwealth and ACT governments. The criteria which govern the drawing of the boundaries of House of Representatives divisions will apply as nearly as practicable to the drawing of the boundaries of Legislative Assembly electorates.</PARA>
<PARA> * A redrawing of boundaries should take place in the first 12 months after each general election of members of the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> MODEL PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION (HARE-CLARK) SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA> * The ACT will be divided into 3 separate electorates, of which two will elect 5 members each, and one will elect 7 members, to the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> * No candidate will be allowed to stand in more than one electorate at a general election.</PARA>
<PARA> * The ballot paper used will look like this:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>[THE DIAGRAM IS OMITTED FROM THE DATABASE; SEE HARDCOPY PAGE 4746]</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> * The names of candidates within party groups will not be printed in the same position within the group on every ballot paper. Instead, a particular candidate's name will be printed at the top of the group on some ballot papers, in the second position within the group on other ballot papers and so on, so as to share out the positions.</PARA>
<PARA> * The same principle will apply to the printing of independent candidates' names in the column for independents on the ballot paper.</PARA>
<PARA> * Instructions on the ballot paper will require voters to show preferences (1, 2 and so on) for as many candidates as there are vacancies to be filled in the electorate concerned. Voters will have the option of showing as many further preferences as they wish. Seats will then be allocated to the candidates using the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation, as used at elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly:</PARA>
<PARA> - Candidates will have to achieve a quota of votes in order to be elected. The quota will be determined by dividing the number of formal votes by 1 more than the number of vacancies to be filled, and adding 1 to the number so obtained (disregarding any remainder).</PARA>
<PARA> - If an elected candidate obtains surplus votes (ie votes in excess of the quota), the votes will be transferred to other candidates in the count.</PARA>
<PARA> - If vacancies remain to be filled after surplus votes have been transferred, the candidates standing lowest on the count will be excluded and their votes transferred to the remaining candidates who stood next highest in the relevant voters' preferences.</PARA>
<PARA> - This process of distributing the surplus votes of elected candidates and of excluding candidates will continue until all the vacancies have been filled.</PARA>
<PARA> * If a member dies, resigns, or otherwise vacates his or her seat, the vacancy will be filled by a fresh examination of the ballot papers bearing the votes which elected him or her, to determine which of the available candidates who failed to be elected was most preferred by the voters who chose the former member.</PARA>
<PARA> * The boundaries of electorate(s) will be drawn by bodies independent of the Commonwealth and ACT governments. The criteria which govern the drawing of the boundaries of House of Representatives divisions will apply as nearly as practicable to the drawing of the boundaries of Legislative Assembly electorates.</PARA>
<PARA> * A redrawing of boundaries should take place in the first 12 months after each general election of members of the Legislative Assembly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to the table and point out to him that we have another disgraceful situation here with seven Bills for a major restructuring of the fishing industry, six of which were introduced in the early hours of Friday morning. There has been absolutely no time for either the industry or the Parliament, including members of the Opposition, to study the full detail and implications of these Bills. While the fishing industry is anxious to get out from under the wing of the Australian Fisheries Service because of staffing problems, a degree of inefficiency, and inability to manage the industry properly, it must be an affordable and better arrangement. The Fisheries Administration Bill and cognate Bills do not give that guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not prepared to put the fishing industry into a situation where its costs may well increase instead of diminish. For that reason, we are not prepared to support the Bills at this time. We will move in the Senate for the Bills to be sent to a Senate committee to give both the industry and the Parliament the time to consider this massive amount of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Australian Fisheries Service has failed to manage the fisheries or even to prepare adequate legislation-this may not have been the fault of the Service; there may have been drafting problems. The industry is in a very depressed state, with most fisheries subject to gear restrictions, quotas or buy-back schemes. There are increasing restrictions, as I indicated, and that means less income for fishermen. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the House some examples. The northern prawn fishery is to be halved by 1993. In the last four months, the fishery has been reduced by 20 per cent as a result of the government assisted buy-back program, which is mainly paid for by a levy on the remaining fishermen. The southern shark fishery has been reduced from 3,000 tonnes to 800 tonnes-this is being achieved by reducing the number of nets on each boat. The gem fish quota has been abolished, as scientists are concerned for the future of the species. Total allowable catches have been put in place for orange roughie, and individual quotas are to be placed on at least another two species. Tuna quotas have been tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been working on this package of Bills for almost two years, but only the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) legislation was introduced in reasonable time. I admit it was in very good time-it was introduced late last year. But in spite of no legislation, including the AFMA legislation, being passed until this package goes through the Parliament-and if it is diverted to a Senate committee, it will be some considerable time before it finally is enacted by the Parliament-the Government went ahead and appointed a chairman of the selection committee to select members for the board for the proposed Authority. It has even appointed the Chairman of AFMA, Jim McColl-I acknowledge that would be a good appointment-and is employing him as a consultant for $48,000 for 60 days work. It is requiring the fishermen to pay 90 per cent of that. It has also placed advertisements calling for board members-all with no legislation through Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is right. What an arrogant disregard of the Parliament by this Government!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fisheries Administration Bill, the Fisheries Management Bill, the Fishing Levy Bill, the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill, the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Foreign Fishing Licences Levy Bill, and the Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Bill make up the package. Included in the detail of those Bills is the dangerous precedent of the introduction of resource rent tax in an industry in which there is declining income and which is overtaxed already. One can understand, with all of that happening, that the industry would prefer some management body outside the Public Service to ensure greater efficiency and accountability. But all the Bills before us now are not enough for that to be completely done. An Industries Commission inquiry into what the cost sharing arrangements should be is presently under way; it is due to report later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the industry and the Parliament had to wait almost two years for the Government to produce a package, why not wait a little bit longer to see and hear what the Industry Commission has to say-particularly on cost sharing. That is why the referral to a Senate committee is an even better idea, because that will allow time for the Industry Commission report to be included as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the legislation is needed to ensure that fisheries resources are not overexploited; to enable commercial fishing operations to make money by using the best technology to achieve the greatest net returns; to make fishermen profitable so that the Government can introduce a resource rent tax-interesting; to increase industry and community involvement in decision making; to increase flexibility of operations by being outside the Department; to increase independence in day to day decision making with the Minister involved at a strategic level, rather than in operational matters; and to increase incentives to ensure that the AFMA operations are cost efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will develop and implement fishery specific management plans; set sustainable catch quotas; grant ongoing or temporary access to fish resources; monitor the activities of fishermen; monitor the performance of each fishery; and, where necessary, restructure programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other legislation will include the provision for plans of management for all of the fisheries; introduce new arrangements for Commonwealth fishing licences; make important changes to fishing boat licences to gain greater control over fishing operations in Commonwealth waters, including a formal fishing rights register which will give fishermen greater security; establish the rights as an asset against which they can borrow; and existing boat licences will be phased out and replaced with fishery specific entitlements. The Government claims that licences are now issued for only 12 months at a time but under the new scheme they will be ongoing, provided fees are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will also place a ban on driftnet fishing; provide for a resource rent tax on superprofits-and the northern prawn fishery has been named as the most likely first fishery to pay this tax; provide for foreign fishing licences to be fishery specific and valid up to one year and subject to the payment of fees and levies; and establish a research and development corporation. Obviously, there are many very good aims within those points or objectives that have just been read. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are considerable problems with this legislation. First of all, as I said, there is the point that there has been no time to look at the major Bills. Although we have had a chance to look at the AFMA Bill and have tried to obtain answers, we are no happier with it than we are with the Bills that have just been introduced. For example, there is not even a proposed budget for the new Authority and we are told that fishermen must still pay for the fisheries section of the Department, as well as the new Authority; that is double taxation if ever there was. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation does not allow the proposed Authority to undertake broad policy functions. These will continue to be undertaken by the Australian Fisheries Service section of the Department because it is planned to have a branch remaining within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) to handle policy. Therefore, that branch will retain responsibility for the development of resource use and environmental policies; policy matters concerning foreign access; policy on fisheries access rights; the collection of community returns, that is resource rent tax, from the industry; monitoring the effect of taxation rulings on fisheries management; developing policy that will reduce domestic and international marketing impediments for Australian fish products; and monitoring the Authority to ensure that it carries out government objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> What are government objectives? Are they government wishes? What is the point of having an authority if it is going to be subject to the government all the time? The branch will also monitor the general performance and profitability of the fishing industry. Surely this is not a government function unless it is doing this to see whether it can raise taxes on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has also been expressed about staffing. The staff at the Fisheries Service have already been divided as though the new body were in operation, even though no legislation has passed through the Parliament to authorise that. So some staff are classified as DPIE and others as Authority staff. While the Authority will have the power to remove staff it does not want, it will have to pay out Public Service level superannuation, long service and other leave entitlements. Of the approximately 90 positions, there are already 48 acting positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has expressed concern about the lack of power for the Authority and the Authority's being used to move people out of the Department with no thought of the costs, efficiency or impact on the industry. Even the previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now Treasurer (Mr Kerin), has expressed some concern about the industry's ability to pay. I ask the new Minister, as one of his priorities, to consider this real problem of whether the industry has been saddled with something that is just adding greater cost to it rather than creating greater efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the Opposition that believes that there are major problems with this legislation. In a letter dated 24 May to the Executive Director of the Minerals and Fisheries Group within the Department, Mr Doug Walker, the Manager of Legal Services within the Australian Fisheries Service, said among other things-and I want to make the point that somebody within the Fisheries Service itself is expressing great concern about the proposal:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this minute is to place on record my concerns with several aspects of the Fisheries Management Bill 1991, which I believe may have a detrimental impact on the effectiveness of management of fisheries if the Bill proceeds with the following deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The best way that I can describe the Bill is that it is like a dog with three legs with a ball and chain attached to a leg-it will get there. With the time available between now and the Budget Sittings the Bill could be refined to provide a sound basis for fisheries management. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to list the major problems with the drafting of the Bill. Mr Walker expresses his concern about the effectiveness of the management plan provisions and whether it would be possible for a plan to include all the tools necessary for the management of a fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA>As it is unlikely that the fisheries bills will be passed by the Parliament in the current sittings, I believe it would be more productive to make use of the time up until the commencement of the Budget Sittings to critically examine these points in order to provide to the Minister a Fisheries Management Bill which aims at providing a sound basis for AFMA to successfully perform its functions and responsibilities rather than one which will allow AFMA to get by. </PARA>
<PARA>To this I would say amen. The Opposition agrees with those comments and agrees that there should be more time to consider properly all the detail and the implications of this far reaching legislation, particularly as it relates to the future of fishermen, who are already in a depressed economic situation. That is why we are opposed to the Bills at this time and why we believe it is absolutely essential for all of this legislation, including the report of the Industry Commission, to be considered by a Senate committee. If it means that the new Authority, or whatever will come out of that Senate inquiry and then back through Parliament, is not constituted until 1 January next year or even some time later, at least we will have had a more properly thought through proposal for the future of this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have decided to support the Fisheries Administration Bill, the Fisheries Management Bill, the Fishing Levy Bill, the Statutory Fishing Rights Charge Bill, the Foreign Fishing Licences Levy Bill, the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill, and the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill. This is not to deny that there are a whole lot of problems in the industry, but I see the Bill as a definite attempt to look at some of those problems and to respond to industry requests that a management authority be set up. Whether the setting up of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is going to solve a lot of problems that exist one cannot be sure. In fact, I am not very confident that this is entirely the answer. But what I am confident of is that it is another step forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has maintained a very good record on fisheries management during its eight years in office. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who has just spoken, told us that the Senate will appoint a committee to consider the legislation. There is nothing wrong with that. I welcome that because I think that it needs to be talked out well. It has been talked out heavily through the industry for some years. I see nothing wrong with a Senate committee considering the legislation, examining it closely in detail, and perhaps sending some points back to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to some of the honourable member's points, I would say, first, in relation to the extra costs which he has alleged will occur as a result of the setting up of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, that we ought to make it completely clear to the industry that the Authority is established on a viable basis. The Government has clearly stated that it will provide a guarantee that the industry will not pay more in real terms for fisheries management than it does currently until the Government has announced its response to the Industry Commission report on fisheries management costs. It is clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to see an increase in costs as a result of the setting up of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray mentioned also that there is likely to be a tax on the industry. He is saying that the Government is going to monitor the industry, possibly to ensure that it will be able to obtain a tax from the industry. Of course, he is sidestepping what the Government is really about, which is to ensure that we have a more profitable industry. Of course, the industry will pay more tax if it becomes more profitable. There is nothing wrong with that. It is the same as our motive for getting people off unemployment benefits and into the work force. It is mostly so that we can help the people themselves and partly so that we can alleviate the burden on taxpayers through reducing the unemployment benefits being paid out through turning those people into taxpayers. If we can turn more people in the fishing industry into higher taxpayers, well and good, but the aim is certainly not to set up some new tax in an industry which will not be particularly profitable-perhaps with the exception of the northern prawn fishery-in the foreseeable future anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear to me that there is no intention by the Government to reap a sort of super tax from an industry which is already depressed and which will be depressed for some time. The aim of the Authority is to bring everything together so that we will not have those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some ongoing problems in the industry itself which have become quite clear to me in my 10-year association with the industry as a political activist and as the local member. One problem is the lack of unity in the industry. One can get entirely different points of view from different geographic regions of Australia and even from one port. There is a lack of unity. I can recall taking the former New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, now shadow Minister, Jack Hallam to a meeting of fishermen. They began by presenting him with a united approach, but within 10 or 15 minutes they were disputing among themselves the point that they wanted to make to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The unity within the industry has increased substantially since those days. There is less disunity within ports and there is much greater unity in the south-east trawl, for instance, than I have seen for many years. People are getting together and coming to the Government with one voice much more than they did. </PARA>
<PARA> Large firms in some parts of Australia still have more power than people in the industry. This is because people from large firms have more time to put into attending meetings and more funds with which to pay people to look after their fleet while they are at meetings. But for small firms it is much more difficult. People might intend to turn up at a critical meeting organised in an area, but if it turns out to be a good day they will go out fishing because they need the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that one day when I had organised to have a critical meeting between fishing industry representatives, fishermen and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, the fishermen suddenly all had to go out. The matter was so desperate that they sent their wives to meet me and to see the Deputy Commissioner. The case put by those spouses made it very clear to me that they were the real business managers in the industry. I have said to the industry before, and I will say it again now, that it is about time the people managing the businesses-it is the case on farms as well that quite often the women in the partnership are the business managers-were given an increased role in representation at meetings, because some of them are extremely capable and they have been able to put a very strong point of view to government. The industry ought to persevere with that attitude and give the women in the industry more power to make representations to government, because they do it particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what we do see in this legislation is a formal management plan to regulate fisheries on a consistent and clear basis. The Government developed management advisory committees and made those committees more effective and widespread. It took an initiative in fisheries restructuring and provided financial assistance for restructuring. Prior to 1983 there were no restructuring programs to reduce excess fishing capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Government has taken a number of initiatives to reduce capacity. In particular, it established the national fisheries adjustment program in 1985. Perhaps most importantly, in 1989 the Government produced the first clearly articulated policy document in Australia on fisheries management, which sets out exactly what the Government's policy objectives for fisheries are. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which we have before us flows from the New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s policy document. I was pleased to be associated with the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) when, as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, he launched the New Directions policy at Ulladulla. In a very moving ceremony, he presented it not only to industry representatives and the local government in the area which benefits from the existence of the fishing industry but also to one of the children of a great three-generation fisheries family. He indicated the Government's wish that the new directions policy will lead to a long term sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad facts are that fisheries throughout the world are being over exploited and do not offer assurances to the people that want to come into the industry. That is what this management authority and the agenda are all about. Nations throughout the world are putting too much pressure on our planet's fragile fisheries resources and the marine environment which supports them. </PARA>
<PARA> At least the Government has the intestinal fortitude to do something about it. I know that one of the greatest challenges facing the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in understanding the particular sectors of the primary industry portfolio will be to keep up with the fishing industry. I have found that this is not all that easy to do. One can be away from the industry for six months because it has been going well; but problems will suddenly come up again. One needs to keep up with the intricate problems faced by the industry. I really wish the Minister well as he makes that attempt. I know that he will succeed because of his tremendous ability. I look forward to taking the Minister down to Eden, Ulladulla and Bermagui to meet those in the local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us, which follows on from the New Directions policy, indicates that a ban will be placed on driftnet fishing in the Australian fishing zone. It will also enable Australia to ratify the convention concerning the prohibition of fishing with long driftnets in the South Pacific. I can recall asking the leader of a delegation to the South Pacific Conference, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), whether he would allow me to make a speech on the matter. He did allow me to make a speech in which I said that although I did not intend to ask the conference to ban driftnet fishing, I did want us to be aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone from one of the South Pacific countries came up to me and said, `Why don't we do it here and now?' And that actually happened. The South Pacific Conference held in Guam two years ago resolved to move on a ban for driftnet fishing. It took some time to persuade the United States and the United Kingdom representatives. That evening the United States representatives rang Washington. Washington, which wanted a moratorium, at last agreed on a ban. That very important ban on driftnet fishing is being implemented by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for a range of things and I expect later speakers to deal with them. One important aspect of the legislation is that it sets up a new statutory authority, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, to run Commonwealth fisheries. The Authority is going to have close links with industry through its board and management advisory committees. It will be accountable not just to the Government but also to the fishing industry and to the wider community. The industry has been arguing for this for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been framed in a sensible and balanced way. By all means let us have comments from the Senate. But I look forward to the passage of the legislation so that we can have an authority which clearly indicates that we can manage the fisheries in a sensible and balanced way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this matter. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who has just finished his speech, mentioned the need for unity. When people in his electorate and mine, who work in the southern shark and related fisheries, have their backs to the wall, it is amazing how quickly they are forced to become unified. Business managers-and they are not only women-and fishermen right across Victoria have found that they need to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also look forward to taking our new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to my electorate. I dare say that, as a Victorian, he would know the San Remo fishing village very well. I put to him that unless we look very closely at the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 and allow it to go to a Senate select committee, it might not be very long before there is not a San Remo for us to go and look at. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the Minister, who is sitting at the table, the fact that this far-reaching legislation was introduced at 2 a.m. last Friday morning, 31 May. The Government has guillotined most of the legislation that has come before us this session. Indeed, 36 Bills will be passed by this House before we rise late on Thursday evening. </PARA>
<PARA> We are advised that the purpose of the Fisheries Management Bill and cognate Bills is to restructure Australia's fishing industry by establishing a new statutory authority, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, to ensure that the fisheries resources are not overexploited. That will be of benefit not only to fishermen in my electorate of Corinella but also to every fisherman in Australia. The legislation will enable commercial fishing operations to be profitable by encouraging the use of the best technology to achieve the greatest net returns. This will enable the Government to introduce a resources rent tax-a new tax for people in a struggling industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to establish the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities; it seeks to establish a national fishing industry policy council to provide advice to the Government and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority; and it seeks to establish an Australian Fisheries Management Authority selection committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority will increase industry and community involvement in decision making, increase flexibility of operations by being outside the Department and increase independence in the day to day decision making with the Minister involved at a strategic level rather than an operational level. The legislation will also increase incentives to ensure that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's operations are efficient. The Government argues that the Authority will develop and implement fishery specific management plans, set sustainable catch quotas, grant ongoing or temporary access to fishery resources, monitor the activities of fishermen, monitor the performance of each fishery and, where necessary, restructure programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parts of the legislation allow for plans of management of all fisheries, introduce new arrangements for Commonwealth fishing licences and make important changes to fishing boat licences to gain greater control over fishing operations in Commonwealth waters, including a formal fishing rights register which will give fishermen greater security and will establish the rights as an asset against which they can borrow. Existing boat licences will be phased out and replaced with fishery specific entitlements. The Government claims that licences are now issued for only 12 months at a time, which is true, but under the new scheme they will be ongoing, provided the fees are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to place a ban on driftnet fishing, which will be of benefit to the world and Australia. It provides for a resources rent tax to be placed on super profits. The northern prawn industry has been named as the most likely fishery to pay this tax in the first instance. The legislation provides for foreign fishing licences to the specific fishery, valid up to one year and subject to the payment of fees and levies. It also proposes the establishment of a Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems with the legislation. The first I would draw to the Minister's attention is that too little time has been allotted for our shadow Minister, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and for our Party members to really address this issue. That is why we are requesting the Government's support in sending this off to a Senate select committee for further investigation. Given the expanse of this legislation, from 2 a.m. last Friday, 31 May, until today will not allow the Opposition to give it the full coverage that it should, especially having regard to the fact that there are people in my electorate that are specifically concerned about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition doubts that the industry can continue to pay for people in the Department as well as in a new authority, which it is doing at the moment. I draw the Minister's attention to the very depressed state of most fisheries that are now going to be subject to further gear restrictions-I hope that has been brought to the Minister's attention-and quotas or buy-back schemes. My office is full of letters from these fishermen describing their plight and I am going to draw one of them to the Minister's attention in just a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months we have seen the restructuring and the introduction of quotas or restrictions on many of the fisheries due to many boats chasing too few fish. I have a number of fishermen that will argue that this is an incorrect statement. The southern shark fishery has been reduced from 3,000 tonnes to 800 tonnes, and this is being achieved by reducing the number of nets on each boat. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Government that we made a few mistakes with some fishermen. We asked them to do some things and we have now really changed our minds and put many of them in a very difficult position. This is at a time in Victoria when we have tragic economic circumstances which, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of, and I am sure the Minister is; at a time when we have a disgraced former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), still sitting on the back bench of this House and at a time when we have a disgraced Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We are now wanting to change people's lives in the fishing industry at a time when they can least afford it. This is a letter to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now Treasurer (Mr Kerin):</PARA>
<PARA>We write to you as parents who have followed recent events and ask you to please consider our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with dismay that we hear the terms ``scientific evidence'' continually being used as the be all and end all for decision making. The older we get and the more knowledge we gain convinces us that scientific evidence is often open to question. </PARA>
<PARA>You will note through all this that the fishermen are being reasonable. Through this whole exercise the southern shark fishermen that I know have been totally reasonable in their approach and they agree that there is a need for parts of this legislation. But there is also a time here for patience, and we need to be patient in government circles as well as they need to be patient as we ascertain the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>Our concern is for our son and his family. Our son's involvement covers 25 years from deckhand to owner operator. His confidence in the industry and his love of it led he and his wife (both very well educated) to commit themselves to large financial borrowings with the Rural Finance Corporation for the purchase of a 1st class 18 metre vessel. Their sound business practices allowed them to cover expenses and have a reasonable, but not generous standard of living for their family. </PARA>
<PARA>What worries us is that as little as 18 months ago the advice of the Australian Fishery Service southern shark management made it almost mandatory for them to purchase another licence in order to survive after net cut backs. This involved further heavy borrowing from the Rural Finance Corporation. This was only undertaken after consultation with the (previous) Minister's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely it is inhuman that these who acted on this advice are now threatened with further drastic net cut reductions so that their very existence is in jeopardy. As our son's catches have remained the same over the last 2-3 years suggests that something is wrong somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>Please Minister, consider those who took the advice to buy a 2nd licence in order to survive are now given a chance to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA>I have got letter after letter. That one was from the Gair family, from Jan and Sandy Gair, down at San Remo. They are involved, their children are involved and their friends are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The letters go on, but I am sure that I am about to run out of time. But we are not talking about small amounts of money here; we are talking about a few hundreds of thousands of dollars-which are not the sorts of funds that one can come up with in five minutes overnight. The shark fishermen have concerns that they would like to see this Government address itself to. They would like to see this move to a Senate select committee so that there can be a full investigation of all the problems we face in our fishing industry and in other parts of our rural sector. When Victoria is having its toughest time since the 1930s, we need now to address specifically the individual needs of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to care about the township of San Remo because a lot of my boyhood was spent in and around that township. I had a cousin working there as an owner of one of these boats, so I have a particular interest in that area-it is not just that is in my electorate. I have a personal interest in these people, their schools, the traders in the area, the San Remo fishermen's cooperative and all the allied industries that are affected by what is happening with those boats. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably one of the most serious issues that I, unlike the Minister in the last few days, have had to face; one that has severely affected a large group of people in my electorate. Because of that, I have taken a couple of minutes more than I should have, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I thank you for the time that I have been given to speak on this matter and I pray that the Minister will make further investigations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I thank you for your assistance in making it possible for me to speak this morning. I heard the speech of the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent). After he reflects upon his remarks about fishing, he should go back and say to the people of San Remo that the current predicament they face is the result of a failure of fisheries management in the past, and that is what this legislation is designed to deal with. As long as fishing is seen as an exploitable resource and a sustainable yield is not established, people are going to have those problems. But what we have to say to those people is that they simply cannot continue to over-fish an industry and drive it out of existence. We have problems in fishing in the same way that we have problems in the grain industry and in the wool industry; that is, we have had excessive levels of entry to the industry. We have not had a proper management policy in terms of fishing, in particular, and that is what this legislation aims for. It is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I sympathise with the honourable member's concern about his local community. It is a very serious issue. It is not a question of party politics-and I say that very seriously. What members of Parliament have to do is talk to our local communities about properly managed fisheries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fortunate, in a sense, that in Western Australia we have the crayfish or western rock lobster industry, which is one of the model industries in terms of sustainable yield and proper management. But that needs to be replicated in every fishery around Australia because, as the honourable member quite correctly identified, we find that fishing can be a very localised business and a whole town can be dependent upon it. But the future lies in having properly managed fisheries and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority that is being set up is designed to do just that. It is a very important step and that is why I want to support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a couple of points to make. I want to commend warmly the previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, now the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), because he has really taken a global view of fishing and this needed to be done. I note that Alan Newton and Dave Wesney from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy have provided considerable expertise in this area. It is important that we have a thoroughly expert background at departmental level. </PARA>
<PARA> This does afford me the opportunity to say that we saw in the media in the last 24 hours comments about the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), whom I want to endorse as the new Minister. The thing that cannot be said about the Minister is that he does not know the way the world works. He does. He has had lots of experience and he has support in the community. What he inherits from the previous Minister is a properly structured approach to a series of industries and fishing is one of them. I have no doubts about the Minister's ability to handle the job and I think that we now have to move ahead in relation to managing these fisheries. These sorts of debates are very important from that point of view. But I want to refute the nonsense that has been put around about the new Minister not being capable of doing the job. He has the support of all members of the parliamentary Australian Labor Party in that respect; he certainly has my support. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a couple of points to make about the legislation. That very important fisheries management statement that was issued makes it clear that we are looking now at objectives in terms of fisheries management. I think that these are very important to ensure that fisheries resources are not over-exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment. This is a very important statement, because we have to say that to all fisheries. We have problems wherever we look in fisheries where there has not been a proper management regime. Certainly, the northern prawn fishery is one example of that in that it has had to have fleet reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to this question of the management of the western rock lobster industry. We need the research and the levies to support research, so we can come up with a properly biologically based model which will enable us to say what is the level of yield. Then, quite correctly, we can look at the entry numbers and the sorts of licences that are paid for. We can then restrict entry so that we get a sustainable yield and avoid the extraordinary catastrophes that occur. That is the first thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that we must enable commercial fishing operations to be as economically efficient as possible, because at the end of it people are not going to go out there and run commercial risks and take those basically environmental and hazardous risks of running a fishing operation, unless of course there is money in it. This says what should be done, incidentally using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point concerns creating conditions where fishermen are able to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain; that is a very important thing to consider. We see in near coastal fisheries, which are under State control, that there is overexploitation at the commercial level and then the recreational fishing suffers. I say to everyone who looks at fishing that one of the largest industries in terms of activity in Australia is recreational fishing when one looks at the total activity in terms of rods, lines, bait and so on. It happens to be decentralised because it is based around tourism and recreational activity, so we have to recognise that. Such a payment should not reduce the profitability of fishing operations to less than their current levels; that is a sensible statement to include. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is that we have to ensure that the administration of Commonwealth fisheries is conducted on the most efficient and effective basis. I put to the House that I think this legislation does that, and it is very significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to move to another matter which I think is important, and that is the question of access rights. The second reading speech on the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 states that the Government would not auction the access rights of existing fishermen in developed fisheries. It also clearly states that, while an auction or tender may be used to allocate new fishing rights, the Government would ensure that appropriate incentives were provided so that exploration for and development of new fisheries would continue. This statement is very important. We cannot expect fishing operations to go out there and put in substantial amounts of money to develop a fishery unless they are given some guarantee that they will get some reward for that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, I would not want to confer a monopoly right on people who undertake the research and development of a fishery. But I do believe they need an economic return to encourage them to undertake that because, if not, all that happens is that overseas entrants who have got large amounts of capital are encouraged and we in Australia suffer a net loss in terms of our fishing stock. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation does deal with driftnet fishing. There is not a more obscene example of overexploitation and bad exploitation of a resource than driftnet fishing and we in Australia, fortunately, are taking a lead in our region. I must say that some of our regional partners have not got the same level of concern; Taiwan, Japan and South Korea do not show that level of concern and they ought to be put on notice about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am tired of being basically misled by the Japanese about their activities in whaling. They do take whales for commercial purposes and they should stop misleading us. There is a delegation here in Australia at the moment and I hope that it takes that message back to Japan. The Japanese should not try to lie to us about this. The fact is that they do take minke whales; they are in breach of the international conventions on it and they ought to understand that. They should not try to smooth it over with some rhetoric about it, because we know the bottom line. What we have seen in our region is exploitation of fishing resources-and that cannot be accepted by countries such as ours. </PARA>

The basic point about the table is that there is considerable value added in terms of processing prawns and exporting them in a processed form rather than just simply sending them overseas in bulk frozen form. I believe we should be doing that; we should be encouraging exporters to do that. At the same time, incidentally, when one looks at the table one will see that there is a very high level of processed prawns coming into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing that so much of the fisheries legislation has been hurried through the House. It does not really show a great deal of what I would have regarded as appropriate respect for the institution of the Parliament for legislation to be introduced at 2 a.m. on a Friday morning and to be brought on for debate so soon the following week without the Opposition, or indeed members generally, having sufficient time to work through that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it is legislation that is of some concern to me in the electorate of Mayo because there are a large number of fishermen both on Kangaroo Island and in the Fleurieu Peninsula who have a great deal of concern for their future livelihoods. They see their living standards falling and their livelihoods are in some difficulty at the present time. The legislation package introduced by the Government is not legislation which would give them any particular pleasure and certainly provides no assistance to them in this difficult time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all understand the need for some regulation of the fishing industry-the fact that stocks have to be conserved at appropriate levels, otherwise the industry will no longer be sustainable. In order to ensure the conservation of stocks and the proper management of the resource, there inevitably has to be some bureaucratic structure put in place. That is something we all accept. </PARA>
<PARA> What this package of legislation effectively does is establish a completely new bureaucracy-the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). On the face of it, this new bureaucracy will increase the overall cost to the industry and not necessarily provide for an improvement in the management of that industry. When I looked at what I think is one of the critical questions-the role that would be retained by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's policy branch over fisheries issues-and compared that with the various issues which will be transferred to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, I was struck by the fact that although the theory is that the Australian Fisheries Service in the Department is meant to be transferred to a statutory authority, the reality is that two bureaucracies will be established whereas in the past there was just one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is going to retain responsibility for the development of resource use and environmental policies for policy matters concerning foreign access; policy on fisheries access rights; the collection of community returns from the industry; monitoring the effect of taxation rulings on fisheries management; developing policy to reduce domestic and international marketing impediments; monitoring the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to ensure it carries out government objectives; and so the list goes on. The list of functions that the Department is going to retain simply underlines the point that two bureaucracies are being established, whereas in the past one did the job. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the fishing industry, the problem that arises from that simple fact is that it is being asked to cover the costs of the AFMA bureaucracy and arguably those of the bureaucracy within the Department. Perhaps this matter could be clarified by the Minister later. An industry already faced with substantial cost problems through licences, taxes and the like, understandably feels miffed that these additional costs are to be imposed on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in the second reading speech of the then Minister that the Government is now seriously working on the introduction of a resource rent tax for the fishing industry. I want to make a couple of points about that. First, the most obvious point is that this is yet another potential cost burden being imposed on the fishing industry. That is a matter of real concern when that industry is carrying the range of costs I have already described, particularly in these difficult economic times. On top of that we need to address the conceptual question of whether the resource rent tax is an appropriate type of tax to place on an industry of this kind. The argument in favour of a resource rent tax in the mining industry revolves around the fact that minerals are a non-renewable resource. That is clearly not the case for the fishing industry, provided that stocks are properly managed. It is a renewable resource and therefore the argument for a resource rent tax-if you like, the economic rationalist's argument-is substantially weakened on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the industry can take no comfort from the fact that the Government is proposing to introduce a resources rent tax. I gather the Government intends to start that tax on the northern prawn fisheries, which implies that it will then introduce the tax progressively on other areas of the fishing industry. Consequently I think we have every reason to be concerned that this additional cost burden will affect the fishing industry in particular, on the basis of the plans the Opposition has so far been able to obtain for this tax, in years when the industry may be doing well. After all, in an industry whose performance is very much cyclical, the good years help it survive in the bad years. If the Government is seriously proposing a secondary tax during the good years, that will simply make it more difficult for people in the industry to survive the poorer years. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point relates to the importance of the fishing industry as a contributor to Australian exports. For a long time I have felt that this industry could make an even bigger contribution to exports than is currently the case. That is particularly true if our fishing industry is to extend in a more progressive and productive way beyond the 200-mile effective economic zone into international waters. However, we will have to do a couple of things to ensure that the industry becomes a bigger contributor to exports. First, we have to ensure that we have better air links with other parts of the world and with relevant market places. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Taiwan recently with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and Senator Hill, and one message we received from the Taiwanese was that they have a great deal of interest in Australian fisheries products, but lack of direct air links between Australia and Taiwan mean that the market is limited. We know there is a prospect of those direct air links coming into effect next month, which should open up the Taiwanese market more effectively to the Australian fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I use Taiwan only as an example because there is a range of other markets around north-east and south-east Asia that could be very important to our fishing industries. The United States market is also a very important one for those industries. We need to ensure that we have proper air links and freight services into those markets if we are to exploit their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the argument about the export potential of the industry relates to our old friend, competitiveness. I was never a great enthusiast for the idea of the Soviet fishing fleet using an Australian port-it was generally felt that Hobart would be the appropriate port-as a regional base for that fleet. But things have changed very much in the Soviet Union since the days when there were security concerns about that matter. As time has gone on, the argument for the Soviet Union using Hobart or some other Australian port as a potential base has strengthened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fishing Levy Bill is a mechanical piece of legislation that, in terms of the collection of the levy, is relevant to the whole issue of the competitiveness of the fisheries industries in Australia. This brings me to the point I was making earlier about the home basing of a Soviet fishing fleet in an Australian port. One of my concerns about that proposal, given that the security issues have been largely overcome by political developments in the Soviet Union over the past few years, is that the Soviet Union eventually decided to use Singapore as the base rather than an Australian fishing port.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That had two consequences: first, the maintenance work that would have gone to Australian companies and employees was lost to Singapore; and, secondly, the fishing industry was very hopeful that if the Soviets were to use an Australian port as a base for their fishing industry there would be the opportunity for what is known in other industries as technology transfers-that is, the Australian fishing industry would have some access to the very sophisticated Soviet fishing technology. That was part of the negotiations between the Government and the Soviet Union on that proposition. The Soviet Union, however, decided on the basis of cost to go to Singapore, and Australia lost the opportunity to benefit from the technology transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that was ever a black and white issue. As I said earlier, there were always concerns about the security issues involved, at least in some Australian ports. It must also be said that, because of political changes in the Soviet Union, the arguments for basing the regional Soviet fishing fleet in Hobart or perhaps in Port Lincoln were a lot stronger than previously was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, these Bills, which have been debated in cognate form, are not good news for the fishing industry or for fishermen on Kangaroo Island or on the south coast of South Australia. I regret this legislation and that the Government continues to feel driven by the need to introduce additional bureaucracies, costs and taxes. The Government's rhetoric is often quite right on a lot of these issues: we need to make our country more competitive and we need to undertake micro-economic reform and all those sorts of things. But the simple reality is that this type of legislation does not achieve the objectives that are part and parcel of the Government's rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of issues have been raised and I will try to deal with them quickly in the time available. First, it is important to understand that the Government is guaranteeing that fishermen will not have to pay more in real terms for fisheries management costs than they did in 1990-91. The Government has made that commitment and will hold to it until it reviews that position consequent upon receiving the report on this issue from the Industry Commission. Once it has that report the Government, in arriving at its decision, will involve itself in full consultation with the industry before it makes a decision. I make that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of additional costs, it is important to recognise that the Government has committed itself to make one-off payments for the establishment cost of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), which will total some millions of dollars. We will ensure that they cover the issue of retrenchment, and that cost will be borne not by AFMA but through the Public Service Act transfer. The cost of furniture, equipment and other current assets being used in fishermen's management work will also be met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst we have the time, I should also go to this issue of the resource rent tax because it has been raised by a number of members from the Opposition. They have suggested that the passage of these Bills constitutes some sort of Government plot to impose a resource rent tax on fisheries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple facts of the matter are that the resource rent tax can apply only in circumstances in which supernormal profits are being made. Quite frankly, I think both sides of the House would be pretty happy if we were operating in such an environment in relation to this industry. Unfortunately, the reason for the development of this Bill is that the industry is suffering from past management practices. The fact is that we have seen excessive pressure on resources, overfishing and declining profitability of the industry; and there is a need for the Government to bite the bullet and introduce a strategy for sensible management of our fisheries industry. In that regard, I agree entirely with the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and also draw on his analogy of the successful strategy that has been developed in relation to the western rock lobster. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have this decline in stocks and the fact that we have got this pressure on the fishing industry means that the resource rent tax is completely out of the issue so far as this industry is concerned, and I think is out of the issue for the time being. In any event, my predecessor has given a guarantee that, if there is to be a resource rent tax considered, it will apply only in relation to new fisheries or existing ones after they have been restructured, and only after there has been full consultation by the industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the northern prawn fishery, we have to recognise that there has been a great effort to restructure that industry. We have seen a reduction in the number of vessels and the fishing effort and, as I understand it, the restructuring program will conclude in 1993. Only after that, if there are supernormal profits-and again one has to look at the principle upon which the resource rent tax is levied, and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) did go to that point in his speech-can we even start contemplating the issue of the resource rent tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point, and I commit myself to the same basis of approach as my predecessor: that is, we are not looking at the issue at the moment. If we do get to a situation, after restructuring and in relation to new fisheries areas, in which we do have this supernormal profit circumstance, then the Government will not proceed in relation to the resource rent tax issue until it has had full consultation with the industry. I simply make the point that, in terms of the fishing industries debate, the resource rent tax is something of a red herring, and I hope that the comments that I have made will help to reassure the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time available, I reiterate the point that it is essential, in our view, that this legislation proceed. I understand the issues that have been raised on the other side, but we have to get this strategy in place. The strategy will not proceed properly if we put it to a committee in the Senate and defer implementation until the beginning of next year. We have to act now. We have to act sensibly and we have to act in the spirit of cooperation with the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is now considering this additional Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, and I advise that the Liberal and National parties are not opposed to this legislation. We in fact support what represents a steal from the coalition policy on veterans' affairs embraced by this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In turning to the detail of the legislation, one of the interesting things is that, with the passage of time, elements in the veterans' legislation relating to the Boer war-which, I am sure the boys and girls in the gallery would know, took place towards the end of the last century in South Africa and involved many Australian troops, mainly as individuals but others in units-are being removed from the legislation because they are no longer required as, sadly, there are no longer directly entitled Boer war veterans alive in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does not completely remove the responsibility of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Repatriation Commission and, more particularly, the Australian War Graves Office, because there are many war graves in South Africa that still need to be maintained and cared for as part of the apparatus which operates elsewhere in the world through the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), I and many others take a deep interest in visiting war graves around the world-especially Australian war graves-when the opportunity arises. In my case, on the limited opportunities I have had to travel beyond Asia-or would want to travel beyond Asia-I visit war cemeteries. I had the privilege two weeks ago of visiting Crete for the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Crete. </PARA>
<PARA> The occasion was a credit to the Government of Greece and to all participants. It was a very successful anniversary commemoration of that horrific and important battle on the island of Crete. A number of moving services were conducted at many war cemeteries, especially along the northern coast of Crete. Chancellor Kohl of West Germany also attended and made a speech of atonement. He participated and laid wreaths, as did representatives from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and Greece, along with many others. </PARA>
<PARA> A highlight of the visit was the very warm welcome given to Australian diggers and the New Zealand contingent as they marched through the streets of towns such as Khania. A very warm reception was given. Many links of yesteryear were re-established between the locals and individual veterans who had not been back to the island of Crete. It was a privilege to see and to participate in that service, together with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs; the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus); the shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock); and many others. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this legislation, whether it is war graves in Greece or in Bangladesh, I have been to two areas of great tranquillity in Bangladesh at Chittagong and Comilla, where the magnificent war cemeteries are maintained directly by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is perhaps the only area in Bangladesh where there is peace and tranquillity. The gardens associated with the war cemetery are magnificent and well maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Africa, I visited the grave of Breaker Morant and the adjoining grave of Handcock in Pretoria. They were two Australians who lost their lives as a consequence of a court martial, which has been the subject of considerable controversy. I wanted to see the condition of those two war graves. They were veterans of the Boer War. Those two war graves are only two of the many war graves in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to give an assurance that, whilst this legislation repeals the Boer War provisions of the underlying parent legislation, there will be a continuing commitment by the Australian Government and the Australian War Graves office to the Australian graves which exist in South Africa, notably, just near Pretoria. </PARA>
<PARA> On my visit to the grave of Breaker Morant at the end of an extremely busy day, at sunset, I drew out my camera, stepped back to get a better angle to take a photo, and managed to trip on a rock alongside the war grave. I crashed to the ground into a pile of dust. The camera went one way and my shoe flew off the other way. I ended up leaning across the end of the war grave, lying on the ground, looking up at Breaker Morant's cross and the statement underneath it, `Rest in peace'. I am quite sure that Breaker would be delighted that, 90 years after his death, he is still tripping up figures of authority, because he brought me crashing to the earth on that particular occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is in South Africa as I speak, and that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is contemplating going there later this year, should he be Prime Minister at the time. Other members of the Government at long last are contemplating returning to South Africa, following in the footsteps of many members of the Liberal and National parties, including the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). When they visit Pretoria, I recommend that they take the opportunity to visit Breaker Morant's war grave and other war graves in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the legislation provides that the dependants of female veterans have similar conditions to the dependants of male veterans. This arises from the fact that service women were part of the crews which were sent to the Persian Gulf during the recent Gulf war. Service women in the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force are playing an enhanced role in their service, and this is as it should be, within logical constraints. The legislation should not discriminate against service women. I know it would be of particular interest to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that this legislation moves to correct, to provide for, and to close off a number of areas of anomaly between servicemen and their dependants and female veteran service women and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have a specific policy commitment, which has been longstanding. As the then shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, I helped formulate the policy, and it has continued to be pursued by Senator Newman. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National Parties will remove anomalies and forms of discrimination on the grounds of a veteran's gender. </PARA>
<PARA>So we welcome the step this legislation takes to make further progress down that path and to provide assistance on a more even-handed basis. The armed forces of the 1990s are quite different from the structure and modus operandi of the armed forces in World War II, World War I and the Boer War. Circumstances will continue to change with regard to the armed forces. We know the world is unstable and that events can suddenly arise. Twelve months ago there was no contemplation that this Parliament would be committing Australian service personnel to battle. A couple of months later this Parliament had to do just that and our contingent went to the Gulf. It included ships, a large naval contingent, members of the Army and some members of the Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to say again that this contingent served Australia well in the best traditions of Anzac. It maintained the entirely professional standards of the Australian armed forces generated over decades. Australians can be proud of the contribution they made. It is entirely proper that the Parliament, as quickly as possible, corrects those anomalies which relate to service women who went to the Gulf. They were at a disadvantage in terms of veterans' entitlements compared with service men. I welcome those aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two other aspects that relate to and arise from this legislation. As Australia goes through this horrific economic recession, which in many parts of Australia is more of a depression than a recession, the well-being and value of entitlements of veterans, ex-service men and women, war widows and, indeed, pensioners generally are very much related to the existing general standard of living. They are, however, also very much related to the real purchasing power of the Australian dollar and to the general Australian economic climate. We cannot divorce the two. </PARA>
<PARA> In one sense, it is absurd to argue for a particular variation of entitlement-for example, an increase of a couple of dollars a week-if, at the same time, elsewhere the policies of the Government and the economic circumstances of Australia are such that the real value of those extra dollars has been completely whittled away and other cost burdens have been created by the plunging economy, by the recession we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much in the interests of veterans and elderly citizens in general that Australia enjoy circumstances of economic viability, a growth economy, one which is properly balanced and internationally competitive. Unless all those things are arrived at, the plunging economic circumstances which will prevail as Australia misses the boat throughout this decade of the 1990s will ultimately take away from the actual standard of living of veterans and pensioners, no matter what the particular value and rate of pension might be. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I put to the House very seriously, in response to comments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and others in debates on related legislation, that the veterans should be arguing just as strongly for taxation reform, industrial relations reform, protection reform and micro-economic reform, because those four areas of reform are essential to the maintenance of the wherewithal of the Australian economy in the 1990s. Unless the economy is brought back on the rails, the lot of veterans and of pensioners generally is going to be horrific throughout the rest of the 1990s, no matter what the actual level of pension payment received, partly pertaining to and provided for in this legislation, is. </PARA>
<PARA> So very clearly, in the context of this Bill, which deals with a particular range of entitlements, the veterans' constituency cannot divorce itself from the more general economic arguments if it is to provide the best framework for value in the pension dollar and in the pension entitlement and, therefore, its members' best standard of living and quality of life. These people so richly deserve to have a fair go and deserve to be properly catered for in their senior years in a way which it is the absolute obligation of this Parliament and of the government of the day to ensure. </PARA>
<PARA> In those terms, as a positive step for veterans and pensioners, the coalition has a commitment, as part of its taxation reform, to abolish sales tax and to reduce fuel taxation as a rebate on all business inputs as part of our goods and services tax package. They are central to the well-being and future standard of living and quality of life of veterans and pensioners. It is about time that we had some balance and sanity in the debate on the goods and services tax, and it is seen as part of the reform agenda so essential to getting this country back on the rails and putting real value into those entitlement dollars and those pensioner dollars which are provided for, in part, by the legislation before the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not dwell on this point as I can see, Madam Deputy Speaker, from your body language and from your further examination of the Bill before you, that you might have some concern. So in anticipation of that concern, let me take the opportunity to add that no doubt this is one of the related issues that are being discussed by delegates at the Seventy-fifth Anniversary National Conference of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) in Melbourne, which a number of members of this Parliament are attending. In fairness to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I should point out that he is at that conference this morning. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is also addressing that conference this morning and, subject to fog, I propose to take up my invitation to speak at that conference tomorrow morning in Melbourne. I am sorry that the conference is not being held in Canberra, this being a parliamentary sitting week. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would allow me to salute the work of the RSL over 75 years. Indeed, the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), indicates that he would agree with that sentiment. That organisation has made a powerful and important contribution to Australia and to the well-being of veterans, ex-service men and women and war widows. I congratulate that organisation on its seventy-fifth anniversary and wish it well in the difficult role it has to play in an increasingly competitive Australia and also in resolving the inevitable conflicts which will emerge in such a large organisation as the RSL. I wish that organisation well and I congratulate it. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in respect of this legislation, I signify that the Liberal and National parties support it in the knowledge that since the end of the Boer war more than nine decades have elapsed, and this legislation reflects that fact. The shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Jocelyn Newman, in another place will dwell on further details associated with this quite important legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also commend the legislation for the way in which it continues the progress towards plain-English drafting of legislation. The need does exist in this increasingly complicated and bureaucratic society to make every effort to communicate in layman's language and to provide a basis for legislation concerning entitlements for veterans which the client community involved can readily understand. In that regard, the plain-English initiatives, with regard to both social security legislation and veterans' affairs legislation, is welcomed by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite fitting that a woman should be in the chair while this House abolishes, at last, one of the most unjust discriminatory measures which has ever existed in Australian legislation. I, as a woman, am very glad to be speaking on this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, because it brings into law, at last, a commitment to remove from the Veterans Entitlement Act a totally unjust and unjustifiable discrimination relating to the payment of benefits to dependants of eligible female service and ex-service women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ex-servicewomen have been fighting for years to remove this discrimination, which has existed since their time of service in World War II. I am going to claim the removal of this discrimination as a victory for Mrs June Stone and the Council of Ex-service Women's Associations of New South Wales, for the women of the Government Status of Women Committee and the Welfare Committee women, who took up this challenge some years ago when Mrs Stone first brought it to our attention. But it took a long time for it actually to become law, and I cannot help noticing, as everyone does, that, despite the work done by Mrs Stone and the women of the Caucus, it was actually the Gulf war which made it impossible for any government to allow this discrimination to continue, because women are now currently serving in our forces and cannot be discriminated against as were the women who served in World War II. Nevertheless, government attention has been forced to this issue at the moment and the anomaly is removed in relation not just to women currently serving but also to those women still with us who served in World War II and wars since. The changes that are being made will allow the provision of a war widower's pension to the widowers of entitled servicewomen and ex-servicewomen on the same terms and conditions as those applying to the widows of servicemen and male veterans. Widowers of eligible servicewomen will be entitled to apply for a defence service homes loan and male spouses will be eligible to apply for a service pension. The total upper limit cost of these measures is probably about $1.7m in the first full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will have noticed that I struggled with the words `widow' and `widower' and all the convoluted sexist language used. Had we used the word `spouse' all along, perhaps some of these legislative difficulties would not have arisen and legislators would have been forced to realise that women as well as men were serving their country overseas, and the entitlements would have extended to all their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 11(1) (b) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 discriminates against the dependants of female veterans and the veterans themselves. It provides that in respect of a female veteran a child of the veteran is a dependant of the veteran, whereas section 11 (1) (a) states that a male veteran's dependants include his wife, widow, de facto partner and child. As a consequence, the dependants of female veterans could not receive service pensions or widowers' pensions when female veterans died due to service-related causes and they were not eligible for defence service home loans. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mrs June Stone brought this matter to our attention-she has been fighting this battle for years-we were astonished to find that it had been Australian Labor Party policy in 1984 to get rid of this discrimination and that former Senator Arthur Gietzelt, the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, had fought, but unfortunately not succeeded, to get this anomaly removed. So we set about trying to find out from the Department exactly how many women's dependants would be affected. We asked: how many women enlisted as servicewomen, how many women served overseas, how many women married and have now outlived their husbands, how many women would seek assistance due to the take-up rate of people at that stage, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We knew all the information was there, but, with the best will in the world, when bureaucrats are faced with a determined group of women absolutely intent on amending the legislation, all the barriers come up: it would cost too much, there are too many, and so on. It was really quite extraordinary to imagine that there were too many remaining spouses of ex-servicewomen who had fought overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It took a long time to get the figures, but it was a great exercise for us all. I again congratulate Mrs June Stone and all the women of her council on having this anomaly removed at last. The Government was finally forced to focus on it because of the women currently serving overseas as a result of the Gulf war. Let us hope that there will be no more wars to give women the privilege of serving their country overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this is not the only thing that Mrs Stone and her Council of Ex-servicewomen's Associations are fighting for. They constantly remind us-recently Mrs Stone appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into the status of women-that women who have served their country in a time of war have constantly been discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Stone claims, and I think her claim is very well based, that women who thought they may have to go overseas once they enlisted but who did not go overseas, should be entitled to the full benefits received by those who went overseas. This is, of course, a less clear discrimination, because men who did not go to theatres of war are also not entitled to some of the benefits received by those who went overseas. Mrs Stone makes a very good case for the way in which women were discriminated against at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, it was the very discrimination against women which prevented them from going overseas. The reluctance of the armed forces to allow women to join them overseas prevented them going, no matter how much they were willing and no matter how much they actually expected to be sent overseas. Mrs Stone states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . comparatively few of the women of Australia's Defence Forces served overseas in theatres of war during World War II-</PARA>
<PARA>that is why this anomaly should have been removed many years ago; it certainly was not going to cost the Government much-</PARA>
<PARA>and therefore not many receive the recognition and the benefits accorded to returned personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of women replaced men in Australia's Navy, Army and Air Force freeing them for overseas service and these women made up the bulk of home service personnel in 1944. Their voluntary enlistment meant for many immense psychological and physical strain for some years as they worked on chemical warfare units; with searchlight and gunnery units; plotting enemy shipping along Australia's coastline; in intelligence work; maintaining and servicing aircraft and some became experts in the various trades they learned within the Service in which they had enlisted. Servicewomen were posted to remote areas totally alien to their prewar background and, together with the men with whom they worked, they suffered through the hazards they encountered and the hardships they experienced because of poor diet, lack of facilities and vagaries of the climate. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on for some time about the hardships suffered by those women. Mrs Stone points out that the men alongside whom the women worked were entitled to benefits even though they did not go overseas. The women were not entitled to these benefits. She points out that any man who enlisted or who was appointed for service to go overseas was entitled to a defence service home loan, which is one of the areas of discrimination. A woman could have been working on aircraft or building aircraft-she could have been doing all the things the men were doing next to her. She could have worked beside a man who received a loan to which she was not entitled. In fact, Mrs Stone points out that that was the case within her own family. That is not the basis of this Bill. We are at last removing an anomaly-a totally obvious discrimination against women-which no government since World War II has sought to remove. On behalf of Mrs Stone and her council, and the women in the Government who support her, I point out that there are still discriminations to be removed against the women who fought and served our country so well in previous wars, and who are still doing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh). I appreciate that a large number of groups have been working on this matter for a long time, and she has rightly mentioned and congratulated them in her speech. I find it quite extraordinary that the so-called social justice party has been looking at this issue since 1984, yet nothing whatsoever has been done. It is amazing that it took the Gulf war conflict-which I note the honourable member for Phillip did not support, in any event-to raise this matter and bring it to a head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member may not be aware that others apart from a large number of groups which she has mentioned have assisted in this matter. She failed to mention my colleague, Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel who, single-handedly, got this issue to the table today. She deserves the congratulations of the honourable member for Phillip, the congratulations of this House, and the congratulations of the whole veteran community. I am surprised that it was not mentioned in the honourable member's speech today. Senator Newman has single-handedly been responsible for this legislation. On behalf of the veteran community, I pass on my thanks to her. The shadow Minister is quite rightly acquiring an excellent reputation in this area. She is very widely respected amongst the veteran community, and I have no doubt she will make an excellent Minister after the next election. On 9 January this year Senator Newman put out a press release, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian servicewomen serving in the Gulf war zone are being unlawfully denied equality of veterans entitlements, because of defective legislation and a lack of concern by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that this lack of concern goes back to 1984, and not sooner, which was my initial understanding. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Federal Minister responsible, Mr. Ben Humphreys has today wrongly claimed that full repatriation benefits will be available to Australian Defence Force Personnel on active service in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the honourable member for Phillip tells us that the Australian Labor Party's so-called concern about this goes back to 1984, yet in January of this year the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) apparently had no idea what the entitlements were and what they were not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says, `Rubbish'. The simple fact is that he did not know. If she wants to stick up for him, as she stuck up for her Party today, that is her concern; but I think she would be extremely wise to discontinue interjections along those lines because she is clearly incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Newman also revealed that the Veterans' Entitlements Act provided only for the wife of a veteran, not the husband of a veteran, in the granting of service pensions. She also drew attention to the fact that a war widow's pension can be granted to the spouse of an eligible ex-serviceman but that there is no equal entitlement for a war widower's pension for the spouse of an eligible ex-servicewoman. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of my Party goes further than that. Our veterans' affairs policy statement of August 1988-before the last election-stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National Parties will remove anomalies and forms of discrimination on the grounds of a veterans' gender, such as discrimination against the widower of an ex-servicewoman. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the Gulf war, this issue assumed even greater prominence. I find it quite extraordinary-it is a shame the honourable member for Phillip has now left the chamber-that the Johnny-come-latelies in the Labor Party are now jumping up and down about this. I reiterate that it is only because of the work done by Senator Jocelyn Newman and other women's groups around this country that this issue has finally been addressed by this Parliament. It has been a long time coming and, quite obviously, it should have happened far earlier. It makes a great mockery of this social justice Party. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had grubby politics over the last six months, the classic example being the proposed ban on political advertising. That is a real doozey. I honestly do not believe that the honourable member for Phillip could possibly support the attack on freedom of speech contained in that legislation. I am sure that in her heart of hearts, even if she put her hand up for it, deep down she thought it was a gross interference with and attack on freedom of speech, probably the greatest in this country's history. She may send me a letter supporting what I am saying after I leave the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It got worse after that. We then had the second doozey, the daddy of all doozies, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us this week that he blatantly lied to the Australian people for their good. </PARA>

<PARA> The issue went further than that. What we have also seen in relation to veterans recently is the matter of the repatriation private patients scheme. You may have seen this brochure, Madam Deputy Speaker, and other members may have seen it. It was put out by the Minister at extraordinary expense to Australian taxpayers. He also used an excessive stretching of the truth in relation to support for this scheme. He wrote to veterans and said that it had been supported by major veterans' organisations all over Australia. The simple fact is that that is again stretching the truth. It is not true. It is vehemently opposed by the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL). This glossy brochure has been produced telling people what the benefits are going to be. The RSL has been pursuing this matter for some considerable time, and it is simply not getting the answers. I quote from a media release of 26 May by Alf Garland, the National President of the RSL, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . condemned the distribution of the leaflet sent out on 13 May to over 350,000 war veterans and war widows as a deceptive exercise of misinformation and omission. </PARA>

<PARA>The RSL does not support the Scheme because the proposed arrangements after the handover of Repatriation Hospitals to state government control, do not offer the same quality of health care with priority of access as promised by Prime Minister Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of extreme concern to veterans. I took the opportunity to speak about this to the President of the Ballarat branch of the RSL, Mr Athol Pacey, and the Secretary, Rita Middling. I point out to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, that Mr Pacey is a long time supporter of the Labor Party, but he is a man whom I trust implicitly and for whom I have enormous respect. The work he has done for the veterans in Ballarat over many years has not gone unnoticed by them. But he has expressed concern and he wants clarification of these matters, as do a large number of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue appears to be the accessibility question. If that is addressed, some of the problems will go. I remind the House that the Ballarat Base Hospital, for example, has a waiting list of 1,300 to 1,500 people. If this scheme comes in, there has been no guarantee yet that the St John of God Hospital, which presently does take some veterans, will be under the private scheme and will be approved. The other problem the veterans-Mr Pacey and his group-are concerned about is the accessibility of the general public to these public hospitals if this goes ahead. I would hate to see the situation where a division was created between the veterans and the general public in the Ballarat community. I am urging the Minister to ensure that that does not happen. The RSL obviously relies on considerable community support, and the risk is that those divisions will occur as a result of that. </PARA>
<PARA> If the problems can be sorted out, I am the first to admit that for country veterans there will be considerable benefits; but there are other problems about the core of the care that may be provided. There is cancer treatment provided in Melbourne and there is a tuberculosis ward in Melbourne. I think the general view is that this move is extremely premature, given the rapid ageing of the veterans. Despite the Government's rhetoric, we need some firm guarantees for veterans that the standard, quality and accessibility of care will continue under the Minister's scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than sending out glossy brochures telling people that his proposal has the support of the major organisations around Australia, I urge him to sit down and clarify this matter with the veterans' affairs organisations so that it can be put behind us. It is causing enormous concern amongst what is now an ageing and elderly veterans' group. They do not need the sorts of problems that arise with these schemes. They need to know where they are going, and they need to know very shortly. My colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) is yet to speak. I do not want to take up any of his time. I thank the House for this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak, albeit very briefly, on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. I am sure that most of us, if not all of us, on this side of the House would acknowledge that here is yet another example of Government policy being driven by an Opposition initiative. I very much welcome the comments made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) about the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel, Senator Jocelyn Newman. I think Senator Newman has shown a tenacity and a sense of purpose without which legislation such as this would not be brought before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also agree with what the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) said about some of the women's groups, but I would add to what the honourable member for Ballarat said: that is, this very honourable lady who is saying these things about discrimination and the need to avoid discrimination-and it is unfortunate that she has now left the House-was publicly very much opposed to our commitment in the Gulf; yet several months later wants to support some of these very commendable initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to put on the record in this House some of the comments that Senator Newman made in January this year. They were referred to very briefly by the honourable member for Ballarat. In her press release of 9 January Senator Newman said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Veterans Entitlements Act (1986) is not exempt from the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act (1984) and the lack of equality for veterans benefits is thus unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that I do not think the honourable member for Phillip raised in her contribution to this debate. Senator Newman went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have received from the Minister for Veterans Affairs, the Government is aware of this breach, yet has been unwilling to correct the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>She quoted from one of the letters of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), which said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have no power to waive the present provisions of the Veterans' Affairs legislation to enable widowers . . . to receive a war widows pension. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that, when the Veterans Entitlements Act was drafted in 1986, the question of extending this benefit to the spouses of female veterans was considered but rejected on financial grounds. That is an important point to make: it was rejected by the Government on financial grounds. Senator Newman went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Sex Discrimination Act passed just two years earlier required equal treatment of males and females, unless specifically exempted by law. No such exemption was given to the Veterans Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This was a point made very forcefully by Senator Newman. On 9 January the acting national Secretary of the Returned Services League of Australia, Mrs June Healy, said that the RSL would start negotiations immediately to rectify the anomaly. She said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Our conditions of service committee will roar like Mallee bulls when they hear of this. </PARA>
<PARA>She said that women in the Defence Force who wanted equality of opportunity would be upset to know that their husbands would not be treated in the same way as women spouses. She went on to say that, even if women on the Westralia, the ship deployed at that time, returned safely or were not married, the principle had to be established for other women who served in war zones. On 11 January, continuing and keeping up the fight, Senator Newman said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's office today refused to put in writing a commitment to amend the Veterans Entitlements Act to give a widowers pension to the spouse of a servicewoman killed in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Opposition has welcomed reports from the Minister's office that the Government will amend the Veterans Entitlements Act, I believe that the Government has `wimped' at dealing with other areas of discrimination against women veterans, which remain in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That was conveniently omitted in the contribution by the honourable member for Phillip. On 21 January, as reported in the Hansard of that other place, Senator Newman made the following brief comments:</PARA>
<PARA>I have previously drawn to the Government's attention the fact that there are outstanding issues of concern to the Opposition which relate to the protection of our men and women on active service. To date I have not had any word from the Government that they have been resolved. The Opposition is dissatisfied and angry at this failure because these issues urgently need attention. It is not enough for us to sit for two days debating our commitment of our personnel-</PARA>
<PARA>if honourable members recall, we were debating the actual commitment at that time-</PARA>
<PARA>if they are not given fair and equitable treatment for their service. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three areas that need particular attention. I am glad that the Minister for Defence is in the chamber so I can emphasise the points to him. First of all, all inequality of treatment between male and female servicemen under the Veterans' Entitlements Act must be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, said, `It will be'. In responding, Senator Newman said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was never fair but, now that women are on operational service in combat related positions, it is imperative that this inequality be rectified. I was going to say that the Government must give an undertaking to do so. I take it from the Minister's interjection that that is an undertaking from the Government and I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now history that on 22 January the Minister announced the initiatives which are in the legislation before us today. The following day Senator Newman, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I am very pleased that at long last ex-servicewomen will receive the equal entitlements of ex-servicemen, it was regrettable that it has taken so long, and that it took the Gulf deployment to force the Government to eventually act. </PARA>

<PARA> For too long the Government has refused to correct what has been a blatant breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA>It just seems to me also that over and over again this Government acts only after a lot of push and shove. Here we have a classic example of that push and shove. As I said earlier, if it were not for the persistence, the tenacity and the purpose of our shadow Minister, that would not have happened. I am sure that we would have some disagreement with the Minister on that point. Nevertheless, it is clear from the chronology of events that Senator Newman's initiatives played a very large part in the development of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by paying particular tribute to some of the local people involved in the Toowoomba RSL. They are very much at the back of some of these initiatives to do with women concerning war widows' pensions, et cetera. In particular, I would like to congratulate the local President of the Toowoomba RSL, Eric Grace, and two other gentlemen who are the powers behind a very commendable effort with ex-service men and women: a gentleman by the name of John Marsh, and Clive Brickhill, his assistant, without whose in-depth knowledge of some of these issues our ex-service men and women-a lot of them ageing very much now-would not be receiving the benefits that they deserve. I would like to finish by saying that I and the Opposition very much support what is in this legislation today, but it just seems to me that in many ways it has been too late and perhaps too little. </PARA>

<PARA> I think it is relevant in all the talk there has been in recent days about Australia's involvement in the battle for Crete, for example, that it be acknowledged that Australian women were involved in those engagements and were under fire. I refer particularly to those women who served as nurses and who looked after, as they called them, `the boys'. I know that the injustice has burned in their breasts ever since-that, having gone through that extremity for the sake of their country and Australian servicemen, they were not, for example, entitled to things such as defence service home loans and insurance. I think it will always be a matter of shame to this country that this has taken so long.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Corporations Act 1989 and the Corporations Law. On the whole, the proposed amendments will improve the legislation and the law, and for that reason the Opposition will support it as a whole. I regret to say, however, that this Bill has been introduced without adequate notice. It has been introduced without adequate opportunity for interested groups to peruse it and make submissions on it. It has been introduced without adequate opportunity for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even as late as this morning, I was in contact with the Law Council of Australia to find out its position on this Bill. The Law Council informed me that it did not have a final position because it had not had the opportunity to peruse the Bill. I also note in passing that, under the Corporations Law and the legislation as it stands, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is to have an advisory role in relation to amendments to the Corporations Law. I have been unable to find any advice that that committee has made in relation to this. Indeed, it appears as if the legal subcommittee of that advisory committee is not yet operating. So this Bill comes into the Parliament without an adequate opportunity even for the advisory committee proposed under the legislation to have a careful look at and make comment upon this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we know that the legislative program of the Government is in crisis, and this is but another example of the severe crisis that it is in. This Bill was introduced into the House on Wednesday, 29 May 1991. On Monday, 3 June 1991 the Government declared 33 Bills urgent and provided for them to be guillotined through the Parliament over Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. The Bill having been introduced on 29 May 1991, it is brought on for debate on Wednesday, 5 June. The time allowed for debate under the guillotine is 40 minutes, including time for amendments. Clearly, this is inadequate. Clearly, this is reprehensible in relation to the legislative program of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members believe that the legislation on this matter is simple, they should look at the corporations legislation and law. These documents stand about three inches thick. That legislation affects every company in Australia. It is a complicated piece of legislation and to amend it at such short notice without proper consultation is reprehensible. That is indicative of the way in which the Government treats the Parliament with contempt. Of course, the Government has not been merely guillotining Bills this week; it has been guillotining the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)-and, indeed, 44 members of the Caucus tried to guillotine the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself. However, the problem with instability in the leadership of a government is that it leads to a crisis in the legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament is here to pass legislation, to consult with the community, and to ensure that the legislation that is passed improves the way in which commercial arrangements in Australia are structured and improves the way in which this country is administered. On that kind of program, it is clear that this Parliament is, to a large degree, punting in the dark. It is indicative of a government which is in crisis producing a legislative program which is putting the administration of commercial and other relationships in crisis. Also, it is indicative of how bad things have become under the administration of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This continues a sorry pattern in relation to the amendment of corporations legislation and the Corporations Law. The original Bill, introducing the new national scheme, was introduced on Thursday, 8 November 1990. It had to be debated less than one week later, on Wednesday, 14 November 1990. It was guillotined through with 39 other Bills, and 60 minutes was allowed for its debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has entered the chamber because he ought to think much more carefully about how corporations legislation will be amended in this country and the procedure which he is to engage to do that. He must stand up to the Government and ensure that, at least in his portfolio, there is some semblance of responsibility in the way in which his legislative program is conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> To a large degree, this Bill fixes errors in the original legislation, errors that could have been avoided if the Government had managed its legislative program better in relation to the original legislation. For example, this Bill partially fixes some of the jurisdictional questions omitted from proper consideration in the Act. Prior to the introduction of the Corporations Law, the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia had jurisdiction to deal with matters under the cooperative scheme of companies and securities legislation by virtue of the general cross-vesting scheme for the jurisdiction of courts established by the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Corporations Law, a special cross-vesting regime has been adopted rather than relying on the general cross-vesting scheme to take account of the unique character of the jurisdictional apparatus under the applied law regime of the national companies scheme. Under that regime, the Federal Court of Australia and State Supreme Courts have full coordinate jurisdiction in respect of civil matters arising under the Corporations Law of each jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in its explanatory memorandum, the Government concedes that the Corporations Law cross-vesting scheme currently does not extend to the Family Courts `largely because, in the time available, it was not possible to draft separate satisfactory arrangements'. That is an indictment of the Government's own legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have to come back with this Bill to fix up an error that the Government itself concedes. The same might be said in relation to proposed new section 68a, the preservation of certain exemptions in relation to the State of Western Australia. Again, as the explanatory memorandum makes clear, it is necessary to insert this exemption to pick up exemptions already provided under the old cooperative scheme. When the Government raced its Bill through, again it omitted to make proper provision for that; so this House has to come back and fix it up. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to make sure that it extends every effort to get its legislation right in the first place. By rushing through legislation, time for debate in this House is not necessarily shortened; it just creates problems further down the track. Also, this Bill attempts to come to terms with errors in the original legislation which I pointed out in my speech on the second reading in relation to the original legislation. I pointed out that section 66a, which exempts corporate bodies formed under State laws, such as incorporated associations, cooperative societies and building societies, made no provision for bodies formed under Victorian statutes. The Attorney-General gave a lame explanation during the course of the debate on that Bill as to why that was not done. He said that it had been adequately provided for under State legislation, and so it has; but it was not clear, as I pointed out in the debate, from the face of the record that the provisions had been extended to Victoria. Now we have to come back with an amending Bill to remedy that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, in my speech in the second reading debate on the original legislation, I pointed out that the provisions in relation to the Australian company number were ridiculous-provisions requiring a nine digit number on all business letters, statements of account, invoices, receipts, orders for goods, official notices or publications. I said that they were an overkill, that the Australian company number was not needed in relation to each and every one of those documents. The Government has come back with this Bill to amend the requirement to ensure that the Australian company number is required only on public documents which are intended to be or which are lodged with the Australian Securities Commission up until 31 December 1991. That is good so far as it goes, but what will happen after 31 December 1991? The Australian company number will still be required on all receipts. I urge the Government now to reconsider its position on that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> There is sense in requiring an Australian company number on public documents, formal legal documents and the like so that people know the particular corporate entity that they are trading with. But it is unreasonable to require it on all receipts; for example, in the retail industry a chain of supermarkets such as Coles or Safeway may operate different stores under different corporate structures. Under the requirement, even after the amendment of this Bill, as from 1 January 1992, every time one gets a receipt at the checkout for one's bottle of milk or whatever, the company that is operating that particular store will have to put the name of the company and the nine digit Australian company number on the receipt. It is a legislative overkill to require every milk bar which is operated by company structure, when it takes one's money and gives one a packet of lifesavers, to put an Australian company number on the receipt. </PARA>
<PARA> There is sense in ensuring that people know who they are trading with so that if it ever comes to a question of taking legal proceedings they are clear about the identity of the company. That could be facilitated by requiring companies to exhibit in places where they trade the name of the company, the place of incorporation and the Australian company number. It is a legislative overkill to require the insertion of a nine digit company number on all receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is a legislative overkill to require a nine digit Australian company number on all publications from companies. This means that, if a company advertises in a newspaper, not only does it have to put its name, but it has to put a nine digit Australian company number. In relation to real estate sales, for example, under this legislation, real estate agents who place advertisements for houses are expected to put the Australian company number on the advertisement. The Real Estate Institute of Australia is justly concerned about this. I urge the Government, when it is considering the Australian company number, to take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the amendments in relation to the Australian company number as far as they go, but they ought to go further. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and other members of the Government did not listen when we made these pleas on the original legislation; we hope that they listen now. </PARA>
<PARA> We find, of course, that this Bill does not even deal with all outstanding matters. We have been promised another Bill to deal with the Australian company number and one to deal with fundraising. That is a matter for urgent consideration by this Parliament, particularly in relation to rights issues and dividend reinvestment schemes in relation to prospectus requirements. We have been promised a second Bill in relation to loans to directors, related party transactions and directors' duties. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention to the Attorney-General that the proposed Bill dealing with loans to directors is largely unintelligible. The exposure draft that has been put out ought to be reconsidered and it ought to be put in language that people can understand. Mr John Green of the firm Freehill Hollingdale and Page made some comments on it. He referred to a computer software program called `Right Writer', which is an objective intelligibility testing program, scoring text by the number of years of formal education a person needs to understand it. The acceptable scale ends at 16 years. He asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission to put the exposure draft of the Bill dealing with loans to directors through the program. It agreed. Do honourable members know what the conclusion was? One would need 27 years of formal education to understand the proposed Bill. I see in the Parliament some of my colleagues-men of great learning and education, no doubt-but I doubt whether anybody in this Parliament has the 27 years of education which would facilitate the understanding of that proposed Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raise in relation to the way in which the Bill has come to the Parliament is that this is the first amending Bill under the new arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States under the heads of agreement signed in Alice Springs. They were just heads of agreement; there is still no formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to company law. The Attorney-General has promised that, when the agreement comes, it will come into this Parliament. I urge the Attorney-General to bring it into the Parliament soon, because one of the provisions in relation to the heads of agreement was that, on legislative matters which were not national matters, the Ministerial Council would be consulted, there would be exposure of proposed legislation over a period of three months and the Attorney-General would table the advice of the Ministerial Council when introducing amendments.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only has this Bill in its entirety not been exposed for three months, but the Attorney-General has tabled no advice from the Ministerial Council, as would appear to be required under the Alice Springs heads of agreement in relation to this particular Bill. This is the first amending Bill, and already we see the Commonwealth apparently not complying with the heads of agreement which it has made with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the terms of the Bill itself. Section 1073 is a good amendment to the Corporations Law. It inserts a requirement to comply with covenants in deeds. This will give the Australian Securities Commission the power, through civil enforcement, to enforce trust deeds-a power which I believe is very necessary. If one looks at what has happened in the unit trust industry and a lot of the problems that have arisen as a result of the fall in asset values, as a result of the Government's economic mismanagement and as a result of the inherent weakness in the structure, there are a lot of investors in unit trusts who are now unable to get their money out. There may be cases where some of the asset values in unit trusts have been shaved off because managers or trustees have not observed the obligations that they have; therefore, it is welcome that there will now be power on the part of the Australian Securities Commission to enforce deeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 3 to this particular Bill introduces a requirement for consolidated profit and loss and consolidated balance sheets for various economic entities. Economic entities are to be defined by regulation and the regulations will be disallowable in accordance with the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. It is assumed that the regulations will pick up and rely on Accounting Standard No. 1024, which has been published by the Accounting Standards Review Board. Fortunately, that standard says that it will only apply to companies whose financial years end after 31 December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a good thing that economic entities will be defined in such a way that non-corporations such as trusts, partnerships and individuals can be taken into account, and there can be a requirement to have consolidated profit and loss and balance sheets in relation to those entities. No longer will consolidation be required only in relation to subsidiaries as defined, but they will be required in relation to entities controlled by-and `controlled' is the critical term-a parent. Control is defined to mean:</PARA>
<PARA>The capacity of an entity to dominate decision making directly or indirectly in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so as to enable that other entity to operate with it in achieving the objectives of the controlling entity. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the definition is designed to catch situations where complex corporate structures are set up with the aim of keeping various assets and liabilities-particularly liabilities-off the balance sheet. We saw the shortcoming of the current requirements in relation to accounts in relation to the Adsteam collapse. I have spoken to the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, both of which support the introduction of this new proposed standard. I congratulate the Accounting Standards Review Board for all the work that it has put in in relation to this standard. </PARA>
<PARA> But I must say to the Attorney-General that clearly there is still some disquiet about the matter. I understand that the Attorney-General will have received a letter from Arthur Andersen and Co. dated 27 May 1991, which raises some concerns about part of the definition of control in so far as it relates to the last requirement that control occurs where an economic entity is conducted in such a way that it operates with the parent in achieving the objectives of the controlling entity. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot settle the question here as to whether or not the accounting standard is tight enough. That is a matter, I presume, for the accounting profession and the Australian Accounting Standards Board. But the Attorney ought to give close consideration to that before that regulation is made. </PARA>
<PARA> Arthur Andersen and Co. makes, I believe, a legitimate point that, under that definition, control would be exercised where one was effectively operating the subsidiary or the junior entity, as it were, in accordance with the objectives of the parent. Of course, no director should be operating one company in the interests of another. A director owes his or her duty to the company of which he or she is a director, and if the director is in fact operating that company only to conform to the objectives of another, that director may be breaching the directors' duty in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> To impose that test could effectively impose a test that one would only come in under the provisions requiring consolidated accounts if one was not operating the company properly in the first place; that is, not operating it for its own benefit but operating it for the benefit of another. That is a matter which will have to be looked at very carefully. It is something that we in the Opposition will scrutinise carefully when the regulations are finally drawn up and come before this House. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a change in relation to the obligation to comply with accounting standards. At the moment it is not necessary to comply with prescribed requirements as to financial statements where the directors take the view that to do so would not give a true and fair account of the financial documents. The law will be changed so that it will be necessary to comply with the prescribed requirements and, if the directors form the view that complying with those requirements would not give a true and fair account of the financial statements, they will have to provide additional information. So one complies in the first place and then gives additional information as well if one comes to the view that complying would not give a true and fair view of the accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view that is a welcome change, and I hope it leads to greater and better disclosure of the financial state of a particular company. There is concern in some quarters that companies have not been as forthcoming as they ought to have been in their accounts, and it is imperative that the law does what it can to ensure that disclosure is maximal to creditors, shareholders, lenders and persons who are dealing with companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the other substantive part of the Bill where it amends the current law in relation to insider trading. There has been concern about the efficacy of the current law in relation to insider trading. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs made some recommendations in a report entitled Fair Shares for All: Insider Trading in Australia in October 1989. The essence of the recommendations made by that Committee were that the current structure of the offence of insider trading should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The current structure applies to forbid a person trading in shares where that person is in possession of information not generally available and likely to materially affect the price of shares, and the person is in possession of that information by reason of a connection with the corporation in the preceding six months. The essence of the offence is showing a connection between the inside information and the person who has that information by reason of association with the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation of the Committee was to move away from the requirement of a connection and to prohibit dealing in shares where a person is in possession of information not generally available, regardless of the source of that information. </PARA>
<PARA> An exposure draft was produced in relation to the recommendations in December 1990. That exposure draft was too wide. All it required was that the prosecution show possession of information not generally available, and that it would be likely to materially affect the price of shares if it were generally available. But there would then be an onus on the person prosecuted to show as a defence that he or she did not know or did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the information was not generally available. Rather than that being an element of the offence, showing that one did know or did have reasonable grounds to believe the information was not generally available, the onus was on the person who was charged to establish that as a defence rather than on the prosecutor to establish that mental element in making out the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Government in this Bill has steered away from those proposals in relation to the exposure draft. It is true that there is still criticism from corporate regulators who say that proving intent, or proving that information could be reasonably expected to have a material effect on price, will weaken the structure of the offence and make prosecutions difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is concern in the community that the prosecutors in relation to the offence of insider trading have, to some degree, in some prosecutions, overreached. For that reason it is incumbent upon us to ensure that persons who are charged are adequately protected. For example, there was a prosecution recently in Melbourne in relation to insider trading concerning a Mr de Greenlaw and a Miss Arif. As it turned out, the charges were not proceeded with because those two persons were not committed for trial, and some of the charges were withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> There was in relation to those prosecutions what I consider to be some bad faith shown by those who were conducting the prosecution. Those who were charged were arrested at 6 o'clock in the morning. There were obviously tip-offs to the media, and the television cameras were able to obtain footage. In relation to the arrest, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told that this was part of Australia's biggest ever share racket; 50 investors were involved, 100 companies and $100m. It was alleged that money had been stashed away overseas. The investigators posed for newspaper pictures under the heading `The untouchables'. Shortly after that the then Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), Mr Bosch, declared in a speech:</PARA>
<PARA>I am quite clear in my mind that the people we pursue are guilty. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not clear, of course, that he was referring to those particular arrests, but he was making pronouncements on the guilt of persons who had been charged generally by the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the way for prosecutors to behave. I hope that prosecutors do consider themselves untouchable, but I also hope they have no aspirations to consider themselves media stars. I hope that the NCSC and the Australian Securities Commission will charge only those against whom they have strong proof. I hope they will not fall into the trap of making pronouncements on the guilt or innocence of persons. That is a matter for the courts, after a consideration of the evidence. It turned out that the charges in this case could not be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> So, on balance, these provisions are an improvement. We in the Opposition will closely monitor them, but we have concerns about the way in which some prosecutions have been conducted. For those reasons it is important that we do not throw out all the protections against vexatious or arbitrary conduct in relation to corporate prosecution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole this Bill is an improvement. It fixes problems we have raised; it deals partially with other problems we have raised, such as the Australian company number; it deals with consolidated accounts, although not conclusively; it deals with some of the shortcomings of the current insider trading laws, but in a way which does not leave us without reservations. We support it as far as it goes. We tell the Attorney-General that it has further to go. We urge upon the Attorney-General that when he introduces legislation in the future, he comply with the heads of agreement, he seek public exposure, he seek comment and he allow debate. By doing that, one could get to the business of fixing legislation before these errors occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To put the context of the comments of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) this morning into proper perspective, it is better to use a literary image.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Joseph Heller's book Catch 22, when the character Yossarian comes in to his commanding officer and says, `Look, I've flown 99 missions and I want to go home', the commanding officer says, `It's not enough, we have just upped it to 100'. The following day, having completed 100 missions, Yossarian comes in and says, `I've flown 100 missions, I want to go home'. The commanding officer says, `It is not enough; it is now 101 missions'. Yossarian in Catch 22 was never able to fly enough missions to meet the requirements of his commanding officer. I suspect in relation to this sort of legislation that no matter what tests the Government were to meet, the honourable member for Higgins and his colleagues would say, `You haven't done enough tests'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am serious about that because, to put it into a political context, the Liberal and National parties only recently brought themselves around to supporting the concept of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Western Australia was most famous for having a parliamentary sitting between Christmas and New Year because the upper House could not agree to legislation relating to it. We are not speaking about people who, generally speaking, have made a positive contribution to the debate, although I exempt from that the honourable member for Higgins who in more recent times has taken a very constructive role. I have to say that the Liberal and National parties have not always been motivated by saying, `Let's get this scheme up and running'. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of the heads of agreement. The honourable member for Higgins has already referred to the heads of agreement. It is agreed in the heads of agreement that the States and the Northern Territory have three months in which to examine the matter; however, for this Bill, they all agreed to one month because they wanted to get it done in this session as we are dealing with matters that need to be dealt with in that time. That is not fiction; that is what happened. There is this difficulty: how does one satisfy the demand for urgency-I go back to my friend Yossarian-and the consultation process?</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point to the honourable member for Higgins and other members opposite that in dealing with corporations law we are not dealing with something set in concrete that will remain that way. We set up the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to advise the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Government about changes to the law. We have the ASC operating in the marketplace dealing with the activities of corporations, and we have a parliamentary committee designed to engage in discussing the process and in a sense to supervise the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA> They are all dynamic processes. At no stage does one stop the game; it is not like a freeze-frame in football where one stops the game and leaves it that way for as long as one likes; in fact the game continues. I note that the honourable member for Higgins said that there will be some changes in future; of course there will in the Budget session. I assume there will be changes to this legislation over time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member commented that the Bill was unintelligible unless one has had 27 years of formal education. We are talking about an exposure draft. Unless the Government puts out something with a degree of technical complexity in it, the people in the field are going to say, `Don't give me this nonsense'. I am telling the honourable member for Higgins that there are mechanisms for consultation which are used and tested. The honourable member for Higgins then cannot complain and say, `Look, you are going through this consultation process but you are not going quickly enough'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that the Government is engaged in going through the consultation process. It met this test in terms of the heads of agreement and it has been brought in. I go back to the original Bill, which was subject to an exposure process and to a committee of inquiry process which I chaired. None of these are fiction; they are facts which have been examined. Obviously this place is an adversarial arena and one expects this sort of process to occur, but one has to come back to a few facts about this, which are as I put before the honourable member for Higgins and the House. I think we have to make that very clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also picks up the question of insider trading. In case anyone following this debate has any doubts about insider trading, in 1968-69 more insider trading was conducted in the saloon bar of the Exchange Hotel in Kalgoorlie than almost anywhere else in Australia. Seismologists and geologists came in with inside information and proceeded to trade; in fact they would ring people around Australia to do so. That was, if one likes, the everyday understanding of it, and it happened that way. I quote from Henry Bosch's book on insider trading, in which he quotes Gary Lynch:</PARA>
<PARA> The capital formation process depends on investor confidence in the fairness of securities markets. When committing capital to the markets investors expect that the individuals with whom they deal should not be making investment decisions on information available only to corporate insiders or information wrongly obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>On the following page Mr Bosch, still talking about the question of people raising concerns about insider trading, writes:</PARA>
<PARA> It was hard to reassure them given that, at least in non-legalistic terms, the practices they resented had become commonplace. For example, on 27 December 1985 the Australian Financial Review carried a front-page article headlined `Time to buy takeovers was 10 days ahead'. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The AFR looked at 65 bids for 60 companies made during the first 9 months of 1985 and found their shares rose an average of 9.1% in the 10 days before the bids were announced. </PARA>
<PARA> In 12 cases, the share price rose more than 20% during the 10 day period. In 9, it rose between 10% and 20%. In 13, it rose less than 10%. In 19, the price remained steady and in 8 cases the price actually declined. </PARA>
<PARA> To check whether the report was merely an aberration the NCSC conducted a further survey. Twenty-five later takeovers were examined and it was found that in every case either the price of the takeover target or the volume traded rose significantly just before the bid was announced. Our selection was informed rather than random but it is impossible to believe that this increased buying was a matter of coincidence. It seems clear that certain people became aware of relevant information and either bought in their own right, or more probably caused others to buy, before the announcement was made. </PARA>
<PARA> Insider trading is not by any means limited to takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA>He then provides a model of that. There is a very real concern in the marketplace and amongst would-be investors in relation to insider trading. In fact the Committee discussed an example the other day and I agreed fully with the comments of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) at that time. I think his example of TNT Ltd was most apt; so it is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins referred to changes. The most significant change to the insider trading provisions to be made in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill is the removal of the requirement that there be a connection between the person in possession of inside information and the company to which the information relates. This requirement has been the downfall of a number of insider trading prosecutions. That connection is very significant. I think that crucial issue has been addressed. The provisions will prohibit any person in possession of insider information, regardless of the source of that information, and who knows or reasonably knows that it is insider information from trading in securities of a company to which the information relates. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of key elements in defence which in the past have given rise to difficulties have also been defined, and I will deal with those. Inside information is information which is not generally available, but if it were a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price of securities. We have a clearer definition of what we are dealing with here. Under the current provisions, expert evidence of the likely effect of particular information in the price of securities is required, and information is regarded as generally available, either if it is already in the public arena or has been made known in a manner likely to bring it to the attention of investors when a reasonable period for the dissemination of information has elapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about clearer definitions, and that is important. One of the difficulties in relation to prosecutions has been getting definitions to apply in a case. It is important to emphasise these other matters too: provisions have been extended to insider trading in securities of unit trusts and other prescribed interests. Clearly, as we have seen from the activities in the marketplace, one cannot just focus one's attention upon the equities market; one has to deal with other trading activities in the marketplace. The liabilities of companies and partnerships under the insider trading provisions have also been clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the question of penalties is very important. The criminal penalties for a breach of insider trading provisions are to be increased 10-fold, with a penalty of $200,000 for individuals and $1m for companies. This is twice what was recommended by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Griffiths Committee. This Bill is attempting very realistically to provide greater definition in relation to insider trading and to provide a very clear approach in relation to the link between the individual and knowledge that was obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the onus of proof must also be addressed. The exposure draft was significant in this respect, but if we were to reverse the onus of proof-and this Bill does not do that-it would make prosecution easier. I think it is important to offset this by saying that the increased resources available to the Australian Securities Commission will make it more possible for the ASC to pursue cases. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the matter is not set in concrete, and I say this to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). What this says is that we will examine the process and if as a result of that examination we find that we need to amend the law, then that process will be engaged in. What is clear is that we are in the process of intelligently amending the legislation. I believe that these are intelligent amendments to the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before the House the Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Bill 1991, which is designed to facilitate and encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution procedures in the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. The coalition will not be opposing passage of the Bill for we welcome and support this long awaited and well overdue reform at the Federal level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before proceeding any further, I will give a brief outline of the Bill. Part 2 will amend the Family Law Act 1975 in order to provide for mediation of family law disputes, either before or after the commencement of proceedings; court referred arbitration, which will be subject to full rights of review; and private arbitration to be conducted outside of the court system, which will be subject to review on questions of law only. Part 3 of the Bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 in order to provide for the referral to mediation or arbitration of disputes arising out of existing proceedings . </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year or so the Government has implemented three new reforms in the family law area. Firstly, the Government took the decision in August of last year to increase funding for marriage guidance counselling services; secondly, in March of this year, the Government acceded to a request by the coalition for the establishment of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act; and thirdly, the Government, in the form of the Bill presently before the House, is taking steps to facilitate the introduction of mediation and arbitration services in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> All those measures are referred to in the coalition law and justice policy, which was released in November 1988. On the first measure relating to marriage guidance counselling, I refer to paragraph 9.8 of the Opposition policy:</PARA>
<PARA>The funding of marriage guidance counselling will be increased to enable services to be expanded. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the second measure, the establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to review the Family Law Act, I refer to paragraph 9.3 of the Opposition policy:</PARA>
<PARA>Community concerns about the Family Law Act will be addressed by a Parliamentary Committee which will review the operations of the Family Court and family law, and some of the basic principles on which issues of great importance are determined. </PARA>
<PARA>On the third measure, the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in Family Court proceedings, I refer to paragraph 9.9 of the Opposition's policy:</PARA>
<PARA>In all family law disputes a higher emphasis should be put on counselling, conciliation and mediation. Judges should be seen to be, or should be, the last resort and should exercise a purely judicial role when disputes cannot be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Counselling, conciliation and mediation functions should be separate and distinct from the judicial function . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate the Government for having the wisdom to pick up and act upon these important aspects of the coalition's policy on family law. Quite clearly, as in other spheres, if honourable members want to see a charter for the Government's law reform agenda to be carried out in the remaining days of this tired and dispirited Government, they should simply pick up the Opposition's policy. They will see that, seriatim, the Government is working through the Opposition's program. We do not object. We have devised it for the betterment of Australia. It is just that the Government again is bereft of its own ideas and simply turns to the Opposition's policy, either to negate criticism from this side or, indeed, to implement an effective charter for law reform so far as this particular area of government administration is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the introduction of mediation and arbitration proceedings in the Family Court arena is a much needed and overdue reform. It is a reform that many bodies have been asking for. These include the family law section of the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Family Law Arbitrators. Credit should be given to those bodies for their persistence and perseverance. Unfortunately, however, upon a perusal of the Bill it would seem that we still have a long way to go. In a short while I will elaborate upon that observation in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the financial resources that may be needed effectively to promote mediation and arbitration programs, I note that the explanatory memorandum tabled with the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are considered to be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA>There is expected to be a reallocation of resources. However, the reality is that if court-annexed mediation and arbitration programs are to be successful, it is clear that the courts will need additional resources. This is particularly the case when one has regard to the fact that the modernisation of many of the court buildings for the Family Court and the Federal Court is long overdue. Any practitioner in my own capital city of Melbourne, for instance, will be very familiar with the inadequate and antiquated facilities found in the Family Court and Federal Court buildings. It is near impossible in many cases for the parties to a dispute to sit down and conduct meaningful settlement discussions for the simple reason that they cannot find a spare conference room. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments cannot simply pass laws saying that disputants can avail themselves of alternative dispute resolution procedures if the necessary resources to support such programs are not made available. I am hardly an advocate for increased government expenditure. This side of the House is, of course, advocating the cutting of government expenditure. But the Government should not bring in legislation saying that all these procedures will be available, and that it will be revenue neutral, if the resources are not there to support it. It only frustrates the intent of the legislation, to say nothing of the frustration of the parties involved. The legislative will has to be met with and accompanied by a determination to back up such reforms with an appropriate administrative and financial commitment. This problem is reflected in some provisions of the Bill, which state that a matrimonial dispute may be referred to mediation `if a mediation service is available'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those and many other reasons that the coalition would like to see greater emphasis on the use of mediation and arbitration programs that are separate from and outside the court system. Such an approach would result in a lessening of the burden that is placed on our already underresourced court system, and it would ensure that there is not an empire building element within some of the court systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to consider some aspects of the Bill's drafting. I have raised before the question of drafting of legislation. It is hardly the most scintillating topic for those listening to the debate. The drafting of this legislation I find curious. If we can find enough time in the guillotine processes, I hope the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who, as ever, is good enough to be here when the legislation is drafted, will be able to respond within the appropriate time that I will certainly make available to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in racing through this speech. Perhaps the Attorney-General can clarify some of the queries I am raising in relation to the provisions of part 2 of the Bill, which seeks to insert a new part IIIA into the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 19a will allow disputes relating to family law matters to be referred to mediation prior to the commencement of any proceedings. This can be done if an application is made to the court by a parent, a child or a party to a marriage. I have two queries with respect to this provision. Firstly, is it the case that it will not be necessary for all parties to consent to such a referral? It is often said that for mediations to be conducted successfully it is desirable that any referrals to mediation take place on a consensual basis. The absence of a requirement of full consent by all parties may minimise the prospects of a successful and satisfactory resolution being obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, no provision is made for the court officers to dismiss or reject any complaints which may be considered to be vexatious or frivolous, and there are a number of them in this particular field of jurisdiction. It would seem desirable that such provision be made, and it may well be-perhaps the Attorney-General can confirm whether this is the case-that the rules of the court will be able to address this issue. Perhaps proposed paragraph 123 (1) (sd) will provide the appropriate authority for this, but I must say that the position does not seem clear at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to proposed section 19c, which provides that any communications made during the course of the mediation shall be inadmissible in any court proceedings. Obviously it is desirable that there be obligations of confidentiality in such situations. However, the provision in proposed section 19c very much departs from models found in other jurisdictions. Quite often it is provided that communications made during mediations are inadmissible unless the parties and the mediator agree that such communications should be admitted in subsequent proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> One example is Order 54 Rule 6 (3) of the Victorian County Court Rules of 1979, which deals with the mediation of building disputes. Another example can be found in section 21 (L) of the Victorian Evidence Act, which was introduced by the Evidence (Neighbourhood Mediation Centre) Act of 1987. There are very good reasons why such communications in limited circumstances should be admitted in subsequent proceedings. One reason may be that a settlement agreement has been reached during a mediation and it will be necessary for the terms of that agreement and any relevant communications to be disclosed in order that it be both ascertainable and enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA> This is consistent with the position at common law relating to the admission of without-prejudice negotiations where such negotiations lead to a binding agreement. The leading case in this area, for those who may be interested, is the 1988 decision of the English House of Lords in the case of Rush &amp;Tomkins Ltd v. Greater London Council, a report of which can be found in volume 3 of the All England Reports at page 737. </PARA>
<PARA> The application and relevance of these common law rules in the context of matrimonial disputes also has a long history in England. For those interested in the matter, a very learned discussion of these principles can be found in an article written by Mr J.P. McCrory, entitled `Confidentiality in Mediation of Matrimonial Disputes', which is published in volume 51 of the Modern Law Review, commencing at page 442. So I would ask the Attorney-General to advise the House whether the provisions of proposed section 19c as presently drafted would prevent, in any subsequent proceedings, the admissibility of communications which may be relevant to a binding settlement agreement. I would also ask him to explain why the provisions of proposed section 19d depart from the principles and precedents to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to have these queries, but the next query I have relates to proposed subsection 19d (2), which provides that the Family Court may refer a matter to arbitration `with or without the consent of the parties'. I do have some concern with this provision, for it may well be that a particular party will have very good reasons for insisting that his dispute be dealt with by the court rather than by an arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA> This concern is compounded when one has regard to the fact that court annexed arbitrations will be subject to the full rights of review by way of a complete rehearing. An unwilling party, therefore, could be forced to participate in an arbitration and could then face the possibility of going through a complete rehearing before the court. In my view, this is absolutely undesirable. I was going to mention something from my reading of some of the submissions before the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act at present, but that would be improper. But it is well known that the intrusion of the law and lawyers into the family law arena has been one of the brakes on the satisfactory evolution of family law, despite the 1975 Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fearful that an unwilling party can be dragged off to arbitration, the matter will come back to the court and the whole thing will be reviewed again, at great cost and at no little inconvenience and contrary to the spirit of seeking to resolve these things, if it is possible, in a more amicable way. It is undesirable and could lead to the incurring of unnecessary expense and effort and could prolong the final resolution of a dispute. This would certainly seem contrary to the general principle that arbitral awards should be binding and conclusive, save with respect to questions of law, in order to bring finality to matters in dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have a concern with the provisions of proposed subsection 19f (2) relating to the review of private arbitrations on questions of law. It is provided that upon such a review the full court may `make such decrees as it thinks appropriate, including a decree affirming, reversing or varying the award'. I would hope the word `including' would mean that the Full Court would have the power to remit a matter back to an arbitrator so that it could be dealt with in accordance with any directions given by the court about the proper law to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consider clause 7 of the Bill, which seeks to add to the definition of the phrase `member of the court personnel', as found in section 60 of the Family Law Act, references to approved mediators or approved arbitrators. Earlier this year, Parliament passed the Family Law Amendment Act 1990, which introduced procedures for the handling of custody and access disputes in which allegations of child abuse are made by one party against another. By section 70bb of the Family Law Act, it is now provided that court counsellors and other court personnel, as defined by section 60 of the Act, are obliged to report any suspicions they may have of child abuse, notwithstanding any obligations of confidentiality those personnel may have. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that obligation of disclosure with the secrecy obligations found in the Bill under present consideration, and in this respect I refer to proposed section 19c. By clause 7, it would seem to me, mediators and arbitrators will be placed in the same position as court counsellors and, as such, would be subject to an obligation to report any suspicions of child abuse which may arise from the conduct of mediation. In effect, mediators will be faced with two conflicting obligations-one of confidentiality and one of disclosure. Perhaps the obligation to disclose will override by reason of section 70bc of the Act, which says that court personnel are to report information about suspected cases of child abuse in spite of any obligation of confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we must bear in mind that the present Bill is a later amending Act and, therefore, a court may say that it is intended to override the earlier provisions. In the absence of any specific statutory guidance, this is a matter which should be clarified, for it would seem that mediators and arbitrators will be placed in an awkward position. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of the mediation and arbitration programs will very much depend upon the content of the regulations and the rules of the court which are needed to fill in the many gaps found in the proposed legislation. For example, much will depend upon the approval of suitable mediators and arbitrators by way of statutory regulations. Many bodies, such as the Institute of Arbitrators Australia, have well established programs for the registration and grading of arbitrators; and I would hope that, in forming the regulations, the Attorney-General will consult with such bodies so that their wealth of experience in alternative dispute resolution procedures can be utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill, when contrasted with the provisions of the uniform State commercial arbitration Acts, are clearly deficient. I would have thought that in the area of, say, private negotiations, it may have been sensible to use the cross-vesting of jurisdiction principles to provide that such arbitrations be governed by the comprehensive regime set out in the uniform State legislation. That regime has also been the subject of much discussion before the courts, and in this regard a considerable body of law has evolved, recourse to which could be had if there are any disputes at the Federal level. Instead, under this legislation, there is the real risk that two separate bodies of arbitration law, one Federal and one State, will develop. This will no doubt cause confusion for many practitioners and parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, whilst we have some very strong concerns with the apparent anomalies in the drafting of the Bill, we will not be opposing its passage. The Executive-imposed guillotine prevents me from moving any amendments which would address the anomalies to which I have referred. The concerns that we have with certain aspects of the legislation will in the context of family law, however, be able to be examined, I would trust, by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Family Law Act. Given that the need to introduce alternative dispute resolution procedures at the Federal level is long overdue, it is important that the enabling legislation be put in place at the earliest possible time. It is with some regret, however, that the model being put forward in this Bill by the Government is undoubtedly an imperfect one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much of the credit for the Courts (Mediation and Arbitration) Bill must be attributed to the Government because, on 20 March 1990, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that in its fourth term the Government would legislate to expand alternatives to court proceedings as a means of resolving disputes. This is a very laudable objective. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is essential that the judicial system be as efficient as possible while maintaining the capacity properly to resolve disputes. The use of such processes as mediation and arbitration can help achieve this aim. The Government actively encourages commercial disputes to which it is a party being resolved in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>The options of mediation and arbitration are well known to the law. It has been recognised by the legal profession over a long period of time that it is an efficient way and a cost effective alternative to resolving disputes. Indeed, it has been encouraged in recent legislation, particularly the Family Law Act 1976, and since 1987 within the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his statement of 20 March 1990 promised that the legislation would provide a statutory framework within which the Federal and Family Courts of Australia could, by the use of court rules, establish dispute resolution processes and that the rules would, of necessity, be required to deal with such issues as time limits to lodge documents, basic procedures, privilege for persons taking part in the proceedings, recognition and enforcement of orders and, of course, fees and costs. This Bill does precisely that: it provides a legislative framework to enable the Federal Court and the Family Court of Australia to make rules of court for the conduct of mediation and arbitration procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is important that these rules of court be made before the Act is proclaimed. This will ensure that there will not be an unjustified expectation in the community that a service will be available before the courts have made appropriate arrangements. So the Bill has that so-called facultative aspect about it. But the Federal Court has been involved in so-called court-annexed alternative dispute resolution practices for some time-in fact, since 1987. Indeed, the court has encouraged mediation being performed by registrars of the court with experience as solicitors in litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that the path taken by the Federal Court with respect to alternative dispute resolution practices has been one of evolution rather than revolution. Indeed, many legal practitioners will be familiar, for example, with cases under the Trade Practices Act where smaller matters have been referred to registrars by judges conducting directions hearings where the judges have taken the view or where the parties have requested that the matter should be considered by a mediator. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a general principle which is highly laudable. Business relationships are important between the parties and they can be damaged severely by protracted litigation, particularly in Trade Practices Act matters. This general practice, which originated in the Federal Court-in fact, it was pioneered in Sydney in the principal registry and then expanded to other capital cities throughout Australia-has been developed to the point where today the Chief Justice has issued a practice note on alternative dispute resolution procedures and the rules of court of the Federal Court have been varied to facilitate their use. </PARA>
<PARA> You would be interested to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that more than 300 matters have been referred to mediation since the commencement of this program and that approximately 70 per cent of those have resulted in the matters being finalised. The remaining 30 per cent of matters have proceeded to trial where the issues have been defined in greater detail. The process of mediation conferences is normally determined by a trained and experienced solicitor who occupies the position of one of the registrars of the court. He or she has power to give directions necessary under section 35a of the Federal Court Act to try to narrow the issues between the parties and identify them in more and greater particularity. He or she also has the dual role, of course, of conciliation-dealing with the matter in an informal manner, trying to isolate the issues of liability, for example, and quantum, and trying to settle either one of those matters to save costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important Bill before the House, because the costs of litigation have become a major issue among members of the public. The costs incurred by litigants today, particularly in superior courts, has put the opportunity of conflict resolution for people of limited means in those superior courts completely out of reach unless they obtain legal assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation is part of the ongoing process of law reform initiated by this Government. In this regard, I would like to record the gratitude of the Australian people to the former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, and particularly to the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). I also recognise, in all generosity, the very constructive contribution of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who, on these Bills, has been very informative and very instructive in his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is with respect to arbitrators and mediators. I do flag some concern over this particular issue. Notwithstanding that I said the Federal Court has a training program for arbitrators and mediators, it is important once this program is expanded that arbitrators be legally qualified as they will be responsible for determining questions of law. Furthermore, they will be required to possess the necessary faculties and experience to enjoy the confidence of qualified legal practitioners who appear before them. There is scope, for example, for financial experts to be used as arbitrators, especially in tandem with legally qualified arbitrators. Indeed, it should be understood that the rules of court will have to provide and set court fees as parties may be required to pay for the services of mediators and arbitrators in accordance with the determinations of the rules of court. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Attorney-General responds to the questions put to him by the shadow Attorney-General, I want to record the fact that applications for divorce or declarations as to the validity or for nullity of marriage cannot be arbitrated or mediated-and neither should they be. The contract of marriage not only is a contract of great importance to our community but also, in the eyes of many people, is a sacred contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The dissolution of that contract is not to be treated either informally or in a way which, in my view, should be made more easy than it is today. In this regard, the power to dissolve a marriage or to declare a marriage null and void still rests with the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General mentioned very briefly some of the schemes with respect to the resolution procedures that have been adopted by the Legal Aid Commission in various places in Australia. I acknowledge the fact that in Queensland, for example, there has been a pilot scheme in operation for some time. In fact, this financial year, as I understand it, $220,000 has been provided so that pre-trial mediation conferences, coordinated by the Legal Assistance Commission of Queensland, can be tested in family law cases where the custody of children is at issue. Indeed, it has been a very successful pilot scheme. In my own city of Townsville we have in residence a judge of the Family Court of Australia who has been of great assistance to the legal profession in north Queensland in relation to the administration of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention one other matter, and that is that I believe that care should be exercised by the courts in deciding which disputes should be arbitrated, if a high re-hearing rate is to be avoided. I notice that under new subsection 19d (2) it is provided that a matter may be referred to arbitration, whether or not the parties consent. </PARA>
<PARA> I pick up the observations of the shadow Attorney-General: these disputes cannot be resolved unless there is consensus on both sides. That has been my experience as a solicitor of more than 25 years standing. There must be that meeting of minds between the parties and a determination to resolve the matter on a consensual basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I issue a caution that the courts do need to exercise particular care in proceeding with an order to refer to arbitration matters where there is not full consent by the parties to proceed with that course. Indeed, the courts, as an arm of this legislation, are able to make those rules of court and have a tremendous opportunity to implement in a very ordered way this new law reform, initiated by this Government, and indeed to proceed further down the track enunciated by the Prime Minister back on 20 March 1990 to expand alternatives to court proceedings as a means not only of resolving disputes but also of saving litigants the enormous costs of litigation in superior courts in this country. I congratulate the Government on initiating this much needed law reform in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In the short period available, firstly I would like to thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for his contribution on behalf of the Government. He was supportive of it and raised a couple of matters about which he expressed concern. I understand them, and I also repeat what the honourable member for Herbert said in respect of the Opposition; the contribution by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has also been a constructive contribution to this debate. I thank all concerned on both sides of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the first matters that the honourable member for Kooyong raised, where he indicated a genuine concern, was the matter of consent, and that was the last matter touched on by the honourable member for Herbert. They both made the point, correctly, that consent of both parties is needed for this type of process to work properly. In that respect, the position is that consent is not necessary for the process to be made available. However, it does become an essential part of the process if it is to continue; that is, consent is essential for the continuation of the process but it is not necessary for the process to be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> So I think the simple answer to that question is: yes, the Government is happy with the way it is framed, that is the way it is intended to work, it will be made available and consent is not required for that, but if people then say, `No way are we going to proceed down this track', then of course it would be ridiculous to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another two matters were raised that were interlinked. I will deal with one first and deal with the second a little later. The question of admissibility was raised, and I think confidentiality was linked to that. In respect of section 19c, it is really the same, as was indicated by the honourable member for Kooyong, as section 19 of the Family Law Act, which applies to court counsellors. And, yes, the comments made would prevent, in this type of hearing, the use of communication in subsequent proceedings. The simple answer to the question raised by the honourable member for Kooyong is that they are not admissible. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the query as to section 19f (2), before I come back to the question of confidentiality, the shadow Attorney-General raised in regard to section 19f (2) (b) his concern about `make such decrees as it thinks appropriate, including a decree affirming, reversing or varying an award'. He voiced concern as to whether that included allowing the right to remit the matter. Yes, it does-and it may well be a commentary on drafting there, specifically-because `including' in section 19f (2) (b) is really only as a matter of example; it is not all-embracing. It is including a decree affirming, reversing or varying the award. So the question that I think has been raised correctly is: does it go further than that? Yes, it does; it is only in relation to those two matters which are given really by way of example. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those matters, of course, concern me when they are raised, and they were looked at very carefully before the Bill came into this House. However, one matter which I think does need a little more attention is the question of admissions made to arbitrators, because I think it is an essential aspect of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is intended here is that the new section 19c ensures that anything said in mediation, whether court referred or provided at the request of a person, remains confidential and cannot be used in court proceedings. It is essential, as I think is agreed, that parties to a mediation feel free to speak openly and, as a result of being able to open the whole thing up, be able to explore all the possibilities for settlement. If that is not the case, I do not think we are going to achieve what is the basic thrust of the Bill. This provision, that is, section 19c, makes it clear that no admissions made in mediation can be used against a person in further or later proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of that matter, the shadow Attorney-General did refer, of course-and I think the matter was causing him some concern-to the Family Law Act 1990, particularly section 60, and contrasted the mandatory reporting in child abuse. I think the answer to that is that that amendment to the Family Law Act, to which he referred earlier this year, provided for mandatory disclosure by court personnel of child sexual abuse, which is the other point he took up today. Under this Bill, approved arbitrators and mediators are included in the definition of `court personnel', and so would be bound to disclose child sexual abuse when it comes to their attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 19c is in identical terms to the section in the Act relating to counsellors. However, there is no question of evidence per se being used in later proceedings. All the mediator can be called on to give evidence about is the fact that he or she did comply with section 73c by notifying the relevant State authorities of the belief that a child had been sexually abused. That section says:</PARA>
<PARA>In so doing the mediator is not breaking confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that to a large extent that probably meets the matter that the honourable member for Kooyong raised. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite outrageous. I do not blame the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for this: it is because of the total mismanagement of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). Accordingly, I will curtail my remarks on the Bill so that others may have a very brief opportunity within the remaining 13 minutes to make a contribution to such a constricted debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On previous occasions I have raised with the Attorney some of the concerns the coalition has with the Proceeds of Crime Act. I will not dwell on those matters today; I simply highlight the fact that some aspects of the Act, as presently drafted, represent a substantial departure from the traditional principles of criminal liability-principles which have taken centuries to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Some illustrations of the novel and somewhat drastic nature of the Act include the reverse onus provisions, whereby it falls upon defendants to establish that their property has not been tainted by illegal activity of any kind, and the fact that the forfeiture powers are not confined to property which, as a matter of fact, can truly be said to represent the proceeds or profits of the relevant crime. </PARA>
<PARA> The concerns I have in the proceeds of crime field ought to be understandable concerns to anyone who is concerned about civil liberties. I say that simply because it really has taken us centuries to develop notions of proper regard for men and women and their role in society, and the state simply cannot override those rights. Notwithstanding the concerns I have with some of the changes that were made by the Proceeds of Crime Act in that sense, I give full support to the underlying premise of the Act; namely, that the financial gains of criminal activity be confiscated so that the incentive to commit crime is reduced. I am in total support of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The outrageous displays of wealth by those who have been found to have engaged in criminal activity have to be punished, and that wealth has to be taken. In the trials of people charged with this criminal activity, I do not want to see any abuse of the processes that respect the rights of individuals. I give total support to the premise of the Act, but we do need to balance against the laudable goal considerations of justice and fairness. The ultimate objective of our criminal justice system is, after all, the protection of individual liberty, and we must never lose sight of that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Fears about the extent of crime in our society-in particular, organised crime-should not always be met with a response which leads to an increase in State powers at the expense of individual liberty. Our response has to be reasoned and careful and, above all, it must be subject to an open discussion and critical examination of the various options that are available. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in putting in place the Proceeds of Crime Act, containing as it does such wide powers of pre-trial seizure and post-trial forfeiture, it falls upon Parliament to ensure that the Act is subject to an ongoing evaluation and that the rights of individuals are not unduly trampled on. Furthermore, we must always be looking for alternative measures to combat crime-by that I mean alternatives to enacting more diverse punishments. In this regard it is pleasing that this Bill that the Attorney has presented, which is under consideration, goes some way towards that, in so far as moneys placed in the trust fund will be used, for example, for drug rehabilitation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends various provisions of the Crimes Act 1914, the Customs Act 1901 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, which deal with the forfeiture of property to the Crown. Clause 19 of the Bill will insert into the Proceeds of Crime Act a new part IIa to provide for the establishment of the confiscated assets trust fund. Moneys realised from the forfeiture of assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act and drug trafficking provisions found in division 3 of part XIII of the Customs Act are to be paid into the trust fund which will be administered by the Official Trustee. Under the relevant provisions of both pieces of legislation, the Official Trustee has responsibility for dealing with property that is the subject of restraining and forfeiture orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The net proceeds from the trust fund are to be distributed as follows: 50 per cent to law enforcement projects and 50 per cent to programs for the rehabilitation of drug users. The crucial provisions in the Bill are found in clause 19 and, in particular, in proposed new section 34d. By proposed new subsection (2) the Attorney-General will be obliged to make an annual determination as to the equal distribution of funds between specific law enforcement projects and drug rehabilitation programs, as selected by the Attorney and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may think that the moneys taken from those who have benefited from crime ought then to be paid into Consolidated Revenue. Many honourable members on my own side do not like these small funds and the like that are out to dollop things. The Government is establishing a trust fund. After paying out to State authorities for moneys raised for their crime, et cetera, the net proceeds go to drug rehabilitation and law enforcement programs. To the extent that the Government is setting up a trust fund, I agree with it; it is laudable then to spend the money on these courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The only problem I have is that there is no specific accountability to the Parliament. The establishment of a trust fund removes from Parliament the responsibility that it has to determine the uses to which the public moneys are put, and that responsibility is reflected in the provisions of the Constitution which confer upon Parliament the power to appropriate public moneys from Consolidated Revenue. Moneys placed in the trust fund will be placed outside the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will confer very wide discretions on the Attorney and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services to decide how the trust funds are to be expended. It may be desirable that determinations made by the Attorney on the allocation of trust funds be set out in written instruments that, in turn, could be tabled in both Houses. Furthermore, it may also be appropriate that such determinations be subject to disallowance or variation by Parliament. But at some point we have to have some parliamentary constraint injected. Because of the time constraints that the Executive has imposed on the House, it will be necessary for the Senate to take up this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues in the other place will give consideration to referring the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with a view to determining whether proposed new section 34d should be amended so that Parliament may have a greater say in the allocation of trust moneys. We have not determined that it will go to that-that will be a matter for those in the other place-but we have said that they should look at the possibility of the Committee examining it. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by emphasising that we support the underlying premise of the Proceeds of Crime Act and the measure under consideration today, but it is imperative that Parliament has a greater role in monitoring the operation of the Act and the expenditure of trust moneys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the limitation of time with respect to the debate on the Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill, I will confine my remarks in the main to the issue of so-called `distributable funds'. The discretion conferred upon the Attorney-General under paragraph 34d (2) (a) of the Bill relates to the distribution of money to fund law enforcement projects. The discretion is not totally unfettered. The funding must be directed toward a project that `promotes the investigation or detection of, or the prosecution of, persons for breaches of Commonwealth criminal law'. In addition, the Attorney is empowered to and will consult with advisory bodies concerned with law enforcement matters on any major decisions. The remarks on proposed new section 34d in the explanatory memorandum refer to the role of the Law Enforcement Policy and Resources Committee in reaching such decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum also makes it clear that the Minister responsible for health matters will consult concerning the distribution of money to drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes. The Minister will consult with the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy on significant decisions. Clearly, it would be undesirable to refer to these ministerial councils in the legislation itself because the name, composition and functions of these councils may well change over time. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that proposed new section 34a provides that the trust fund is a trust account for the purposes of the Audit Act 1901. One consequence of this proposed provision is that there is a reporting requirement pursuant to section 50 of the Audit Act and the Finance regulations. The Department of Finance has issued quite detailed guidelines which apply to the financial statements made under section 50. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 May 1991 the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) issued a joint media release. They stated that the money available for drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes would be targeted at illicit drugs. They also stated that the focus of the money available for law enforcement would be programs which promote the investigation, detection or prosecution of serious criminal offences. Like any new initiative, the effectiveness of the drug fund will be reviewed after a period of operation with a view to correcting any difficulties that may have emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other key points in this Bill. The legislation includes a provision to permit the use of assets seized under the legislation to be directed to law enforcement agencies for operational use. Forfeited property, vehicles and other assets will generally be sold and the profits placed in the trust fund. The legislation even permits the use of confiscated equipment by law enforcement agencies. In this regard, the United States experience in the application of trust funds established under similar legislation has been of assistance in framing this Bill. In the United States the proceeds of sale of forfeited property and forfeited cash are deposited in the asset forfeiture fund. Physical assets may be allocated for official use. The Department of Justice agencies are entitled to share in currency and proceeds of sale. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important initiatives contained in this Bill is the provision to allow property seized from criminals to effect a substantial increase in funds available for law enforcement and drug rehabilitation. That is to say, money available from the trust fund would be in addition to funds normally available as part of the Budget process for law enforcement and drug rehabilitation. This is a major reform. I understand it was opposed in some feckless advice given by the Department of Finance to the Cabinet when this Bill was drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to be congratulated on the introduction of this Bill. I know that the Australian people applaud the legislation as another spike in the coffin of organised crime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Burke for his question. He has raised a very important issue. The honourable member for Blaxland recognised that reducing the inflation rate was a major objective for Australia. To see inflation reduced to sustainably low levels is my objective and that of this Government. The reasons for targeting inflation are quite clear. It is no accident that those countries which have managed to control inflation are those which have performed best over recent years. By cauterising inflation from the economic body in Australia, we establish the basis for the creation of an investment environment which is weighted towards the long term and towards production and which is the basis for sustainable, not illusory, wage outcomes. It gives an automatic advancement in welfare for those on fixed incomes. It gives an automatic increase in competitiveness and further reductions in interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4795" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Prospect for her question, which is timely because the active employment strategy Bill, the social security Bill that would change the nature of benefits and the approach to social security payments for the unemployed, will be implemented on 1 July this year, having just passed through this House of the Parliament. It links the social security payment to the Commonwealth Employment Service, creating structured links between income support, labour market assistance, opportunities and client obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two main thrusts: the increased investment in labour market programs and a new system of payments to replace unemployment benefits-the Job Search allowance and the Newstart allowance. The Job Search allowance will be available for 12 months only. The onus will be clearly on the job seeker to find work through an active and effective job search. The Newstart allowance, for the longer term unemployed, will involve a more comprehensive and intensive process of contact assistance and client obligation. Either payment will continue only if client obligations are met.</PARA>
<PARA> The active employment strategy is a substantial part of this Government's commitment to education, on and off the job training and work experience to maintain and improve the skills that people have in and out of work. The other key element is the training guarantee, a policy initiative of my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Government and employers are working in partnership to pretrain and retrain workers in employment. In terms of this fundamental restructuring of the payment and the link being made between income security and labour market programs, Australia is developing policies that are advanced in terms of the approach to payments in a difficult time of recession and a time in which there is quite high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at what is proposed to be introduced by the Government from 1 July over and against the reaffirmation by Senator Alston of the Opposition's approach in this area-an approach in which the Opposition would, in a sense, seek to mirror the Government. In fact, the Opposition's approach is dictated by a bottom line in terms of Budget results-that is, access to benefits and assistance payments in the end will be arbitrarily determined by a decision that only 50 per cent of those who are out of work after nine months would be eligible for any payment at all. At best, that payment would be the special benefit. Not only will that special benefit type payment approach be linked directly to the unemployed but some kind of work test will be effectively adopted to the range of benefits including, according to Senator Alston, the unemployment benefit, invalid and sole parent pensions and sickness benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, even in a situation where a person is on a sickness benefit and is clearly unable to work because of sickness, apparently the Opposition would apply some test in terms of the person's activity to seek work. That is an absolute contradiction in terms, and reflects an approach by an Opposition that it is not interested in the welfare or the future of those who might be unemployed or those who may be temporarily on social security payments. Simply, it is an approach which would reduce expenditure irrespective of the social consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the issue that is raised, we have on the one hand a policy that is coherent and has been worked through in terms of the links between income security, labour market programs, training and rehabilitation. There is a sense of purpose in terms of the system. On the other hand, we have the negative, punitive kind of approach that Senator Alston is speaking about, which would denigrate, deny and effectively simply seek to save money rather than provide any kind of effective response to those desperately in need through unemployment.</PARA>

As a result of these variations, Australians phoning overseas will save over $6m in a full year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the second part of the question, Mr Speaker: the question of what I bring to this portfolio, given my background, has been alluded to. Let me just go through it because what the honourable member has to understand is my track record of experience. Whilst it is true that the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia was involved in two lengthy wool disputes, it is also true that in winning those disputes we effected significant change in wool stores in this country and acceptance of sale by objective measurement that reduced costs. That is the Storemen and Packers Union connection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, in 1982, when I was still the Secretary of the Storemen and Packers Union, I participated, at the invitation of Peter Nixon, a previous primary industries Minister in this House, in a mission to try to sort out problems associated with the export of live sheep from this country-an area that had been bedevilled by industrial disputation, as the honourable member for Barker would be aware, and which that mission resolved. The honourable member should talk to the industry representatives who went with me on that mission and get from them their view as to my constructive input. He should then come back and talk to me about what I have brought to the resolution of disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> I have read reports in the press about what the honourable member for Barker had to say in respect of the Mudginberri dispute. The reality is that the ACTU never had the Mudginberri dispute until it was a hopeless case. That is correct and the honourable member acknowledges it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I had my first discussion with Jay Pendarvis, I in fact was able to reach an agreement with him that not only would have gained the acceptance of the meatworkers union but would have had the potential to guarantee him an expanded industry base. The people who would not back it were from the National Farmers Federation. They were too far involved in pushing the political issue associated with their fighting fund. I ask the House to reflect on this: is the other side genuinely interested in solving industrial issues that affect their members' interests, including the production process and the supply to the wharf? I am.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker might recall that, as part of our contribution as members of the Rural and Allied Industries Council, to which we were appointed by the Treasurer in his role as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I put the proposition to him in relation to the 4 per cent second tier wage negotiations back in 1986-87 that farmers ought to put pressure on the ACTU-and I said that I would facilitate it-by arguing that that the trade-off for the 4 per cent did not involve work on the farms but guaranteed continuity of supply through the wharves. The honourable member for Barker walked away from it-it was too hard.</PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying is this: in many instances I have been involved in disputes that have affected the farm community. But in all of them I have always put forward a constructive solution. The fact that that has not been able to be realised in all cases has not been my fault. So that is the quality of the position.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the constituency that is represented by the coalition, in particular the National Party of Australia-the constituency, I might add, that I am now proud to represent as Minister-ought to understand that background in assessing whether they should rush to judgment about my capacity to represent them. In all instances, whether it has been in the trade union movement or any other representative role I have had, I have represented my constituency to the best of my capacity and in many cases have won.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the honourable gentleman's question, as those who read our legislation will know, it is our intention to place a price cap on services of 5.5 per cent below the rate of inflation, which will ensure that the Australian telephone consumer will be getting his or her service at a continually falling real price. It also is not our intention to introduce a tax on telephone services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If a 15 per cent consumption tax, for example, were introduced by the Opposition, it would have these effects. Under such a policy, a standard connection fee would increase by $37.95 per subscriber. That is, an Opposition government will tax every Australian $37.95 for the privilege of having a phone connected. The maximum connection fee-and here I address the constituency of my new ministerial colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-for rural and remote area customers will be taxed at a rate of $225.15. This tax will apply to all Australians who have the misfortune of residing further than 16 kilometres from an exchange and who need a telephone.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues opposite in the National Party of Australia would be better placed in asking themselves a few questions about getting some detail out on their taxation proposals instead of bothering the new Minister, who is amply capable of looking after himself. They should go around their constituencies and explain why the Opposition intends to increase that telephone connection fee by $225.15.</PARA>
<PARA> It does not stop there. Business line rentals will have a tax applied of $43.79; residential line rentals will have a tax applied of $23.33. In addition to these not insignificant imposts, every time anyone uses the telephone, be it for business or for social purposes, a coalition proposal will tax them. Local calls will be subject to a 3.6c tax. Community calls used by people in the bush to keep in contact with their local service centre will be taxed 3.6c per three minutes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difference between ordinary Australians and the honourable gentleman is profound, and they are not asking that question at all. To the extent that the honourable gentleman or other honourable members opposite want to address their minds to it, I am more than happy to deal with it. If there is one Prime Minister and one government which have acted in terms of a disastrous impact upon the interests of Ansett TNT, it is this Prime Minister and this Government, because under the Opposition's cosy relationship of the past it kept in existence in this country, at the expense of Australian travellers generally, the two-airline agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two-airline agreement was an arrangement between the two airlines to print money. It was this Prime Minister and this Government which said, `Enough of that cosy agreement; we are bringing to an end the arrangement whereby the Government airline and Ansett, the private airline, can just hold this country to its will and determine what the outcome will be'. It was this Prime Minister, this Government-to the great expense, I may say, of Ansett TNT-which brought that cosy arrangement, the creation and perpetuation of those opposite, to an end.</PARA>
<PARA> I might also refer to the fact that it was this Government which introduced full user pays charging for airport services and refused to let Ansett bid for Australian Airlines Ltd. May I say that it is this Government which has gone about the privatisation of Australian Airlines-something that was within the province of those opposite to do. They never did it. Why did they not do it? Because they had this cosy two-airline agreement, which suited the Government airline and suited Ansett. We have gone about the privatisation of Australian Airlines, obviously in that way giving it a much greater capacity to compete with Ansett. It was this Prime Minister, this Government, that did it-not those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the pilots dispute itself, which those opposite are talking about-what a nice present I gave to Ansett there!-cost it in the order of $100m. But, fortunately for this country, we had a situation where the two airlines-Ansett and Australian Airlines-and this Government were prepared to do what the Opposition did not have the guts to do, and that was to stand up to a murderous claim of 30 per cent by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots right throughout that dispute. Right throughout that dispute, those opposite gave them aid and comfort at every point.</PARA>

It includes a range of proposed measures which would complement the work currently being done by State and local governments. It aims to set targets for reducing waste, such as a 50 per cent reduction in waste going to land fill by the year 2000. It also sets indicative planning targets to be achieved by 1995 for the recycling of major materials including plastics at 25 per cent, currently at 6 per cent; glass at 45 per cent, currently at 36 per cent; paper at 40 per cent, currently at 32 per cent; and aluminium cans at 75 per cent, currently 62 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the advice the Government has received particularly through the Prime Minister's Science Council, because at a discussion that took place last week it estimated that the industry is worth about $4 billion to this country. This is a way we can achieve a very important growth industry for this country, and the Commonwealth is showing a lead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is only part of the strategy. The main thing the Government has done is encourage kids and communities all around Australia working to do something for this country-that is, show by their own example that they can reduce waste in their own homes, can reduce fuel and energy consumption and can make their own personal contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> Today I also announced a number of environment awards, in particular to some schools throughout Australia. I know that children from the Freshwater High School, present in the public gallery today, won a particular award. Many other schools in Australia deserve to be congratulated on their marvellous contribution to the environment. I wish every honourable member and everyone of our generation had made as much contribution as the kids of Australia have.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Don Henry, the Director of the Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia, because today he received the United Nations Environment Program Global 500 award for services to the environment. I thank everybody, both in this House and in the broader community, for their marvellous contribution to World Environment Day, and I hope it continues well after today.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4802" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. In launching my Commonwealth-State initiative in a speech to the National Press Club on 19 July last year, I said that as a nation we must find a better way to integrate the legitimate policy interests of the two major tiers of government-the Commonwealth and the State-and also local government, and to achieve a more integrated and effective delivery of programs and services to Australia's citizens. I said that I believed we should be ready to review all services delivered by the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also made the quite fundamental point, which should be understood, that in all this the Australian Government can never avoid or evade its genuine national responsibilities. The central aim of the Commonwealth-State relations exercise is to work cooperatively with the States to achieve a national approach and agreed national objectives. At the Special Premiers Conference in October last year, heads of government commissioned reviews of a number of functional areas in recognition of the problems that currently exist in part because of duplication and overlap between different levels of government in many service delivery areas. Some of that duplication eats up resources which could go to the needy across a range of services. With cooperation between levels of government, I believe we could free some of those resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government which I have had the pleasure to lead for over eight years now has a very proud record indeed in advancing social justice through protecting the interests of the more disadvantaged members of the community. It is a record which, as my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister said, is now belatedly being recognised by those opposite as they dump their policy of subsidising the wealthy on child-care and have apparently now-at long last-been converted to the idea of means testing. How genuine a conversion this turns out to be remains unknown, as does much of the Opposition's policy until the Leader of the Opposition checks with his party room. It is good to see the Government's policies at last recognised by some honourable members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the States, priority has been given to improving services for groups which include the most disadvantaged-Aborigines, women, the aged, the disabled and the homeless. The next Special Premiers Conference, which is scheduled for July, will consider reports from various working groups established last October with a view to progressing issues through to the November Special Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make this very clear because I know it can be a matter of legitimate concern to many people in the Federal area of government and representation: any agreements or changes to future roles and responsibilities in the Special Premiers Conference context must protect the interests of clients and must clearly specify national interests and set out agreed national objectives. In looking at that, the views of the community will provide an important input to that process. For example, in the community services and health area arrangements have been made with the Australian Council of Social Service to coordinate national consultation with the community welfare sector.</PARA>
<PARA> As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Commonwealth-State Relations, the Deputy Prime Minister will have a role beyond that of his portfolio interest in support of the Special Premiers Conference process. His support for the process has been invaluable in the work that has taken place to date, and he will now be working even more closely with me in the future to achieve these important national objectives.</PARA>

I refer him to his news conference held last Monday, in which he thanked the honourable member for Blaxland for `tremendous service he has given to the Government'. In the light of this statement and other words of praise that the Prime Minister has showered upon the honourable member for Blaxland, why did the Prime Minister instruct his two press secretaries to go out on the eve of the leadership challenge to complain to the media that Keating's poor economic management has not been exposed?

I repudiate the premises of the honourable member's question and invite him to study the whole of the transcript of the interview by John Laws with Senator Richardson.

It has given neither of us little pleasure; but I express the belief that the trauma of that experience gave neither of us pleasure. How could it when we have had such a long, close and productive working relationship. We can have no pleasure out of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the questions that I have answered at this dispatch box in relation to the Australian defence forces have been in relation to their performance in wartime or in war-like situations. Addressing the question asked by the honourable member for Brisbane, in whose electorate some very substantial defence establishments exist, gives me a chance to acknowledge their performance in other respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not come to attention often enough that the Australian defence forces in peacetime carry out some very significant tasks, many of them unsung. They get great publicity during times of flood or emergency and disaster in Australia, when they do an excellent job.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Lions International Convention to which the honourable member refers, that meeting commences in Brisbane in less than a fortnight's time. It is not an ordinary convention because the organisers are expecting in excess of 40,000 visitors from more than 130 countries. As a result of requests from the convention organisers and the Brisbane City Council, it has been decided to provide an Army traffic control unit to organise the movement of 10,000 Lions, of the two-legged variety, to and from the Gold Coast each day. The Army has developed a plan to establish and run a terminal that will facilitate that passenger movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the pretty penetrating comment of the honourable member for Deakin, the plan calls for the coordination of 300 buses, running on 13 routes, delivering passengers to more than 120 destinations from 7.30 in the morning until 11.00 at night. That is similar to moving a force of divisional size, garrisoned over an area the size of Canberra, to and from Goulburn each day. It is on the same scale as the Kangaroo 89 exercise, without the associated costs of troops, transport, fuel, vehicles and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Army will fulfil a very valuable social role by providing defence assistance to the Lions Convention, and it will gain international exposure for its expertise in the very important logistical functions which are so much a part of defence exercises. It is naturally a unique training opportunity in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the honourable member's question, this support for the Lions Convention is just one example of the defence force's assistance to the civil community. We are aware of their work fighting bushfires and floods, providing medivac services in emergencies and last, but, of course, not least, guaranteeing our security. On behalf of the Government, and of the House in general, I wish the Lions Convention well, and I am confident that the Army will do an excellent job in the assistance it is providing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I am aware of the concerns mentioned by him. In addition, he has had a particular interest in this area through the Edwards committee. In order to address those concerns, the advisory committee under the Act will, in conjunction with the Australian Law Reform Commission, be reviewing laws relating to prescribed interests not only in the area of unit trusts but the wider area of prescribed interests, which is an area of particular importance to the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that way, it will bring together the resources of the Law Reform Commission and combine them with the business input of the advisory committee, in order to address what is a very complex area of law and one of great concern to small investors, in particular, and one which is acknowledged as such by the more enlightened of those opposite, such as the honourable member for Higgins. Grave concerns have been expressed about the need for the regulation of unit trusts and prescribed interests generally, and this review, combining business input, will be something that investors and consumers will welcome as a step which should be taken as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members are aware, it is part of an ongoing reform package in this area. We have now put in place a well funded, national regulator in this country. The Government's vision, however, of a better corporate regulation in this country does not end there. We have in place an extensive ongoing program. As honourable members will be aware, the first amendment Bill in the area of consolidation of accounts involves insider trading and, despite some misinformed comment, it will make that area far more effective whilst at the same time striking that difficult balance of ensuring that proper protections are available for accused persons.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to end there, either. The other matters to be dealt with are the Australian company number and the matters arising out of the review in that area, provisions relating to fundraising, and shorter settlement periods for share transfers to enable the stock exchange to improve its efficiency. There is also a third Bill in the area of loans to directors, insolvencies and rights of shareholders.</PARA>

<PARA> The recommendations contained in the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, entitled `Australian Iron and Steel Industry' were considered by the Government in conjunction with the report by the Steel Industry Authority on its review of the Steel Industry Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejected the recommendation of the Standing Committee that secondary dumping be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. Such a reference would not serve any useful purpose. Secondary dumping is almost impossible to prove. In addition, Professor F H Gruen, in his report on his review, in 1986, of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, advised that there are two answers, and only two logical answers, to secondary dumping problems-take duties off inputs or put higher duties on outputs. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these would have limited value in assisting domestic manufacturers of steel-based goods, since their steel inputs are largely Australian made. The second runs counter to the Government's policy of reducing tariff levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also rejected initially the recommendations regarding changes to the Developing Countries preference scheme. However, the Industry Statement of 12 March this year announced that preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea will be phased out from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that the ACTU accept responsibility for overall union commitment to the Steel Plan and act to obtain greater commitment by workers at the shop floor level. I am pleased to record that progress has been made on a comprehensive series of agreements between BHP and the unions concerned. National agreements with the individual unions will form the basis for local agreements at each of the three steelmaking plants. Some of these agreements have been ratified at all levels, and others are well advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> These agreements provide for continuing improvements in productivity, security of employment, changes in work practices and ongoing training programs for employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that, if a new voluntary restraint agreement on steel exports to the United States is unavoidable then an increase in the tonnage allowed into the American market be negotiated. This was achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House now has a good opportunity to look at eight years of the Hawke-Keating Government. Now that the deputy prime ministership has passed onto somebody else, now that the treasurership has passed on to somebody else, we can have a long, hard look at just what this Government has delivered for Australia and Australians over eight years. One would have to say by way of overall summary that this has been a government of deals and of deception. It is a partnership that began with deals and deception with the overthrow of Mr Hayden. It has continued for eight years on the basis of deals and deception and, ironically for the two players, it has ended with the partners deceiving each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that they deceived each other, whilst in itself utterly disgraceful, is nowhere near as disgraceful as the fact that people holding positions of high trust-as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) did-deceived the Australian public. It is utterly appalling that in the process of dealing and deceiving each other they perpetrated one of the most outrageous deceptions on the Australian public that we have ever seen in political life. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us understand that this is not the normal stuff of politics. It is not sufficient for people such as Senator Button to brush this aside as the sort of thing that happens in elections. It is not a case of overoptimism; it is not a case of gilding the lily in an election campaign; it is not even a case of avoiding an issue. It was a case of cold, calculated deception. It was also a cold, calculated conspiracy, solemnly witnessed, because the conspirators did not even trust each other. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I want to examine a small part of the history of the deals and deceptions of the Hawke-Keating Government. I mention both principal players because they jointly bear responsibility for the disastrous consequences of their Government's actions. There is a tendency in the press gallery to give hero status to the honourable member for Blaxland. I say to the House that those values are false values. They are the kinds of values that would honour Ned Kelly above the people he robbed and the policemen he killed. These two men have wrought destruction not only on the honour of their positions and on the Party they have led, but also on the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent Australians. Theirs is a history of deals, deception and destruction-deals with mates, deals with unions, deals with vested interests, deals with each other, deals to secure benefits for particular sections of the community at the expense of the ordinary citizen and taxpayer. Most of these deals involved deception, either of the people or the parties to the deal, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> I have time to look at only two examples of disastrous and deceitful deals. My colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) will look at others relating particularly to the environment and rural industries. The first and biggest deal, and the overarching policy direction of the Government, was the accord. The Government went into office on the basis of the accord, but even before that the present Prime Minister went into the leadership of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) on the basis of the accord. It was a deal between the present Prime Minister and his trade union mates. It was a deal withheld by those mates from Mr Hayden as part of the deceitful process that led to the displacement of Mr Hayden by the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This deal was rooted in deceit and dishonesty. It would be improper for me to speculate on His Excellency's thoughts on this matter today, so I will not speculate. But under that deal the mates were promised influence. They were promised access to the innermost councils of the Government. Every important decision of the Government would be discussed beforehand with those mates. Crean and Kelty would be de facto Cabinet Ministers-not only ordinary Cabinet Ministers but Cabinet Ministers with a special introduction into the higher levels of the Government. So the mates were promised influence. </PARA>
<PARA> The people were promised jobs. They were promised higher wages. They were promised better conditions. Employers were promised profits. Small business was promised good conditions for expansion. The farmers were promised an end to the drought. Australians overall were promised prosperity under the accord. The accord led immediately-and it is worth looking back over the years at this-to one of the biggest spending binges by government in Australia's history. The first two Keating Budgets spent on a Whitlamesque scale, and in that spending of the first two years was laid the whole basis of the expansion of our foreign debt. The jobs that were created were bought with borrowed money; they were promised falsely; they were delivered on a false basis; and we now know that they could not be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> What have the Australian people got out of the accord? It is quite clear now what they have got out of the accord. First of all, they have lost their jobs. All those jobs that were bought on borrowed money are disappearing hour by hour, day by day. The Government has admitted that the number of jobless is going to be higher than in the 1982-83 recession. We now know that the situation is going to be the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian workers have lost out on real wage increases. This Labor Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland, as Treasurer, day after day have boasted in this House that the great Australian Labor Party has reduced the real wages of workers and increased the profit share. Day after day after day, they have boasted that the Labor Party is proud of the fact that it has reduced workers' real wages and reduced their living conditions; and they have said that the profit share has gone up and that is good because it will lead to investments and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened? Of course, people have not kept those jobs. They have lost the wages. If we look at the last quarter's profit figures, we find that profits decreased by 29 per cent. So they have not even kept the promise as to increasing profits and at the same time they have screwed down the workers by maintaining a nonsensical wage fixation system that pays the least able and the least ready worker the same as the best worker, the person who really wants to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, during this time small business has been decimated. Bankruptcies since last year are up 54 per cent. Farmers are being driven off the land; at least 25 to 30 per cent of farmers are terrified as to whether they will be able to maintain their properties. We have had the worst situation on the land that anybody can remember. Of course, as I said, business profits, which are supposed to be the basis of this investment for new jobs, have now collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland have day by day boasted of pushing up business profits at the expense of wages, an inevitable outcome of the zero sum game that is their economy, but even big business has been deceived because of the reduction in profits. The great deal of the accord has delivered only to the mates: Crean is in the Cabinet; Kelty may as well be in the Cabinet; I do not know about the new fellow, I do not know whether they have let him into the Cabinet-but Kelty is certainly still there. Kelty is also in Kirribilli House and party to the innermost Cabinet decisions. However, it was and, of course, always would be disastrous for workers without jobs, for small businesses bankrupted, for farmers losing their farms and for families struggling to pay the bills. </PARA>
<PARA> All these people were deceived as to the promised benefits of the deal that bestowed the crown on the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and put the honourable member for Blaxland into a position of high influence. But uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, and that leads us to the most extraordinary deal of all: the Kirribilli House conspiracy. Surely this is the ultimate deal-trading in the prime ministership. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to observe the mores of the ALP at work. Keating is a creature of Sussex Street, of the New South Wales thuggish right wing; ask His Excellency about that. The origin of this deal was in the spoils system of the ALP: `I ought to have my turn. I've been a ward-heeler. I've been a union delegate. I've been an official in the Sussex Street gang. I've been a backbencher, a shadow Minister, and a Minister. And it is my turn. If you don't give me my turn, I'll pull the plug on you'. The Prime Minister, Old Jellyback, was so scared of this threat that he was going to have the plug pulled on him by this person who was beside him--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the term and refer to him as the honourable member for Wills. But he simply did not have the guts to stand up to the honourable member for Blaxland and call his bluff. So they agreed to have this deal but, not trusting each other, they had to have outside witnesses, thus giving an extraordinary hostage to fortune. Either of those witnesses could have pulled the plug on them, and we only have to think of the possible consequences for public policy of that threat being held over the heads of the two principal participants, both of whom were party to the deception in the forthcoming election. So they solemnly decided between themselves to deceive the Australian public and they gave a hostage to fortune. These two people agreed to a cold and calculated act of deception-surely the ultimate deal and the ultimate deception, a deception on the Australian political body and on the Australian public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole political system in Australia depends very much on people's personal sets of values-the kind of restraint that they automatically impose upon themselves. No written rules can dictate what people are going to do all the time. They have to have an innate sense of value. They have to have an innate sense of what democracy is all about. If they are in high office, they have a responsibility which goes beyond that of the ordinary citizen. Most things they do are subject to scrutiny. But inevitably in public life, there are all sorts of things they do which are not subject to immediate scrutiny. It is those things and the way people handle those issues and make those decisions which set the whole tone of public life. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know, disgracefully, that the two highest people in the land sat down at a meeting in Sydney with two outsiders, just a few years ago, and traded in the future of the prime ministership of Australia. That tells us something about the morality of this Government. It tells us that it is a government of deals and deception. Those deals and that deception have led to the destruction of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. It is time both of these people were swept from public life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) never speaks insincerely; he always believes what he says. What he can never do, however, is see the faults in his own side and himself. He can see the faults in the Opposition or what he believes to be the faults in the Opposition-and that has been a common failing of all those associated with the New South Wales organisation of the Liberal Party and all those brought up in the Liberal Party in New South Wales during the Askin era of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a relevant consideration in this debate because, when we are debating a matter like this, we debate it not only in the abstract, on a theory of how government operates, but also in the sense of ourselves compared to somebody else, because that is what politics is about in this country. There is a government and there is a opposition. When those in the Opposition come to attack the Government, they come from a particular background, just as in the same way, when the Government attacks the Opposition or defends itself, it carries its own baggage with it-and nobody can deny that. That is why in this place, when we get the sort of unctuous nonsense that we have had from the other side of the House on this matter, it is galling to the point that nobody outside this place need take note of it-nor do they take note of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will get to deal with both the honourable gentleman's points eventually. That so-called wages deal, the accord, produced for the work force of this country well over a million jobs, very few of which have been lost in the context of this period of recession. It was a deal from which the ordinary Australian benefited very substantially. If the Opposition wages policy had applied, as it wished it to, during the pilots dispute, we would not be talking around here about 10 per cent or 11 per cent unemployment levels; we would be talking about an absolutely massive unemployment number-an extraordinary difficulty for our people. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I get to talking about the accord, which is an honourable part of public policy, I will talk about the deals and the cloak of honesty which, unctuously, the honourable member for Mackellar chose to clothe himself in. Let me read some quotes from the last leadership challenge in the Liberal Party two years ago by the person who was the loser in that case, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), on Four Corners. These are his own words:</PARA>
<PARA>Those who boasted about their proficiency in telling lies, in practising treachery, have done the Liberal Party an enormous disservice, an enormous disservice. There is a place for some honour in a political party . . . If those people who shared my political confidences felt I was unfit, they should, in honour, have resigned from the Shadow Ministry and, from outside the Shadow Ministry, worked to bring about a change of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> That would have been an honourable thing to do . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . .</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Peter Shack, for example, made a fetish during the weeks that led up to it of actually coming to me and saying `John, you know I've always been a supporter of Andrew's, but that is now a thing of the past. We're all getting behind you. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere, he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you accept Andrew Peacock's denials; his claim that he knew nothing about this until the weekend; that he was simply drafted?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't believe that in the face of what transpired on Monday night and what I know . . . I cannot believe in all my heart that he was not privy to the detail of that. </PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>So you believe he has lied?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, somebody is not telling the truth . . . You can't have gone into that kind of detail and then expect people to believe that suddenly people came along and tapped you on the shoulder and said, `Hey chum, we'd like you to be leader'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Michael Baume then said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a simple question. One has to decide who is lying-John Moore and Wilson Tuckey or Andrew Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the participants in that series of incidents just two years ago, the same time span that the next election is away from us-a piece of recent political history in which the bulk of the front bench of the leadership of the Liberal Party was involved-were involved in a tale of lies, deceit, deceptions, deals and all the rest of it. Do not come into this place and try to kid us that that is not the stuff of politics on the other side of the House. By all means, those opposite can kid themselves, but they should not try to kid us. Do not try to debase the operations of democratic politics, which will involve invariably a series of arrangements made around the place in leadership ballots or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> For those opposite to say that no leader of the Liberal Party has ever been elected or has maintained his position without entering into some arrangement at some point of time with some of his colleagues would be like coming into this place and displaying a level of gormlessness which in itself would make them unfit for government. If they are that gormless in relation to their colleagues, then they are not sensible enough to be able to deal with the Public Service in a ministerial position, or sensible enough to deal with their colleagues in Cabinet, or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks about deals. The deal that we are alleged to have made in regard to the wages accord created in this country over 1 1/2 million jobs. It created a rate of employment growth twice the average of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and about four times the average of when those opposite were in office. It will take a heck of a long recession, a length of time that will not occur, before the bulk of the benefits of those jobs, in comparison to what those opposite achieved, will be washed away. The effect that had, of course, was to ensure that there were opportunities for people in this country which were not there when the Opposition was in office.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that when those opposite talk `deal' in regard to the trade unions they have never understood the situation of the trade unions in relation to the totality of the people in this country. The Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party collectively, in terms of direct membership, represent something like 2 per cent of the Australian community. If the Opposition numbers and our numbers were totted up, we collectively in the political process represent about 2 per cent of the Australian community. If members of the union movement and the people in the electorate who are married to them, or those people who are in some way associated with them, are totted up we are talking about closer to 20 or 30 per cent of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Kelty does not come into the Government and say, `How about a nice fat cheque for the building that I have just invested in; how about taking capital gains tax off my building so that I can make a substantial sum of money?'. Bill Kelty earns the average Australian Council of Trade Unions level of wages, which I think is about 50 grand a year. It is a heck of a lot less than any of the crew on the other side of the House. </PARA>

That is what the honourable member is talking about. But who is he acting on behalf of? The people he is acting on behalf of are the ordinary wage and salary earners of this country, their children and their employment opportunities, and that deal is massively delivered. Failure by Thatcher to achieve a wages accord, failure by Thatcher to establish some degree of control over that very important tool of economic management-the wages outcome-has put her Government in a situation now where it faces endless inflationary wage claims and it will have to pay them, like the Opposition did when it was in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition was getting out of the trade union movement a level of wage claim which was economically unsustainable for the country, which put us in a position where we lost all productivity and which put us in a position where we lost all competitiveness.

<PARA> The other bogus part of the argument, the deeply dishonest part of the argument, of the honourable member for Mackellar-he is not without economic knowledge and, therefore, the depth of the dishonesty of his argument comes from the basis of his knowledge in that regard-goes to the levels of deficit experienced by this Government in its first two years in office. He suggested that part of the wages accord that was reached with the trade union movement in some way related to government expenditures. What a load of nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time, in any piece of political analysis or economic analysis anywhere around this country, that I have seen anything which suggests that at any time there was any element of public outlays in those two years associated with the deficits which occurred that were in some way or other associated with the accord. That is just stand-up, palpable and disgraceful nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know, however, where the first of those deficits came from. It sat there-from Mr Stone, the then Secretary of the Treasury-to be presented to the returning Liberal Government, during which time he was told that its outlays had expanded to a point where it could anticipate something like a $10 billion deficit. That was the first of the two deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite true that in ramping back that deficit we had to produce two extraordinarily difficult deficit outcomes. The cost of not producing two extraordinarily difficult deficit outcomes would not have been a cost borne by Mr Kelty, a cost borne by the members of the Liberal Party who were then still in Parliament, or a cost borne by its particular mates in business or whatever. It would have been a cost borne by the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Just imagine if we had decided to ramp back that $10 million deficit in the space of 12 months. What a bonzer life that would have been for the average Australian pensioner. The sum of $10 billion can be extracted from a Budget, if one really tries, but it can never be got out of a Budget unless the very heart of the social security aspects are attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> When attempting to engage in debate on a serious matter of public policy, there is always a sensible and legitimate economic argument-and I am always prepared to argue with the Liberal Party on the issue of whether or not there ought to be forms of wages controls or accords-which says that the labour market ought to find its own level as every other section of the market. That is an area for sensible, decent and economic debate between any sides in politics. There is no denying that we take one view and the Opposition takes another. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a nonsense to criticise that central element of public policy which has been an issue for governments that predated this one, including the coalition Government with its own legislative wage freeze after the consequences of its own unmitigated wage rises. It went from one extreme to the other. When it confronted that situation it was not because of deals but because of a debate on public policy. When the Opposition moves these semi-censure motions or censure motions, it destroys and bowdlerises the decent terminology and discourse of political debate by trying to degrade a serious debate on public policy down to a question of deals. The fatuous position adopted by the honourable member for Mackellar, which made up something like two-thirds of his speech, ought to be dismissed for the complete nonsense that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if we want to go round the place arguing about who makes deals and who does not, or who does things for people in this place that elevate their interests and who does not, we can do no better than go to the Opposition's present central position on taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The people whom Bill Kelty represents, as a leader of the trade union movement, and whom many others represent, are the ordinary Australians. The trade union movement has always been a collection of its individual parts; it has never been centralised in its directorship. Although responsibility has been handed up the line, it operates through processes at least as democratic as anything that the Liberal Party can throw up. The central element of the unions' charter is not to make money for themselves-and they do not. On the whole, union officials die poor men, and when they die poor men, they have only this to look back on: whether or not they have served the interests of their members, who constitute the vast majority of ordinary working Australians, and secured things for them. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition offer these people against our so-called deal as far as wages policy is concerned? It says to them, `Listen, you can pay a 15 per cent consumption tax on your food, your clothing-everything that goes to producing your children, to bringing them up, to giving them an education, to allowing them to get themselves around the State and around the city, to getting themselves employed and to getting on the telephone. We will put a tax on you'. Who will benefit? None of them will benefit in terms of a direct trade-off with any tax cuts unless it goes well above a 15 per cent value-added tax or goods and services tax, or whatever it is that the Opposition cares to call it. But we do know one group that will benefit: it will be everybody who speculated in property in the 1980s and still maintain their assets. </PARA>
<PARA> In most areas of the community these people have come to be loathed over the last few years. And what is the Liberal Party policy for them? They will be able to maintain the profit of their speculation, and the achievement of that will be at the expense of the ordinary citizen, the ordinary person on whose behalf these `deals', as the Opposition puts it, were done. Some deal from the Opposition! I say: some nonsense from the Opposition; some unctuous, self-righteous baloney from the Opposition in this debate! No wonder it has put up wet-lettuce type arguments to defend itself on a Wednesday afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard an excited speech by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). I remind him that essentially we are talking about integrity and credibility. If he wants an example of misleading the Australian people, I refer him to a quote of his own from the 7.30 Report on 10 September last year. In answer to a question, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I think there is a great deal of respect for Paul (Keating) and the Party and I have a great deal of respect for him and as I have said before in the distant future when the leadership emerges, I will be voting for him. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that highlights that this Government, since March 1983 when it assumed power, has been heavily involved in deals and in deception to the detriment of the Australian people. That is the theme of this matter of public importance today: to the detriment of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made a personal commitment to elevating special favours and secret deals to an art form, in his desperate attempt to cling on as leader. He has anointed himself, in effect, as the high priest of dealership so that he can continue to fall over the line at election time. He has indulged in such questionable trickery as blatantly buying the voting patronage of minority groups with taxpayers' money. I think a great example of that is the millions of taxpayers' dollars that the Government has given the trade unions since it came to power. These are just the headings. It goes on for page after page in Hansard, running into many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has indulged in special favours, such as for the Green movement in Australia, in an attempt to buy votes. I will return to that in a moment. It has also indulged in cruel promises to a trusting public-promises that it had no intention of ever honouring. Honourable members will remember the Prime Minister saying, `There will be no capital gains tax'; they will remember well the Prime Minister saying, `By 1990 no child will live in poverty', and that sort of nonsense. Those were promises that the Government had no intention of honouring; that it could not have honoured; that it knew it could not honour; but that it made to deceive the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think so. The list of deals that the Government has done is mind-boggling. I repeat that it is all to the detriment of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today in Question Time the Prime Minister raised the matter of the pilots strike. I guess we will never fully know the deal that was done there. When that pilots strike was on, the Prime Minister had the choice to side with Abeles or with the pilots. He chose to side with Peter Abeles. He may have been right or he may have been wrong, but as an Australian I would like to think that he sided with Abeles for the correct reason. It was well known that Abeles wanted to get rid of his surplus pilots, it is well known that the Prime Minister is a mate of Abeles-he admits it and reinforces it every day in the House-and it is well known that Abeles has granted the Prime Minister several favours. It makes one wonder. When the Prime Minister will go back on what I would have thought was a lifelong principle to stoop to the level of bringing in overseas labour-foreign pilots-to break that strike, it makes one question what sort of a deal was struck. The relationship continues even today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) talk about the Kirribilli secret deal-a secret which, if it had got out, would have cost the Prime Minister an election. What power the Prime Minister put in Abeles' hands on that occasion! Let me list a few more deals. Look at Coronation Hill. We all remember that famous telephone chat with the Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), Phillip Toyne. </PARA>
<PARA> Coronation Hill is an area that has been heavily prospected; 12 old mine sites were worked over in the 1950s and 1960s. Coronation Hill itself was worked without Bula being disturbed in any way. As much as 1.2 million ounces of gold has been proven up there. It has platinum and palladium-anti-greenhouse minerals-waiting for the taking. We know that it would earn $500m in export income and $200m in profit for this country. It would employ 630 people, perhaps for 20 years, including Aboriginal people, thereby giving them a great opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> BHP Gold and the other joint venture partners spent $13m on exploration and development plans for the area. In September 1987 Senator Richardson virtually gave them the nod to go ahead. The Prime Minister, in effect, did the same thing one month later. Then Phillip Toyne from the ACF rang the Prime Minister and spoke to him for 90 minutes. As a result of that, the Prime Minister put it on the back burner. When Sir Arvi Parbo, the Chairman of BHP, a great Australian chairing Australia's largest company, which produces millions of dollars of taxpayers money every year in the taxes that it pays, rings the Prime Minister to put his case, his side of the story-surely not an unreasonable request-the Prime Minister refuses to even take the call. He would not even listen to him, because of this deal that he had struck with Phillip Toyne in an attempt to get preferences. It is sickening indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> We only have to look at what has happened in uranium mining where we have this ridiculous three-mines policy, now a two-mines policy. A deal was done with the Prime Minister to placate the internal factions of the Labor Party. That is not in the interests of Australia. At this very moment the Prime Minister is trying to ensure that this topic is not even debated at the Labor conference this month. If that comes to pass, it will mean that it will not even be debated, let alone changed, until the next conference, which is due in 1993. As there is an election due in that year, it will not come in until 1994. That will be too late for the mines presently waiting for approval, including Jabiluka, Kintyre, Koongara, Yeelirie, et cetera. The contracts for that uranium will probably be written for the Canadians. I think that almost borders on treason. </PARA>
<PARA> For a few grubby votes the Prime Minister has sold out Australia again to stitch up some sort of deal to try to placate the factions in the Labor Party so that he can have the left wing vote should some leadership challenge emerge, which it has this week. We all saw how much he depended on the left wing votes. That is what is going on in Australia today. That is what the Australian people should know about. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the issue of the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The Prime Minister is paralysed to show any leadership at all. He cannot make a decision, except to make no decision. The interests of Australia again are put aside. As far as the Government is concerned, that is a secondary consideration. It says, `Forget about Australia; let's think of a couple of marginal seats or some people who might vote for me that I might offend'. It is incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will remember what happened with regard to Wesley Vale. The Prime Minister and Senator Button gave the go-ahead in October 1988. As a result, North Broken Hill and Noranda spent $20m on development there. Then the greens got into the Prime Minister again, Richardson stitched up a deal to ensure the preference votes went to the Labor Party at the next election in the distant cities of Sydney and Melbourne, Wesley Vale was put on the back burner; it was ditched in May 1989 and the biggest commercial manufacturing investment in Australia's history was put aside. Four hundred jobs in the mill and 1,200 jobs outside the mill were put aside so that the Prime Minister could stitch up yet another deal for a few grubby votes. Forget about Australia-that is the Prime Minister's motto. </PARA>

It not only sent a cheque for just under $1m to the wrong mill but it sent it to the wrong town. It was even sent to the wrong State. That is how incompetent and indifferent the Government is to the real workers, the wealth creators, of this country.

At 9.30 on Sunday evening on 7 May 1989 he, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition-he vowed loyalty to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-along with the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), went to the office of their leader. After all, Leaders of the Opposition are alternative Prime Ministers; they are officers of this Parliament.

It was not until 8.30 p.m. on 8 May, the very next night, that these men of principle, these men of honour, went to their leader and said, `We're going to spill you tomorrow morning'.

<PARA>PAUL LYNEHAM: What about Fred Chaney, what was your feeling when you saw him there?</PARA>
<PARA>JOHN HOWARD: I think we might terminate the conversation. </PARA>
<PARA>JEFF McMULLAN: Was it Fred Chaney's ambition that led to this onslaught?</PARA>
<PARA>JOHN HOWARD: I think he failed the basic test of honour and that is of warning, and I don't object to people changing their mind about you as a leader, but when they are in a special position of trust, they have an obligation of candour and warning. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the honourable member for Mackellar: was his name one of the 25? Was he one of the 40? Had he been approached or did he know nothing about it? Where are all these men of honour who now come into this House, having stabbed their own leader in the back and who now want to lecture us about principles and honour?</PARA>
<PARA> After the last election none of these people could stand recycling as leader, so what did the smart advertising men of the Liberal Party do? The advertising agency said, `Look, you've got to get somebody who doesn't look like a politician and who doesn't think like a politician'. For the first time in the history of Australia we have a Leader of the Opposition who wanders around Australia saying, `I'm not really a politician; I'm just the Leader of the Opposition'. That is a very useful exercise for the honourable gentleman because he promises the people of Australia a consumption tax and when he is asked questions about it, he says, `Goodness me, don't you mind about that; I'm not really a politician'. When he is asked about his promises of vouchers for education and health and the dismantling of Medibank, a cut of $3 billion, he says, `Don't ask me about that; I'm not really a politician'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the people who come in here and talk about honour. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), a new boy, was a solicitor who acted for the Liberal Party establishment in a range of land deals in the Frankston Mornington Peninsula in which their supporters were involved. He would be the first lawyer in the history of Parliament to come into this place not on the basis of what he knows but on the basis of what he had promised to forget. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), a man of honour and principle. He has never heard of the Bjelke-Petersen trust fund. I say to the honourable gentleman that he has a great distinction in Australian history: he is the first Leader of the National Party in Australia who has more ex-Ministers of his Party in gaol than he has sitting in a Cabinet-and he does not even have the decency to send them a bunch of flowers and suggest that they form the Boggo Road branch of the National Party. He should not come in here lecturing us about ethics and morality. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the same old sordid bunch. The reason he was picked as Leader is that nobody would have believed it if they had said of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that he did not know about it. At least he would have had the courage and capacity to stand up. But the Leader of the National Party comes in here and says, `Oh no, the Bjelke-Petersen trust fund would never have been used for Federal purposes'. </PARA>
<PARA> He would have to be the only person in Australia who believes that it is possible to wander in to see the Premier of Queensland, not have to sign a book, be checked out by security, and leave $600,000 without anybody knowing who left it. Dear me! What sort of party do we have? Do honourable members opposite believe that those funds were never called for or applied for in a Federal election? I say to the Leader of the National Party: where is the speech that he has made in this House condemning the tactics and the deals made day after day by his political cohorts in Queensland and recently in New South Wales? He knows nothing about honour and morality. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have done with the whinnying and the whining. It is time the Opposition started to address the real issues that confront this nation. The Opposition has failed. It has a trendy gentleman who runs into Parliament every morning, trying to look good and saying, `I am an athlete; I am an ex-economist; but I am not a politician. Don't ask me any of those difficult political questions. I will put up the honourable member for Mackellar to talk with sincerity and principle about honour and candour'. </PARA>
<PARA> When honourable members opposite have the guts to admit that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), one of the distinguished parliamentarians of this House, was treated with grave dishonour and was the subject of a sordid political ambush, with the people involved now sitting on the front bench, they can come to us and talk about honour and principle. Perhaps then we will listen. Until they do that, I advise them to get on and deal with the real issues in the economy, the real problems that face the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to stand up here and spell out the details of his policy, instead of slinking away, going to any little meeting he can go to, and saying, `Don't ask me the hard questions. I can tell you what I am going to do: support a free market economy and kick the trade union movement to death. Although it has not worked in America and not worked in England, and it will not work here, don't ask me for details; I'm not a politician'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Quarantine Act 1908 provides that the expense of keeping goods in quarantine for the time necessary to be assured that the risk of diseases and pests is minimal is a legal charge against the goods. However, it is not clear, if the payment is not made, whether the goods can be sold to recoup the costs or whether they must be surrendered to their owners. The Bill before us remedies this uncertainty. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his second reading speech gives an example of a recent case where valuable animals had undergone extensive quarantining but had to be released with the owner owing the Commonwealth $1.5m. The Commonwealth is now suing for recovery, with little likelihood of recovering the full amount. Another example quoted involved a program where a large number of animals were held in quarantine for many years to address the risk of scrapie. That is coming to an end early next year. While the Commonwealth claims that it has subsidised the seven-year care of these animals, charges will be up to $900,000 and the importers have disputed the outstanding debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill gives the Commonwealth the power to hold the goods until payment, or an arrangement for payment, has been made. If this does not apply, the Bill gives the Commonwealth power to sell the goods and apply the proceeds of sale to the debt owing to the Commonwealth. `Goods' is rather a loose term because we are really talking about genetic material of animals, plants or embryos coming into Australia and undergoing the necessary time in a quarantine station to ensure that no diseases enter the country with a particular animal or plant. </PARA>
<PARA> To protect the rights of the owners under the new arrangement, the Commonwealth must serve notice advising that if at the end of 30 days any expenses relating to quarantine are still outstanding the goods may be sold. The Opposition supports this legislation. However, I am concerned that the balance between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and the client may now move too much to the Government and away from the client. For example, I am advised that, in the scrapie issue, the client believes that the $900,000 charges are not fair or reasonable. There is no appeal mechanism to determine this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I put a serious question to the new Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free). I congratulate him on his appointment, and I hope he can start off well by giving me an answer to this question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily immediately, but I do not want him to quarantine it for too long. There is a need for some mechanism for a client facing the loss of goods or material to have an arbitration ability, to challenge whether or not it is a fair or reasonable cost, short of an actual legal challenge. I believe that is a reasonable question which I hope will be passed on to the appropriate Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This raises the related issue of AQIS and its role generally. I am not talking about export inspection services today, but I do want to commend AQIS for the increased capacity that has now been made available in Australia for people to import the new genetic material-mainly animal-that this country needs if its livestock industries are to maximise their potential. One thinks of a whole range of animals. For example, sheep from the continent of Europe, where scrapie is a problem, have high fertility and are very good meat producing animals. The genetic material, the embryos, et cetera, for the development of the best angora goats in the world comes from South Africa and neighbouring countries. There are certain types of sheep that can withstand more tropical climates. We have some cattle from Kenya and Zimbabwe at the present time in that category. They can withstand the tropical climate better than other breeds we may have currently. There is tremendous scope to increase our plant and livestock production in this country with a quarantine system that has the capacity to handle it, and I commend AQIS for what has been happening in recent years in that regard and for its technical ability to cover against disease. </PARA>
<PARA> In this quarantine area, AQIS has a very important dual role. First, there is the role I have been referring to-that is, quarantine on imports. There are two types of imports: there are particular animals or plants for breeding purposes-which I have been referring to-and there are the goods, mainly horticultural goods such as fruit, which come here in bulk as consumer items, which AQIS must make sure are free of disease. I have been critical of AQIS in the past with regard to this. I believe AQIS has a very critical role in ensuring that the relatively disease-free status of our animal and plant industries in Australia is not put at risk by less than adequate quarantine procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another role, and that relates to the export of plants and animals from Australia. Importing countries may require certain standards, for example, with meat or horticulture. In relation to exports, I believe that AQIS is moving in the right direction, to more self-regulation-apart from where a certain country may require government confirmation of particular standards-but I would dispute that it is moving at an adequate speed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a final area-that is, gaining access to our exports by the consumers of other countries where there is a quarantine problem at the importing end. If one wants to talk about politics or trade restrictions and quarantine, Australia is a very fair country-sometimes I think it is too fair-when we compare it with other countries and the way they play the game. I believe that we need to maintain political pressure on those countries. I know that is not the role of AQIS, but there is a technical role for an AQIS; sometimes the country needs to be convinced that we have got all of the technological answers that are necessary or we need technical information to assist our exporters to gain access to those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in this final area there is a very important role for AQIS-one in which presumably at the present time AQIS is not being encouraged or given adequate facilities to provide the maximum support that could be given. I recommend an expanded role for AQIS in the future, particularly in relation to our potential horticultural exports and access to certain countries in Asia. I think in particular of Japan, but it certainly is not the only relevant country. As I said earlier, the coalition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objective of the Quarantine Amendment Bill is to strengthen the ability of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to recover debts from commercial importers. The amendments will apply to all imported goods, animals and plants, but I must stress that importers of family pets and one-off imports are not usually a problem in relation to payment for quarantine services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the existing Quarantine Act 1908, once the period of quarantine has expired the animals must be released to the importer or owner. This resulted in a loss of some $1.5m in revenue from the use of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands by the Boran-Tuli syndicate, which had 80 head of cattle released before paying its outstanding debt. The amendment is designed to prevent such losses in the future and, of course, to give AQIS a stronger bargaining position. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, there has been a trend towards larger scale importation of animals to bolster the gene pool of or introduce new species to Australian agriculture. For instance, the Spotswood quarantine station in Victoria has some 150 head of cattle at any one time; the Cocos (Keeling) Islands station has been used for large herds of alpacas; birds are imported in commercial consignments of flocks of up to some 400 at a time; and deer herds of 20 to 40 animals are imported. This has led to AQIS entering into arrangements with the private sector to run its own quarantine stations under AQIS supervision and subject to quarantine law at Terraweena in South Australia, Wongan Hills in Western Australia, Glendook in Victoria and Kirra in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this has also led to the accumulation of higher debts. For example, the accumulated debt for animals held at the Torrens Island quarantine station between 1986 and 1991 is about $750,000. On top of this, the charges levied do not recover the true cost of the services, so in effect the importer using Torrens Island has received a subsidy of about $1.1m over the quarantine period. That is certainly not good enough. This is only one example; similar considerations apply at other quarantine stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Animals subject to scrapie freedom assurance programs are kept at Torrens Island and the private quarantine stations. Scrapie is a transmissible sub-viral biological agent, with incubation periods usually ranging from two to five years, and it affects sheep and goats. There is no known test to detect carrier animals and for this reason it is necessary to quarantine imported sheep and goats for a period of years. </PARA>
<PARA> One can imagine the accumulation effect of costs. In addition, progeny of imported sheep and goats are quarantined for more than one generation. The animals involved in this program are quarantined at various places throughout Australia and have attracted substantial, highly subsidised charges of up to $900,000 for services provided by the Commonwealth in ensuring that the animals are free from disease and may be released for breeding purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in the Bill, allowing the Commonwealth to retain possession of the animals, will ensure that the Commonwealth's bargaining position over payment of the debt is not weakened. However, the amendments will apply to any goods undergoing quarantine, both now and in the future, not just the animals in the scrapie freedom assurance program. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made a very valid point when he explained the quarantine standards in other countries. Certainly, there is some suspicion that some countries use quarantine as a form of tariff barrier. Australia is extremely fair and sensible and again, when it comes to trade, Australia leads the way. If we have to continue to raise these matters and shame the rest of the world, we will do so. I concede that the honourable member for Murray and I have had the privilege of working together on that matter. On that basis we often come to agreement that we are sick and tired of seeing the European cowards hiding behind high trade barriers-whether they use quarantine or whether they use subsidies, as at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity for export exists for Australian horticulture, in particular. I have a very strong interest in that, having the biggest and best electorate for horticulture in Australia. The potential export of cucurbits and tomatoes to New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong opens up a massive opportunity because, unfortunately, we are now flooding our domestic market. We have only 17 million Australians, and the market is very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Fast food takeaways are often substituted for the traditional type of family meal. This occurs for different reasons, such as social or sporting reasons or the fact that a lot of families have mum and dad working and, consequently, there is a lot of competition as to whether potatoes and tomatoes are put on the plate or whether the family has a pizza or Kentucky fried chicken. Therefore, we have to get into the export market if we are going to improve the viability of our horticultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In the earlier part of this century, with only one or two animals brought to this country at any one time for breeding purposes, the Quarantine Act of 1908 obviously served its purpose. Now we are looking at whole herds being brought in by importers and therein lies the problem. I believe that the amendments contained in this Bill add a new provision to the Act, enabling the Commonwealth and the owner to enter into an agreement about the payment of quarantine expenses. I certainly welcome these amendments-as does the Opposition, and that is pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the current time the outstanding debt as of 30 April 1991 is over $1m. I believe that this Bill, small though it may be, will tighten up and make sure that people who do use our quarantine services actually pay. I commend the Bill to the house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise with pleasure to announce the Opposition's support for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991. This is significant because it is the first time in eight years that there has been bipartisan support for a major piece of Aboriginal affairs legislation. This has come about due to six months work and consultation, and it has come about because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) and the Government have been very much prepared to substantially address the concerns of the Opposition on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Minister first put the Bill to me in the form of a discussion paper six months ago, I did have very serious concerns. I was concerned that such a council might end up like another constitutional commission-doing its own thing and really not aware of the imperative that was put on it by the political process. I was concerned that such a vehicle might be a body for activists, and I was really concerned as to what it might achieve on the ground for Aboriginal people. Those concerns have been addressed through six months of pretty hard work on both sides. I would suggest that this Council will set new ground for Commonwealth advisory bodies in terms of its focus, in terms of its goals and, hopefully, in terms of its outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> This Council will operate via a strategic plan. This strategic plan will state its goals and objectives and its strategy for achieving those goals; it will describe its programs, estimate the cost of the programs, set out performance indicators and targets, prepare a plan every three years and report annually to the Federal Parliament. I think this is a model that many other advisory bodies could learn from because it does mean that there will be that accountability, that it will be goal oriented with a definite focus and, hopefully, its performance will be such that there will be a real chance to achieve something worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, I believe that this body will be particularly accountable in a way in which other bodies have not been accountable in the past. In addition to a strategic plan, it must annually report on its progress towards reconciliation, annually set out its performance against performance indicators as set out in the strategic plan, have its annual report referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, have its report tabled and debated in both Houses, and operate within the limits of the resources made available for its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is particularly pleased at the focus that the Minister and the Government have agreed on for the Council; that is, that the Council will focus its work mainly on a process of reconciliation at a community level. I note with pleasure and thanks that the Minister has agreed to further recommendations, which will be moved later in the debate, that will strengthen that community focus by making a change in proposed section 6 (1) (a) to say that the Council must have as its focus working community by community. The Opposition insisted on this essentially because it has two concerns: first, the Opposition does not particularly believe in grand plans in this area and, secondly, the Opposition is concerned not to raise the hopes and expectations of Aboriginal people only to have them dashed. </PARA>
<PARA> To speak on the first point, it was my strong impression as I moved around rural and remote Australia and talked to Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities that where things have worked well they have done so because people at a community level have made the effort to get up and get going in solving their own problems. In many ways, they have worked in spite of government, not because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's second concern about not wanting to raise the hopes and expectations of Aboriginal people only to have them dashed comes from the clear message I got from Aboriginal people and organisations when consulting them about this Bill. Quite simply, when I asked Aboriginal organisations for their opinions on this process of reconciliation, I was told, `We will not get our hopes up. We want to see whether you in Canberra can get your act together first. If you can do that, maybe we will put some work into it'. I think that puts a fair responsibility on our shoulders here. That is why I have been prepared to work with the Minister on the basis of cooperation and common interest, and to put behind us some of the animosity we have had in Aboriginal affairs over the past eight years, because I think it is about time we attempted to get our act together here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> If anything is to be achieved in the area of Aboriginal affairs, it will be achieved with simple practical solutions, with realistic, measurable and achievable goals, with cooperation rather than confrontation and, quite simply, hard work free from political bickering. For these reasons, the Opposition is happy this will focus at a community level, because it will have some real chance of success there. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I am pleased that the Council will cooperate and consult with the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments. This is really just an extension of what I said before. There has been too much division in Aboriginal affairs and too little consultation and preparedness to work to find some common ground. If it is to succeed, it will have to understand fully and work within the Federal framework we have in this country. That is frustrating and limiting at times, but it is also a political reality. As I moved around the country and talked to State and Territory leaders of the Liberal and National parties and party organisations about this concept and whether they would be prepared to support it, I was heartened to find that in very few cases did I actually get what might be called a `gut reaction'. A logical and reasonable approach was adopted to it, as well as a preparedness to say, `We will move halfway, but we will not move the whole way.' I note the Government is also prepared to move halfway, so we now find ourselves hopefully getting our act together. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government has further picked up the Opposition's concerns about the nature of the Council and its secretariat, which will come from the full time Public Service, and that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will have some freedom in the person he may choose to be a nominee on the Council. That augurs very well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition still has two concerns about the Council and I foreshadow two amendments that I will move at the committee stage. However, I will not move these amendments to be petty. I put on the record that I do not intend them to take away from the fact that the Opposition is prepared to be fully bipartisan on this issue. The first proposed amendment relates to the matter of the remuneration of Council members. This originally appeared in the Government's discussion paper back in December. I was particularly pleased with it because, in essence, the Council was going to comprise a group of prominent Australians giving their time voluntarily to try to achieve something worth while in this important area. In the past, committees of government have been open to the criticism that they exist as an end in themselves rather than to try to achieve something really worth while. I was concerned to see that people should not be out of pocket for serving on such a committee, but should not actually make money out of it. So the proposed amendment will delete clause 19 on remuneration and replace it with a new clause 19, which will read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a person (other than an ex officio member of the Council) who is a member of the Council or a member of a committee or who is both is to be reimbursed the expenses that the person reasonably incurs in performing duties under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>My second amendment will be to clause 6 (1), to add new clause 6 (1) (k), that the Council should:</PARA>
<PARA>monitor and evaluate:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the implementation of benchmarks in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander well-being, as agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the progress towards achieving those benchmarks.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for this amendment is quite simple. There seems to me to be an expectation in Aboriginal affairs that process equates with outcome. To explain further, the House of Representatives Aboriginal Affairs Committee recently looked at the community development and employment program-the single most important program administered by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Although this program has been going for many years, the Committee was able to get virtually no information on outcomes. When the Committee asked ATSIC for that information we received piles of facts and figures. Facts and figures are the process. That is how we do it. The Committee was looking for what is at the end. Is everything we are doing making things better or worse?</PARA>
<PARA> I have had discussions with the Minister who assures me that the legislation as written does not preclude the Council examining benchmarks; I thank the Minister for that consideration. The Opposition considers this issue of benchmarks to be the most fundamental issue in Aboriginal affairs. Quite frankly, the impression of many people in this field is that things are going backwards and that in spite of all our best efforts things are actually getting worse. But that is only an impression; we have no objective way of working out where we really are, where we are coming from and where we are going to. For this reason, I propose to move this amendment at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In foreshadowing this second amendment, again in no way do I seek to diminish the fact that there is full cross-party support for this Bill. The Opposition thinks it would be an improvement. We wish to make the statement and are quite prepared to leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my sincere hope that the Council might provide some leadership, because that is desperately needed in Aboriginal Australia and the broader community today, so the whole community might take a fresh look at itself, its history and its hopes for the future. A council like this, which works in a constructive and positive manner and realises what is achievable in Australian society and then goes for what is achievable in the strongest possible way, might just provide that leadership and might make some difference. It seems to me that in Aboriginal affairs we desperately need a win. We have not had many wins in recent times. Certainly some good things have happened, but in the end we need to convince ourselves that we can make a difference and can do something worth while and that the end results of our efforts will be something positive on the ground for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my sincere hope that this somewhat hybrid Bill that has been a product of Government and Opposition cooperation-and, dare I say it, bipartisanship-will turn out to give us the win we need in Aboriginal affairs so that we can convince ourselves that all this has been really worth while. That puts very great importance on the people who will make up the Council and on the person who will be its Chair. I hope that when they take up their appointments they are mindful of what we have gone through to try to get our act together so that this may then go on and give us a win. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of things for a council such as this to address. We hope that it will be mindful that, if it is going to achieve anything worth while, it has to achieve something on the ground for Aboriginal people. There is a lot of cynicism about this in Aboriginal Australia, not just in white Australia, and the cynicism in Aboriginal Australia is, `Is there going to be anything in it for me? How is it going to affect my life?'. Again it is my hope that the Council is mindful of that and realises that, in the end, what is important in Aboriginal affairs is making some difference on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end we will not address every problem through this Council, and the Council is certainly not an end in itself. It is not going to deter me from what I believe to be the main issue in Aboriginal affairs, which is providing effective service delivery on the ground to Aboriginal people. Ultimately the success, or failure, of what we achieve in Aboriginal affairs is going to be nothing if the appalling state of health, housing, the lack of access to education and other issues relating to Aboriginal well-being are not addressed. Finally, this Council is going to last for 10 years. No-one can predict what will happen in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most moving speeches that I heard in my time as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs was at a dinner that the Minister arranged and kindly invited me to attend when Bishop Malcolm-an Anglican bishop in northern Australia, an Aboriginal man-got up at the end of the dinner and gave a very moving speech about his hopes and aspirations for the future. They were quite simple. They were not hopes and aspirations that looked to the past at all; they were hopes and aspirations for the future. He said, `All that Aboriginal people want is for someone to say, ``Sorry''.' We cannot undo the past. We have to look to the future. The first essential step in that is just simply saying `Sorry'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether this Council is that vehicle or not, I do not know; whether this Council provides the impetus for the Australian population to look to its future with some hope and some unity, I do not know. But it is my sincere hope that it will do just that and, for that reason, on behalf of the Opposition I give our support to the Council and I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991 is well deserving of the support that it has from both sides of this House. Immediately prior to my entry into politics, I had a legal practice in Mount Isa in western Queensland. My firm was retained by the West Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Legal Aid for about five years immediately prior to my election to this House. As the solicitor retained by that legal service, I provided legal advice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in a fairly large area north to Mornington Island, south to Birdsville, east to Julia Creek and west to the Northern Territory border. During that time I appeared for the family of a deceased Aboriginal at a coronial inquest prior to the matter being referred to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In fact, I was the instructing solicitor before that Royal Commission when it appeared at Doomadgee in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My five years with that legal service in Mount Isa certainly does not make me an expert on Aboriginal matters. However, I would say that it has given me some insight into the depth of racism suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was in Mount Isa in fact that a young Aboriginal man was gaoled and then remained in custody in circumstances that I believe were at least as outrageous as those endured by Lindy Chamberlain. Kelvin Condren was his name, and he was convicted of the murder of a woman in Mount Isa and received a life sentence. At the time evidence was in fact available that a man in gaol in Darwin had actually confessed to that murder. </PARA>
<PARA> After years of lobbying by his family, solicitors and friends, Kelvin was finally released from Stuart Creek gaol in Townsville. He had been in gaol for some seven years for a crime that he did not commit. In fact, there was evidence to suggest that he was actually in police custody in the Mount Isa watch-house at the time that the murder was committed. I must say that further aspects of that matter are currently being investigated by the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise that issue because, whilst I am not blaming the police, the courts or the media, or in fact any other identifiable group, for this obvious miscarriage of justice, I am blaming racism and misunderstanding-unspoken, unacknowledged racism, acting behind the scenes, I believe, to entrap someone like Kelvin Condren, in much the same way as I believe Lindy Chamberlain was the victim of underlying sexist attitudes. I believe that this Bill is an attempt to confront the sort of under the surface racism that enabled the tragedy that happened to Kelvin Condren to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody highlighted the factors which combined to explain the level of disadvantage, both economic and social, suffered by many Aboriginal people in Australia today, which honourable members would know has resulted in the over-representation of Aboriginal people in prisons and in police custody. The report also focused attention on the distrust, enmity and disputation that characterise the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. It is these underlying tensions that I believe must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will start a process of reconciliation which will enable us to start building bridges. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) emphasised that the need for a process of reconciliation has been recognised by all political parties. My research seems to show that the last time that there was similar bipartisan support on an Aboriginal issue was way back in 1967 when the Government and the then Labor Opposition actually worked together to secure constitutional change to effectively give Aboriginal people full citizenship. I cannot stress enough the significance of cross-party support for this Bill, and I certainly welcome the bipartisan stand being adopted by both the Government and the Opposition parties in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that there is an urgent need to educate non-Aboriginal Australians about the cultures of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. In particular, the tragic history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be told with the objective not of creating guilt but of fostering a compassion and empathy for Australia's indigenous people. As a solicitor retained by that Aboriginal legal service, I heard of individual life stories of many of my clients. I heard of grandparents who had died of measles and aunties and uncles who, as five-year-olds, actually hid in caves to avoid being taken away from their families to a reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard of Aboriginal stock workers being herded with nooses around their necks by white stockmen on horses, and of Aboriginal women who did not know who their fathers were because their mothers had been raped by white people. Just about every client had a family history involving early death or great suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recognised that it is this history of suffering, much of it extremely recent, that is the primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous people. It will be a central role of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation being established by this Bill to bring this history out into the open. The stories must be told and non-Aboriginal Australians must listen. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Aboriginal health strategy report highlighted the fact that Aboriginal people are still paying the cost of white contact with their lives. The report included the following tragic statistics: in all age groups and in all States and Territories, Aboriginal people suffer significantly higher mortality rates than the rest of the Australian population; for almost every cause of death, the death rates for Aboriginal people are between two and eight times greater than for non-Aboriginal people; Aboriginal children suffer much higher rates of rheumatic heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, ear infection, eye disease, asthma, and kidney disease than non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, it is children who have suffered most. In Doomadgee, a town in the far north-western corner of my electorate, one child has already died this year and many others have visited Mount Isa Base Hospital suffering from meningitis. As I said, non-Aboriginal Australia cannot ignore these sorts of tragedies any longer. Therefore, I believe that education will play a key role to help raise the level of awareness of Aboriginal history, cultures, dispossession and continuing disadvantage. Maureen Watson, a secondary teacher, wrote an article entitled Black Reflections in March 1982. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Racism is accepted as one of the norms of Australian society. Aboriginal students are alienated, misunderstood and neglected since teachers know nothing of the needs of Aborigines trying to fit into an alien system. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal studies must be made a top priority in schools if future generations are to avoid being as ignorant and racist as their predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the working party on a national Aboriginal health strategy makes the critical point that no matter how sound a strategy, or how broadly it is supported within the community, it will fail if there is a lack of political will and commitment on the part of governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that the cross-party political support can be emphasised enough; in fact, I believe that the value of such cross-party support for the process of reconciliation has been highlighted recently by the irrational and, some may say, racist response of some Queensland members of parliament to the mere mention of land rights by the Queensland Government. To suggest, as some Queensland State Opposition members of parliament have, that there will be a land grab for the Gold Coast or that Mount Isa Mines Ltd will have to cease operations if land rights were introduced I believe is a blatant misuse of the political process and, indeed, it was blatantly untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians-Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal-suffer as a result of the level of political debate that we saw in Queensland, where unfortunately there is not cross-party political support on Aboriginal issues. As Michael Howard, in his article entitled Australian Aboriginal Politics and the Perpetuation of Inequality, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal problem seen in a sociological perspective is the alienation of Aborigines from access to and utilisation of land, minerals, capital and human resources. The white majority in power has been able to define the Aboriginal problem differently. In their view Aborigines are deviants and should be assimilated and integrated into white society. </PARA>
<PARA>For far too long that has been the view of many in society. As the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs (Dr Wooldridge) has just said in his speech, the legislation before the House will free Aboriginal affairs from the bickering of politics, which I am sure is welcomed by everyone in this House. In his second reading speech, the Minister stated that the legislation will set up a council that will have as its objects, inter alia, the promotion by leadership, education and discussion a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and of the need to redress that disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully support the Bill. I congratulate the Opposition on the forward thinking approach it has adopted in relation to this legislation. I believe it should have the full support of everybody in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be speaking on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill and to be again expressing the support of the Opposition for its basic thrust. I believe that the need for a better relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and the importance of that better relationship to achieving improvement in the area of Aboriginal disadvantage would command near universal support; it certainly commands the support of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was struck, however, during the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) by his reference to his work with the Aboriginal Legal Service because that means that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who first spoke on this Bill, the honourable member for Kennedy, who was the third speaker on the Bill, and I represent what one would call a narrow strand of Australian opinion because I have also had a long association with the Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be useful in this debate to bear in mind that for many people in Australia that would be regarded as a disqualification from having a sound opinion. It may not be from those of us who have spent many years thinking and working in this area of policy. I mention that because it is very important that this debate is realistic and that we acknowledge the reasons why we need a process of reconciliation. We need it because there are real and genuine difficulties out there in the community and there are some powerful attitudes, some of which are strongly supportive of Aboriginal Australians but others which clearly are not. There is a great deal of unhappiness and uncertainty and, at times, I think resentment. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill is about anything, it is about our lack of success in weeding those things out of Australia in the past and the need to do something different. I hope it will be accepted in this debate that it is important to acknowledge the difficulties, because if there were no difficulties this legislation would not be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very important to acknowledge progress. When we stop to think about it, I think we can find progress with respect to infant mortality-something that is pretty fundamental. We can find progress in the fact that there are now hundreds-more than a thousand, I think-of Aboriginal graduates, whereas just a few years ago there were none. We can find progress in the fact that many Aboriginal people now live in houses, whereas once they lived in car bodies, but we know there are still plenty of the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to know that the very considerable political effort, the administrative effort and, on the part of the Australian taxpayer, the financial effort have brought some rewards, but many people believe they have brought nothing but difficulty. That is not a right wing or tory view. I will never forget my last conversation with the late Dr Charles Rowley. Those of us who have worked in this field will acknowledge that he is a great Australian contributor. His research into the Aboriginal condition in New South Wales in the 1960s is set out in detail in books such as Outcasts in White Australia, and was part of the educational material that I used as a younger man and as a lawyer to try to understand why there were so many dreadful situations affecting Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Rowley was appointed by the Whitlam Government to head up the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. He remained in that position under the Fraser Government and was a trusted friend and adviser to me, as he was to the previous Government and I am sure to many members of the Australian Labor Party. In my last disturbing conversation with him here in Canberra-and I am talking now of the early 1980s; I am not scoring some political point about the present Government-the point he made to me was that he was redoing his research and he had found that many things were worse. Sadly, he died soon after, and I chased up the research he was doing. I do not have it with me still, but I remember, for example, that with respect to Aboriginal unemployment there was a significant worsening of the situation in the period from the early 1960s to the early 1980s, a period of unprecedented effort, with the unlocking of very considerable financial and human resources. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that reality that is part of the overall resentment one finds in the community and, at times, even in the political parties we represent-I believe on both sides of the chamber. This is a delicate task we undertake because where there has been lack of progress it is disturbing. If we want further evidence of that, we can read the speeches of successive Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs. I take a close interest in this portfolio and I have watched all the Ministers who have held it since I had that privilege in the late 1970s. There is a disturbing similarity about all the speeches. If we look at what was said by Minister Viner, the first Minister in the Fraser Government, we find a catalogue of Aboriginal disadvantage. I found it necessary to be very repetitive of that catalogue. The early speeches of the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the table, could have been made 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is a very sobering reminder of the fact that we come in here in good faith and often, in fact, on a bipartisan basis-the recent conflict over the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) obscures that. There was bipartisan support for the extraordinary change represented by the Northern Territory land rights legislation, and broadly bipartisan support, as I recall it, for the Aboriginal Development Commission established during my term. There have been plenty of opportunities for bipartisanship which have been availed of. But the fact is that we have not made as much progress as we would like. I think this Bill is about tackling one of the fundamental reasons why. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to generalise because, of course, Aboriginal people are as individual as the rest of us, but when we visit a town or settlement or suburb or city and find a good situation, it seems to me that there are usually two factors. The first is leadership, and there are occasionally exceptional people who produce exceptional outcomes. It is very dangerous to mention names; I dropped one name off the list after talking to someone this afternoon because he told me it probably was not very wise to mention it. When I visited Yandeyarra in Western Australia, for example, I thought that the calm and strong leadership of Peter Coffin was a marvellous influence. In the old days at Hooker Creek, before it became Lajamanu, Morris Luther obviously had a strong and benign personal influence which avoided some of the problems that one found at Yuendumu or other places where there was tension and a great deal of unhappiness. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor that I think has been a strong influence in the places where I have found satisfaction about the position and status of Aboriginal Australians has been a genuine community involvement. Again, I was struck by the fact that the honourable member for Kennedy spoke because when I was Minister so long ago the place I most enjoyed visiting was in his electorate, Cloncurry. I thought I could sum up what was right about Cloncurry by simply telling the story of returning there as Minister for Social Security to open a small aged persons unit built by a community organisation fostered by the Anglican Church. There were four little units in one block, occupied by four elderly women, two Aboriginal and two non-Aboriginal. I thought: one would not go into a lot of Australian towns and find that. Yet that was typical of the sense of cooperation and involvement that I found in that town. </PARA>
<PARA> Where did that sense of cooperation and involvement come from? It came from splendid Aboriginal people such as Ruby and Viv Tim on the Aboriginal side. On my first visit to that town, I nearly dropped. The shire president was addressing a meeting and Viv Tim interjected and said, `Come on, hurry up, you talk too long'. I thought the floor would open under him. The shire president said `Yeah, you're right, Viv, I do', and brought his speech to a close. I actually have not seen too many Aboriginal interjectors on shire presidents get that sort of response. Then there is the extraordinarily devoted work of people such as the Reverend Ray Ayles and the Reverend Harvey Sutton. Ray Ayles now has the spiritual guidance of the shadow Minister on my left, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and I wish him well. The honourable member will, I am sure, require all his reserves of charity and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA> There was a tradition in that town of involvement by community leaders which was, I think, entirely benign, and I believe that is what this Bill is trying to construct. Let me say to the honourable member for Kennedy that the late Bob Katter, his predecessor, was a splendid contributor to that. Bob Katter, in bringing me as a Minister into his community, spoke in terms of both affection and respect for his Aboriginal constituency. That is all part of the pattern that I believe is absolutely essential if we are to achieve success where in the past we have too often achieved failure. We have to learn, in our approach to Aboriginal affairs, how to multiply the good examples and how to learn from our mistakes, and goodwill is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a point where I wish to utter some cautions. If the Minister and the Government genuinely wish to promote reconciliation at the community level, then I think they need to be aware that a lot of the things that are said in the best possible faith can be utterly destructive. I think there is a great need to avoid theatre and a great need to avoid the totemic. What may give us a wonderful warm glow and what may be very pleasing to Aboriginal activists may in fact promote the enlargement of barriers between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the simplest example contained in this legislation. The preamble contains in its first two paragraphs what to me are simple acknowledgments of historical reality: the reality of the occupation of this country by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who have been here for thousands of years, and that that was the position prior to British settlement; and the fact that since settlement we have had many people suffering dispossession and dispersal from their traditional lands. That is a statement of fact; but I think it is important to understand that, for many Australians, there is a great resistance and a great depth of resentment about the notion of guilt. </PARA>
<PARA> Our own shadow Minister, to whom I pay great respect because of his strenuous and splendid work in this portfolio, referred to an Aboriginal bishop, Bishop Malcolm, saying, `Perhaps people should say ``I'm sorry''.' I want to put up the caution that I think there is a splendid reserve of goodwill in the Australian community for doing something now about present Aboriginal disadvantage, about present injustice, about remedying the wrongs of now, and there is an enormous resistance in the community to the notion of our carrying a burden of guilt and spending too much time in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I can say this from direct personal experience: the other night I walked out of that most interesting United States film, Dances with Wolves, and managed before I reached my car to have a violent row with a neighbour on this very subject. Again I am sorry to throw in what might be a meaningless anecdote, but unless we understand that there is a strong stream in the Australian community and, I believe, in both our political parties as well which sees the guilt notion as being something that is a barrier to solving present problems and a barrier to our living together, then I do not think we will do this job well. I think we need to be very cautious. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been very critical of the Government in the past for its approach to national land rights and the treaty, and I have said some of the rudest things I have ever said in politics about the Prime Minister's contribution to the debate on those issues. I think it has been wrong and destructive. In the same vein, if this is to succeed there does need to be the tight focus that is now possible under the legislation, possible under the changes negotiated with the Government by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm. It is very important that the Government consider that not as a matter of form, something we do to achieve bipartisanship, but as something that is very much part of the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to close by mentioning two other people. I had the benefit of a meal with Charles Perkins a few months ago when he was in Canberra. I wish that every Australian could have heard what he said across the dinner table about the message that he is trying to put out to Aboriginal Australia, because it sounds awful coming from a middle class white Australian. Basically he was saying that the person who can solve the problem is the person who is looking at you while shaving in the morning, or when you put on your lipstick in the morning, or when you wash your face in the morning: it is you. Again in this discussion it is important to acknowledge that Aboriginal Australia, given the tools which are available from government, has its salvation in its own hands.</PARA>
<PARA> The other person I want to mention is a Catholic priest whose name I cannot remember, I am sorry, but he was from Bathurst Island. Just a few weeks ago he was quoted in the weekend press as saying that perhaps the contribution that each Australian could make would be to go out and make friends with a couple of Aboriginal people. In a funny sort of way, I think that is right, because basically we are talking here about a sense of community and about providing an environment in which Aboriginal people will feel that, if they work and try, their efforts will be rewarded and that they are part of a community which accepts, respects and, indeed, gives them the love and affection they are entitled to in the community. That again underlines the delicacy of this task, because that cannot be produced by passing a law. It has not been produced by a lot of wise effort and the contribution of many good people. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that, if we are to succeed and if there is to be any long term faith on this side of the House in the notion of bipartisanship, the Labor Party should also understand that there is a belief on our side of politics that the Labor Party has been ruthless in its vote gathering among the Aboriginal community. I mention that because I think we should be realistic, and I think that unless we get--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some faults on our side-I certainly concede that-but I think that we actually have to avoid that touch of political ruthlessness which muddies the debate. Again, I offer that because I think it is a genuine barrier to the sort of across the chamber cooperation which is necessary. I commend the Bill, I commend the Minister for his efforts to produce a new approach, and I commend our own shadow Minister for doing so much to ensure that the Government now has an approach which we can support.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure indeed to speak in this debate. At the outset I would like to acknowledge the contributions that have already been made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). I will not say, because it would be dishonest of me, that I agree with everything that the honourable member for Pearce has said. I would certainly take issue, for example, with the last portion of his contribution. But now is not the time to do that; perhaps at some other stage we will get the opportunity to discuss that in some detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also acknowledge the contribution of lawyers-God forbid-to the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. Not only have the honourable member for Pearce, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Kennedy all been involved with Aboriginal legal services, but I see also my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr)-yet another ex-employee of an Aboriginal legal service. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a person who passionately believes in the need for Australia to come to terms with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. That demands of us a number of things. It demands of us that we approach this question in a proper bipartisan way. I wish to acknowledge publicly now-as I have not had the ability to do so before because, quite frankly, it has not been forthcoming-the way in which the Opposition has approached this matter in a bipartisan manner. The fact that the Government has been prepared to accept a small number of proposed amendments by the Opposition to this legislation to ensure its passage is, I think, testimony to the goodwill that exists on both sides of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I would caution all of us to remember that in a sense we represent the peak bodies of our respective organisations in this place. The fact of the matter is that not all of the elements of the conservative parties in Australia support the propositions which have been put forward in this legislation. That is nowhere clearer, as the honourable member for Kennedy pointed out, than in Queensland at present, where there is a very public debate about the issue of land rights. That is a subject which I hope we get the opportunity to discuss in some detail sometime later, because it seems to me that there is a necessity for the Australian community to recognise the justice of Aboriginal claims to land. </PARA>
<PARA> If this reconciliation process, in part, gets those things on the agenda, then I think that is important. What is more important, in a sense, however, is that we non-Aboriginal and non-Islander Australians come to terms with the reality of Aboriginal and Islander Australia and recognise the injustices of the past, for that will allow us to come to terms with the present and to plan for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> That necessarily means that we need, as a group of people, as a nation, to approach this issue without imposing the cultural baggage that could limit our horizons. This should not be a debate which is determined by the lowest common denominator. This is a debate which should be determined by what is just and what is right. What is just and what is right necessarily means recognising, belatedly, at least, the sorrowful past that has beset Aboriginal and Islander Australians since the occupation of this country in 1788. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to just point to the preamble that has been recognised by the honourable member for Pearce already, because it is important that we understand the context. It is important, when we are talking to those people outside of this place who might not yet understand what we are on about, that they themselves understand the reality, the truth, about Australia's past so that they too can come to terms with our present and be able to plan properly for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with a great deal of sorrow that I express those remarks, because in a sense the person who epitomised that sort of approach to Australian history left us recently. Manning Clark was a person who fought deeply for this concern for Aboriginal and Islander Australians, and who said to us: `You must come to terms with your past to deal with the present and effectively plan for the future'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other very prominent non-Aboriginal Australian who has spent his working life-at least the last 30 years-dedicated to trying to get non-Aboriginal Australians to recognise the reality that not only confronts our history but also confronts Aboriginal and Islander Australians every day, and that of course is Nugget Coombs. Nugget, when he was advancing the cause of a treaty, or a makarrata, wrote a book for Aboriginal Australians. I want to quote briefly from a portion of that book. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The occupation of the continent has therefore been one of territorial conquest and the aggression by which it was achieved has never been formally concluded . . . </PARA>
<PARA> This occupation has been defended by reference to a legal doctrine accepted by European governments and by the great colonising powers-that where newly discovered lands were `desert and uncultivated' it could be presumed that no organised society or system of government existed among the inhabitants and that a nation could lawfully take possession of them and establish colonies in them. </PARA>
<PARA> This doctrine was convenient for colonising powers but, not surprisingly, there is no evidence that its validity was ever acknowledged by other people. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, we occupy this land as the result of territorial conquest justified or excused by a doctrine unilaterally determined and even then inapplicable to the true circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>It is of fundamental importance that non-Aboriginal Australians understand that reality. When we discuss what this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is and how it will work, we should understand that acknowledging that reality means that we have to give it some recognition to how we nonAboriginal Australians deal with Aboriginal Australians in that forum. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a reality that we must deal with them, as the honourable member for Chisholm said, on a daily basis in terms of the administration of services. It is true, in part, that governments have spent a lot of money and it is true that we argue accountability, but it is also true that we have not given Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders their dues in the way in which we treat them over these issues, their lives and the way they want to live them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, it is important that we understand that not all areas of conservative politics in Australia accept the reality of this debate. It is important, I think, as a message to the general community, that we argue vehemently that what we are talking about in this place in the spirit of bipartisanship should permeate the whole of the Australian community and certainly the whole of the Australian body politic. That will mean including the Northern Territory Government. I hope it gives the same recognition as the honourable member for Chisholm and the Opposition have, in the constructive way in which they have participated in this process, to recognising the reality and the importance of accepting that we all participate in this process of reconciliation in a constructive way and to not inhibiting its processes by, in many senses, dealing with Aboriginal and Islander Australians in a way which is not justified. This means accepting Aboriginal and Islander Australians as equals across the table to be able to discuss, consult and, dare I say it, negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs brought down a report entitled Our Future Our Selves, in which it examined the issue of consultation. I quote two paragraphs on that issue which deal specifically with why we must negotiate with Aboriginal and Islander Australians. This Committee report was endorsed unanimously. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes that the complete and extensive involvement of Aboriginal people in decision making must become a requirement, not an option. Instead of Aboriginal involvement being one element of the process of policy development and service delivery, it must pervade the whole process and be crucial to the final outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>4.56 The Committee concluded from the evidence provided to it that the practice of `consultation' does not support the level of Aboriginal involvement required to realise the policies of self-determination and self-management. Aboriginal people need to be actively involved in the settlement of the terms of the policies and programs as they apply to them and at a level which is more accurately described as `negotiation'. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue is that Aboriginal and Islander Australians have just demands. They have a right to be treated as equals and they have a right to argue that we deal with them through a process of negotiation. The process of reconciliation is extremely important. I go back to what I said at the beginning of my speech: we must treat them as equals and it must not be a question of the last common denominator in politics-what the worst people in our community will accept as legitimate. We are talking about something which is just and right. That means that we non-Aboriginal Australians need to be not afraid to stand up and say what we think and, if necessary, to try to lead people into accepting that what they are doing may be unjust and not right. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the Queensland Government has not acted in that way in the course of the land rights discussions. It has not accorded Aboriginal and Islander Australians in Queensland the justified place that they have in the process of consultation about the land rights legislation in Queensland. It is extremely important, if we are to move this debate forward, that Aboriginal and Islander Australians who reside in Queensland are treated properly by the Queensland Government. That means that it must negotiate with them over the issue of land rights in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The time for my contribution to this debate has nearly expired, but I point out that that process of discussion, consultation and negotiation about the issue of this process of reconciliation and about all other matters concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Australians means that we must all recognise now the reality of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; and, in recognising the reality of ATSIC, we must give due prominence and recognition to the Commissioners of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge with great pleasure that the ATSIC Commissioners are in the gallery this afternoon. It is with even greater pleasure that I see my bearded friend Geoffrey Shaw sitting next to Pat Turner in the gallery. Geoffrey, as some honourable members may or may not know, is an Aboriginal Australian who should not need any introduction to this place. He is an Aboriginal Australian who fought for this country, representing Australia in the armed forces in Malaya and in Vietnam, who came back to this country and could not go into a Returned Services League club. The shame that that should bring upon non-Aboriginal Australians is self-evident. It seems to me that, if by the year 2000 we have not come to terms with this process of reconciliation and out of that process obtained an agreement, an article or treaty through negotiation with Aboriginal Australians, we too will have failed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have heard a number of moving speeches saying what should be obvious but, unfortunately, too frequently is not. It is a matter of real surprise to many Australians when they learn of the history of their own country on the issue of the contact between non-Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginal Australians. `Contact' is a very neutral word. `Contact' suggests perhaps something that would involve little pain or little consequence, but the history of the dispossession of Aboriginal people in this country through their contact with the European invaders comes to most non-Aboriginal Australians as a complete surprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Generations of non-Aboriginal Australians have grown up with a very poor education about Aboriginal Australia. As recently as 1967 my own official New South Wales history textbook for year 10 said Aborigines who lived in towns would `recklessly share their possessions with parasitic relatives and friends'. </PARA>
<PARA>Similar textbooks have very little history of the contact between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. It is only slowly, though the work of scholars such as Manning Clark, who began some of this ground-breaking work-and more recently scholars such as Professor Henry Reynolds and Dr Coombs-that we really begin to see the tragedies that unfolded for those who were the original inhabitants of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Only when one sees the tragedies unfold for those people-how they were driven from their lands; how their resistance was broken; how their fight was broken through military means-and the terrible repressions that were meted out to Aboriginal people in place after place throughout this country, can one begin to understand how far we are from reconciliation and why something that ought to be entirely non-contentious has stirred such emotions. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard it as a matter of some pride that we as a Parliament can come together to agree to a council dealing with these issues. It should not be a matter of pride, but it has to be as a result of our starting so far behind in our understanding. In my own State of Tasmania, generations of non-Aboriginal Australians grew up being told and taught that there were no Tasmanian Aboriginal people. They were educated to believe that the last Tasmanian Aboriginal was a woman called Truganini who died in the late 1800s. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal Tasmanians do survive and do persist and they are only now gaining their voice. Around Australia now Aboriginal people are only beginning to gain the voice that they are entitled to. Their voice will become stronger and more powerful through institutions such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which gives back to elected Aboriginal people control over the management of funds which maintain programs that are designed to improve Aboriginal living standards. Most importantly, the ATSIC process is part of a process of giving back to Aboriginal Australians pride and self-determination. Self-determination does not mean much if it is just an abstract set of words, because there is no meat in self-determination; there is no substance in self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Self-determination has substance when it is coupled with realistic programs designed to make sure that the capacity for real choice is available to Aboriginal Australians. Without the capacity for real choice, without being able to make meaningful decisions, self-determination is really just a couple of words. That is why it is so important that we have to reach out to our fellow non-Aboriginal Australians so that they have to come to terms with what it means to make provision in this country for those whom we have dispossessed and neglected for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to get away from the tragic debates that occurred some years ago about land rights in our country when the mining companies put up the most disgraceful propaganda and created an atmosphere of fear so that governments were scared away from programs which would have led to the establishment of national land rights legislation. It is important, therefore, that we start at the beginning by recognising that we are the inheritors, not Aboriginal Australians, of a land grab of a continent where the original inhabitants were dispossessed by force and really not cared about for many years. As Professor Reynolds and others will say, the idea was put about by many in those early days of dispossession that the Aboriginal people would simply die out; they were a doomed race. Policy was not designed around their preservation and protection; it was designed around compassion to see them quietly fade from the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that, I am surprised that there is so little anger in the Aboriginal community. We all find some difficulty when we are confronted by anger. From time to time even those of us who are at the forefront of advocacy of Aboriginal rights, as the Minister has been, find themselves in the firing line of anger from Aboriginal people. I, working in the Aboriginal Legal Service and outside it, have also found myself the focus of Aboriginal people's anger. If one has not found oneself the focus of some anger, one has not had much to do with Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that there is so little anger. As the Minister has said, there are so many people who look forward to the future with optimism. They recall the past with sadness. They are able to tell us about their own families, of children who may have been taken from them and of elderly relatives who were treated appallingly as servants or less by non-Aboriginal people. Some cannot tell us about their family histories at all because of the tragedies that occurred to break up their connection with their ancestral places and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the surprising thing is that there is so little anger. That means that there is a chance to bring together Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. We cannot do it if we pretend that an act of reconciliation is somehow an extension of generosity of this Parliament. It is not a generous act. It is simply a recognition that for far too long we have turned a blind eye to our own national disgrace and our own national history. That flows from the difficulty in seeing clearly where one's own self-interests are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that I am continually taken to task about by some non-Aboriginal Australians is this question of land rights and the argument that in some ways land rights would give to Aboriginal Australians rights different from those of ordinary non-Aboriginal Australians. The argument often advanced by people of goodwill is, `Look, we're all equal now in Australia. There might have been some dreadful things done to Aboriginal people in the past, but they have no greater claim on the community than you or I. We are all taxpayers, and what's all this business about land rights?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that, when our ancestors came to this country and displaced and dispersed Aboriginal people, the whole basis of wealth that was then created was by land grants. Land was passed without cost, or at very little cost, to settlers by way of grant. There was no payment for that land in the initial years. Freeholders were encouraged to come to this country from Europe and England to take up large spreads, to settle here and make themselves wealthy. Slowly, as time passed, money was a condition of taking up land grants. Huge tracts of Tasmania, for example, were given without any cost at all to the original settling families. </PARA>
<PARA> The wealth of many of our ancestors that stands behind our most prominent citizens and has formed the base of our industrial growth and the sustained economic development of this country, which has benefited non-Aboriginal Australians, has simply excluded Aboriginal people. They have been the victims. Their land formed the basis of capital, given originally to the first settlers for nothing. Having taken advantage of that in accumulated wealth, they applied that wealth to the expansion of the economic base of this country. In that whole process it was not Aboriginal Australians who benefited. Granting land rights really does no more than say that we have some responsibility to those original Australians who thus far have been held out of the kind of inheritance that every other non-Aboriginal Australian has been able to share in. It does no more than give them that opportunity to reclaim some of the land that was once theirs, to establish traditional relationships to it and to do something in real terms about putting flesh on the concept of self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is controversial. The proposal is to see whether we can bring together all Australians to think hard about what we need to do in these areas. I hope the fact that the proposal is not controversial does not mean that the process of seeking reconciliation does not involve controversial ideas. One of the things that I feel we have failed to do in this country in any significant debate is to work out how we can give effective political power sharing to Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I worked with Paul Coe in the Aboriginal Legal Service, and I believe he is one of the most significant thinkers about the way in which our relationship with Aboriginal Australians and non-Aboriginal Australians may develop. Part of my work was with respect to a submission on behalf of the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service Secretariat to the Constitutional Commission. In that submission, one of the ideas put forward was that Aboriginal Australians be entitled to the equivalent number of senators as those who come from a State, so there would be at least 12 Aboriginal members of parliament elected from around Australia representing that interest group of Aboriginal Australians, in the same way as we permit the representation of the State of Tasmania or New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> So, imagining the success we have had as a Labor Party in championing Aboriginal affairs, perhaps we would have the likely result of seven or eight Aboriginal senators on our side and, no doubt, the coalition would attract some Aboriginal votes and be so represented in the Senate. That would mean that, within our parliamentary process, we would have people representing a group of Australians who are so frequently forgotten because, in numerical terms, they do not represent a sufficient proportion of any particular seat to be elected. Although Neville Bonner did break the ice by becoming the first Aboriginal to be elected to this Parliament, it has not been repeated, tragically, and we now sit in this Parliament discussing reconciliation with Aboriginal people but there is not one Aboriginal member or senator. </PARA>
<PARA> If I went through the lists of those put forward for endorsement at the last Federal election campaign, I do not think I would find more than one or two Aboriginal candidates put forward by either major party, and certainly not for seats which were considered winnable. We need to look at ways in which we can cut new ground and initiatives to empower Aboriginal Australians, and not just talk about issues and refer to the sorts of areas where we might provide better funding, although I take some of the points that the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), has made about accountability and making sure that we have measurable targets and performance indicators. What he said was very sensible, and I am pleased with those sorts of responsible comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to shy away from the fact that we need to have fairly bold thinking in this area. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has quite rightly said, this is not an opportunity for lowest common denominator politics. We should not seek outcomes which represent what the least amenable thinkers in our society have towards Aboriginal interests. We must be willing to reach out to all Australians but, at the same time, provoke debate looking towards best solutions rather than solutions which are just as limited as the worst and most basic prejudices would permit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great hopes but I say this is only the first step. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs should be congratulated by everyone concerned on having built the coalitions around this proposal that he has, and I am delighted with that success. However, we have much to do before we can say that this process will bear fruit. It will be seen to have not been more than a good first step unless we build on this base with constructive and solid achievement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some pleasure that I rise in this debate to support the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill, which seeks to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. When I first heard this matter being floated, the actual word `reconciliation' left me with some problems as to what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) actually meant by it. So I eventually got around to looking at the Collins Concise Dictionary to see what it had to say about the word-and I apologise to the purists who had another dictionary in mind. In defining the word `reconcile', it states, `to make (oneself or another) no longer opposed; cause to acquiesce in something unpleasant: she reconciled herself to poverty'. I do not think the Minister had anything like that in mind. The next part of the definition states, `to become friendly with (someone) after estrangement or to re-establish friendly relations between (two or more people)'. To some extent, that says part of it. A further portion of the definition states, quite simply, `to settle (a quarrel or difference)'. Perhaps there is a grain of truth in that. The last definition states `to make (two apparently conflicting things) compatible or consistent with each other'. I guess that is the definition that I liked from the Collins Concise Dictionary, which sits very comfortably with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that that is the definition that I take it to be-and I am sure the Minister would agree that those words were fairly appropriate-I looked at the Bill and was very pleased to see under the heading `Object' that clause 5 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and the wider Australian community, based on an appreciation by the Australian community as a whole of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and achievements and of the unique position . . . the indigenous peoples of Australia, and by means that include the fostering of an ongoing national commitment to cooperate to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very interesting clause because it basically says two things: it accepts very simply the fundamental proposition, if one thinks very seriously about it, that indigenous people, the Aboriginal people, are a disadvantaged people in this nation, and that is something that needs to be resolved. It also says quite simply that there is a piece of culture and history that belongs to all Australians, and it is up to the broader community to take that on board. It is part of our culture and our history, and is something that is being lost rapidly at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the privilege in this place to serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Whilst not wishing to state too much about that Committee, one of its charters is to look into language maintenance. One thing I have learned quite briefly in that Committee is that there is a sense of urgency required for the culture of the Aboriginal people. There is no doubt that, in Victoria, Tasmania and parts of New South Wales, because of the loss of language, there is a loss of culture, and that is a tragedy that all Australians face. We are a much poorer people because we have lost this culture. It is something that needs to be addressed very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone from the white Australian population, I must say that there is very little that I can do about it. It is a personal frustration to me that I know very little about it, and I would like to know a lot more. I would like to think that the next generation of Australians will have the opportunity, through schools and general education programs, to learn more about the culture of Australia's indigenous people. The responsibility lies with the Aboriginal people, who are the custodians of that culture, to guard that culture with the dignity and pride that it deserves, and to be able to pass it on to the broader community so we will all feel proud of it. This will be the saviour of the Aboriginal people, with the dignity that it will bring them, and the understanding of the broader Australian community is most important. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one thing in the Bill that I would like to bring to the Minister's attention-something that he may look at changing somewhere down the track. He said the Chairman of the Council must be an Aborigine. That is positive discrimination and I can understand the arguments for doing that. But, if we are going to give the recognition and dignity to the Aboriginal people that they deserve, that particular Council ought to elect its own Chairman. I would very much hope that an Aboriginal person would be there in his own right, because he deserved to be in that position, rather than through a ministerial directive. It is only by achieving something in one's own right that one can stand up and be counted as an equal. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Minister has given the Council the freedom to hold its meetings in ways other than face to face, sitting around a boardroom or in an office. Council members can use any means of communications-for example telephone or closed circuit television-determined by Council. I think that is a splendid thing to put into a clause. With modern technology, it gives the flexibility for what I hope will be a wide and diverse range of people to be able to communicate around Australia without having to put in an enormous number of flying hours and without impinging on the time constraints that eminent Australians have. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see that provision, especially when one considers that we will be moving an amendment that basically says that positions on the Council are voluntary positions and that, while the Government will pay out of pocket expenses, one cannot replace time and cannot give time back to the people who donate it. If we can short circuit the process and make it somewhat easier for people to contribute, I am sure that the Council will work much better. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the working of the Council is not only a responsibility of the Federal Government; I believe the State governments and local governments must all play a part. I believe the most important part will be at the grass roots, where the real problems have to be resolved. It is very difficult for well-meaning people in this place to make decisions and have them carried out at the grass roots level. It is the goodwill of the grass roots participants that will resolve their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see in the letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) mention of the success of a grass roots process of reconciliation in the township of Moree. I hope that the Council takes this on board and uses it as a model that may be replanted in other places. </PARA>
<PARA> Having mentioned that, I have to say as a Victorian that what may work in Moree and outback Australia may not be effective in my part of the world. In my seat of McMillan, it is apparent that we have a somewhat different problem from that of isolated Aboriginal communities. One of the good things in my electorate is that an Aborigine who is well known to Australia-Lionel Rose-lives there. Lionel Rose is held up as a success story, but he is a success story by the broad Australian standard. I understand that he is also very much a success story in his own community. We judge things such as success on different values, and herein lies one of the great problems that I see in the urban population in Australia. Unfortunately and tragically, we often see bad publicity involving a few Aboriginals who have problems with alcoholism. That is presented as the public face of the Aboriginal community. Some shopkeepers in my electorate complain to me that the bad publicity afforded to such people affect their businesses. A natural anger has then built up between people who have their businesses impacted upon and people who, through alcoholism, are not giving the Aboriginal community a good public relations image. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet that is the unfortunate tip of the iceberg. There are also the people whom I call the quiet Australians, the quiet Aboriginal communities, who are part and parcel of the townships. They are people who are working away at jobs, who are responsible people, who have dignity and who have no problems with their neighbours, whether they be white or black. It is great to see those success stories; but, unfortunately, they are not news. They never get the headlines in the newspapers; they are never mentioned at local council meetings. We see only the down side. The more we can see the achievers in the Aboriginal community taking a higher profile and taking the responsibility within communities, the better off we will all be. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that we see on television too often is anger over land rights. We have seen it in Queensland, where a group of young Aborigines showed great anger over land rights. Most people who look at that problem say, `Well, they should not be doing that; the police should arrest them. They are damaging a fence and it is a bad sight to see'. I have got to concur that nobody in my position, nobody in this Parliament, could agree with people breaking the law or demanding something through violence. It shows me something that is not necessarily recognised: a sense of pride is starting to creep back into the Aboriginal community-the pride of being an Aborigine. Often the frustration appears in the younger members who want to get on and want dignity and independence, and it is reflected through an unfortunate face of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those in the broader Aboriginal community are starting to feel their own responsibilities as a people. When I see the Aboriginal flag being hoisted in the Parliament grounds in Queensland, I look at it and say that that is just the tip of the iceberg. The face behind that is a broader community of people who are proud of being Aboriginal and who want to say, `We will take our place in Australia'. That is something that should not be overlooked. Once again, the quieter achievers within the community ought to be coming forward and saying what they are on about. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand also the recent tragic history of the Aboriginal people, which often evokes great emotion in them. Fancy having babies taken away from their families and put into hostels. If that happened in the broader Australian community, we would be absolutely devastated. If we saw it happening overseas, there would be outrage about it. When it happened here-not so many years ago, within living memory-it was done with good intention, but it was thoroughly incorrect. There is a great anger out there in the Aboriginal people because of it. I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have heard evidence of the impact of R-rated and X-rated videos in Aboriginal communities and the cultural differences between their impact in what we call mainstream Australian communities and outback Aboriginal communities. We have had evidence of young children of five or six years of age being experimented on by their older brothers and sisters. For us to allow X-rated videos to be part of our Australian scene in such instances ought to be condemned. Anybody who thinks that we ought to allow X-rated videos in the Australian community should look at what is going on in some of the outback communities. I am sure they would immediately support the banning of those videos. </PARA>
<PARA> That evidence was given by a woman at a three-day council in Townsville last year. I have to say I walked out of that session with tears in my eyes and compassion for those young children who are being affected by what one can only say is the impact of mainstream culture on an outback community. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to end my speech by saying once again that it is tremendous to see the bipartisan approach to this issue. From time to time members of this House disagree with each other on a few points but the main thrust is down the same track, and that is tremendous to see. I wish the Council well in its deliberations, and I hope it can deliver to all Australians those things we hope it can. There is one area where I would differ slightly from the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who stated that Aboriginal people have a right to be treated as equals. I would vary that statement and say that we have an obligation to treat Aboriginal people as equals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some 203 years ago, white man's history tells us, a new country was born. Black man's history, if it were fully told, would tell a different story. For the whole of this time the events and actions of European and Asian settlers in establishing their communities have been recorded by white fellers as a conquest of a harsh and temperamental continent and its insignificant primitive inhabitants. For the murri and koori people of this continent, the arrival of the three ships from England with their cargo of unwanted criminals, vagabonds and homeless, marked the start of an ever widening process of destruction, murder, abuse, break-up of families and communities, dispossession, and devastation of culture and heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is only in the last 25 years that any meaningful attempts have been made to correct this pattern and to give murris and kooris some chance and reason to survive. It has really been only in the last decade that any structural changes have occurred in our approach to the preservation of Aboriginal culture and identity. But these have really only touched the surface. I agree with the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) on one point: the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill is not about recriminations or guilt or determining responsibility for the actions of the past 203 years. It is about giving the indigenous inhabitants of this land some hope for a future as part of the nation that now occupies this continent. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most persistent features of Aboriginal affairs has been the frequency of reports and studies by government agencies, the media, academics and others about every aspect of Aboriginal life. Perhaps just as remarkable has been the extent to which these reports and studies have been sorrowed over and then all too promptly forgotten. In this respect neither side of politics in this country can take any comfort. Our mutual eagerness to forget the frequent and blindingly obvious reminders of Aboriginal disadvantage that we are presented with is, quite frankly, embarrassing. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months, however, this Parliament has witnessed two stark reminders of the duty this nation owes to the indigenous people of Australia. In one case, that of the national Aboriginal health strategy, the Hawke Government has recognised that action is needed to the tune of committing $232m of additional Federal funds over five years to addressing the health needs of Aboriginal people. In October last year in this House I moved a private member's motion, supported by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hull), calling on governments at all levels to be forthcoming in allocating resources to implement the recommendations of the national Aboriginal health strategy. Only the Federal Government has responded. When will the States fulfil their responsibilities?</PARA>
<PARA> What is needed now is a real commitment, not just words, because nice words and no dollars have been a feature of government activity in Aboriginal affairs for too long. What is needed is not a flowery and ideologically sound commitment by State governments to the health strategy. What Aboriginal people quite rightly expect is that, in something of a break with the past, there will be an actual dollar commitment to keeping Aboriginal children alive longer, to keeping Aboriginal communities healthier, to keeping Aboriginal people out of hospital, and to addressing the appalling deficiencies in community infrastructure that give rise to the quite shocking health problems faced by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major report in this area that this Parliament has been presented with in the past few weeks is the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This inquiry has been criticised for its cost and for the fact that it kept a lot of lawyers wealthy. The fact is that, in terms of this country's approach to Aboriginal affairs, this is the report we had to have. The contents of the report are not particularly palatable. The Royal Commission's report provides all of us in this House, however, with a blueprint for action on the wide range of issues affecting Aboriginal people. Let it not become merely the subject of well-meaning press releases, speeches, questions and commentaries by politicians and others in our community. There must be action to follow the words. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the functions of the Bill now before the House is to foster an ongoing national commitment to cooperate in addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. It is my belief that the machinery established by this Bill will ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission will receive from this House and from the Australian people the profound attention they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the remarks of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who urged State governments to play their part in this process. State governments, regardless of their political colour, have a duty to join with the Commonwealth in affording Aboriginal people some measure of the justice they deserve. The most obvious way for State governments to do this is by putting their money where their mouth is-in the way the Federal Government has with the national Aboriginal health strategy. Through this legislation today Australia will have an ongoing facilitator of action to implement the recommendations of these reports, and some of the others that have preceded them, in a non-political and non-divisive manner. For Aboriginal people to have any sort of hope for a future, this is fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to another important issue. One of the words much bandied about in the year leading up to the introduction of this Bill is `bipartisanship'. This House has rarely witnessed true bipartisanship. I suppose it is in the nature of an adversarial party political democracy such as ours that bipartisanship is difficult to achieve. One of the issues, however, on which this Parliament has shown a willingness to adopt a genuinely bipartisan approach is the field of human rights. Quite rightly, Australia has an admirable reputation internationally as a champion of human rights. Australian politicians, for all our championing of causes beyond these shores, tend to have something of a blind spot on occasions when it comes to Aboriginal affairs. Aboriginal affairs, so the thinking goes, are not a human rights issue; they are the stuff of domestic politics. </PARA>
<PARA> As many on this side of the House have said for some time, Aboriginal issues are too important to be the plaything of politicians in search of a king hit. The king hitters have had a pretty good run in recent years but, quite frankly, their time has passed. Honourable members will recall, some with shame and some with disgust, the innuendo and quite blatant racism that has been directed at Aboriginal people through the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in recent years. As usual, when politicians deign to play games with Aboriginal affairs, Aboriginal people themselves are the main losers. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Bill seeks to achieve is not some smug agreement between the conservative parties and the Government. Rather, it is about achieving some measure of justice for Aboriginal people-justice in the sense of achieving a public view of Aboriginal people that is not consistently negative; justice in the sense that Aboriginal people receive from all governments the degree of support that is so obviously necessary; and justice in the sense that Aboriginal people are no longer fair game for politicians with a few cheap points to score at the expense of a section of Australian society not well placed to defend itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) for his efforts to secure some degree of bipartisanship within his own Party. I am aware, from talking with the Minister and from my own experience of honourable members on the other side, that there is in the Opposition a reservoir of goodwill and principle that can be drawn upon whenever the temptation arises for some to score a few cheap and transitory points by kicking black heads. </PARA>
<PARA> Bipartisanship does not mean that we in the Government will cop it sweet whenever the Opposition elects to use Aboriginal affairs in an attempt to score points; nor does it mean that we have reached some sweetheart agreement with the Opposition in order to push through our agenda in Aboriginal affairs. Bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs means active and constructive involvement by both sides in pursuit of the necessary programs for change. More specifically, a bipartisan approach to this Bill means that the Opposition will not be able to vote in favour of this Bill and then simply walk away from its responsibility to Aboriginal people. Opposition support for this Bill involves a commitment to the work of the Council over the coming decade. The structure, membership, functions and powers of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will give everyone in our country an opportunity to contribute in a positive and meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important that the Council contains members of parliament as appointees, as this will ensure a direct and ongoing relationship between the Council and the Parliament. It will provide an avenue for the constructive participation of all groups in this Parliament in the work of the Council and ensure we are kept in touch with the issues being addressed. I congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for his vigour and commitment in pursuing this cause. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like a number of members of this House, both past and present, I serve on the Standing Committee for Aboriginal Affairs. In my short time in this place I have had the opportunity to travel reasonably extensively around this country and to see some of the situation of our Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and others who have worked for many years with Aboriginal communities in one form or another, I am a relative newcomer because I only came to this country in 1977. There are those who have said to me that, therefore, I really do not understand, that I do not realise what it is all about, that I have not had to live with the problem, and so on and so forth. However, I would say to this House, as I said in our party room when we discussed this two or three weeks ago, that the fact that I am a newcomer will perhaps give me some degree of objectivity, which is often lacking in those who have been fortunate enough to live in this country all their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> By whatever yardstick one chooses to use, I believe the Aboriginal community in this country is in an unacceptable situation. Whether one is talking about rural communities, remote communities or urban communities, or whether one is measuring in terms of life expectancy, the disproportionately high number of Aborigines in gaol, the grog problems which lead to the violence problem, the poor standards of health and education and the incredibly high levels of unemployment-all of these well evidenced by the recent Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-the Aboriginal community of this country is a disadvantaged group. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense it almost does not matter who is to blame-of course, it does matter-because the bottom line is that whatever has gone before has failed. Money alone is not the answer; obviously money is important, but it is not the only answer. Money needs to be delivered at the sharp end where it is needed and not perhaps, I suggest, on some of the Aboriginal bureaucratic industry that has grown up in certain quarters. However, money is not the real issue. It seems to me that we need a new initiative and I believe the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill could be it, or at least part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot ignore the history behind the present situation. There have been mistakes made on both sides of the argument and on all sides of politics. I believe, from what I have seen in the brief time I have been associated with the Aboriginal community, that by and large that community is angry. I think it feels betrayed by the present Government because it had higher expectations of the Government than perhaps it had of this side of politics when it was in government. The Opposition has not covered itself in glory all the time either. I think the Aboriginal community is fed up with the reports that have gone on interminably, is fed up with people from outside visiting communities-flying in, staying for a couple of hours, flying out again and then writing more reports-and is fed up with white experts; and it wants some action. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately that desire for action to tackle the fundamentals of the problem is not always reciprocated by the white community. That situation will breed Aboriginal activists who will be strident in their cries, which is perfectly understandable. They talk about wanting land rights and control of their own destiny, which I think is understandable and, frankly, not unreasonable. I put it to the non-Aboriginal community: how would we feel had we been conquered in the last world war and our country was still being occupied by the people who took our land by force? Would arguments about how we ran the country before cut any ice in terms of our claims to our land? I do not think we can complain about the attitudes of the Aboriginal community when it makes those strident calls. </PARA>
<PARA> Racism has existed and does exist in Australia, and we need to recognise the role it has played in the history of this country. Unfortunately, racism exists in some of the attitudes still endemic today; we have to acknowledge that problem. The key is that we now need to start to fix some of the problems on the ground and to build up some of the solutions to overcome the disadvantage. That means that we have to do some more meaningful things in health and education and that we must look at the violence and create the jobs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is particularly well worded, and I was struck by the reference of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) to its objectives:</PARA>
<PARA>The object of the establishment of the Council is to promote a process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community, based on an appreciation by the Australian community as a whole of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and achievements and of the unique position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as the indigenous peoples of Australia, and by means that include the fostering of an ongoing national commitment to co-operate to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal community are the indigenous people of this country; and they are disadvantaged. By any objective assessment, past policies have failed. We must now try cooperation by adopting a process of reconciliation to try to address these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) dealt earlier with the main points of the Bill and has indicated the coalition's support for it. He foreshadowed some amendments which, because of the guillotine, I suspect we will not actually get to, but I support his position. The Minister has obviously moved a long way from the original draft of the Bill to try to achieve a truly bipartisan position, for which I congratulate him, as I congratulate the honourable member for Chisholm on the work he has done with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Having achieved this degree of agreement, it is important that we do not now let divisive forces take over. It is important to guard against activists taking over the structure we are now talking about. I can understand their frustration, but they need to recognise that it can be counterproductive. The emphasis must be on community contact and the Council must concentrate on practical outcomes. As has been said before, this Bill sets a level of accountability new to any statutory authority and operates via a strategic plan that will make the Council entirely goal driven, with regular reviews of its own performance, both internally and externally. I think that is commendable. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan will state its goals and objectives, state its strategy for achieving those goals, describe its programs, estimate the cost of the programs, and set out performance indicators and targets; and The Council will prepare a plan every three years and will report annually. The plan will also require the approval of the Minister and, after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, will be laid before both Houses of Parliament; it can be varied only with the approval of the Minister after he or she has consulted with the Leader of the Opposition and then that variation must be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to its strategic plan, the council will be required to report annually on progress towards reconciliation, assess annually its performance against its performance indicators set out in the strategic plan, have its annual report referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, have its annual report tabled in both Houses of Parliament and operate within the limits of the resources made available for its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there is probably little doubt that the preamble to the Bill will upset some people-and I regret to say that it will probably be more on my side of politics than anywhere else-but it seems to me that that preamble is actually a true statement of history. Before I came to this fine country, I served in the Royal Air Force in Britain, and I helped Britain preside over the handing back of some of the finer parts of the world to its original owners. Britain has acknowledged on many occasions that this is the case in various parts of the world, so why should we not also acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> My plea to the non-Aboriginal community is that they now try to approach this whole subject and the reconciliation council with an open mind, to give it a chance, to look into their own souls, and to ask themselves if their community should not do better by the Aboriginal community. I say to the non-Aboriginal community: please do not dismiss the initiative as an attempt to erroneously assuage white guilt or as a comfortable, warm feeling for white middle class intellectuals or as a back-door entry into land rights or whatever-and I have heard those phrases used. I urge that they acknowledge the fact of Aboriginal history at white hands, the demonstrable fact of Aboriginal disadvantage, the fact of failure of past policies and the fact of the actuality of different cultural values. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people are not migrants in this land as we, the white community, would normally use that word. So why not accept that they have a special right to regain their self-respect, their economic independence and social equality with all other Australians in the land of their birth and of their forefathers' birth. I urge the Aboriginal community-and I know it is hard-to be just a little bit more patient. Let us not put the clock back by extreme actions that will only generate a backlash from the non-Aboriginal community. They may take the view that that is not fair, that they should not be asked such a question. They would say to me, `How do you know what it is like?'. Of course, I cannot put myself in their position, but I have some understanding. Over 30 years ago I married a non-Caucasian lady. At the time I was serving in the air force in Britain and such things were not done by British serving officers. I served in that air force for 24 years, and my wife and our children and I have all suffered discrimination in various forms over the years. So I have some understanding, but not a true understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> But things do change, and I say to the Aboriginal community that I believe their situation can be overcome. It must be overcome, but they must do their part. I assure them that there are members in this place, on both sides of the House, who are determined that the situation in which the Aboriginal and the Torres Strait Islander communities find themselves will be corrected in our lifetime. I support the Bill and I hope that the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Chisholm will be accepted by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill to establish the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is not being opposed by the Opposition, despite the fact that its birth has obviously been through a period of considerable suspicion. There has indeed been an atmosphere of concern about what the Government really intended as a result of this legislation. There had been much talk about treaties and specific acts of reconciliation. Those kinds of concepts are not readily accepted by me or many other people on this side of the House. A treaty of itself achieves absolutely nothing to improve the welfare of Aboriginal people. A piece of paper does nothing to enhance the feeling of goodwill between Aboriginals and other Australians. Indeed, there is the real risk that it could create additional division.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The signing of any kind of document implies that there are two different races of people, two different nations, within this one continent, and that is a concept that is not readily accepted by Australians. I am pleased, therefore, that this legislation leaves out almost all references to its objectives being to establish some kind of treaty or particular document and talks much more about improving relationships between black and white. It deals with the tensions which clearly exist currently and, in particular, it deals with methods where perhaps those kinds of tensions can be reduced, and refers particularly to community level consultation. That is where I feel real achievements can in fact occur. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has very meritorious intent. We in the Opposition parties have a real commitment to the welfare of the Australian Aboriginal community and, indeed, all of those who identify with Aboriginal races. But we must be looking towards the achievement of a real objective of one nation, a group of people working together for the benefit of our country. Australia will fully come of age as a multi-racial society only when there are no special provisions for any particular race, no need for special provisions for Aboriginals, no Aboriginal Affairs department, no Abstudy or special settlements; when all Australians are as one, working together with cultural specialities, with particular aims and objectives. Obviously, there are many differences in our outlooks, but we must combine our differences for one benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, over the years, Aboriginals have been abused and used as political pawns by so many sectors of our community, manipulated in many instances by white advisers, often with the very best of intent, often with the objective of doing the best for the people. Aboriginal people have been, over the generations, a very trusting group. They have tended to believe what many people have said to them, even when that has not always been in their best interests. Those people have come from all sides. There have been those, sadly many on the Government payroll, who, rather than help the Aboriginal lot, have fed racial hatred and incited people to make demands which have done nothing whatever to improve the real welfare of Aboriginal people. That is one of the reasons why we talk about reconciliation today. There would be no need for reconciliation if the divisions had not been created in the past. It is most regrettable that people, both white and black and every other colour, have contributed towards the development of those divisions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to say that I represent the people of one of the most excellent Aboriginal communities in Australia, the people of Cherbourg. It is an excellent town with magnificent facilities. It is an excellent example of all that is good in an Aboriginal community but, sadly, also it is an example of many of the things that are bad. It has some very fine leaders like Councillor Les Stewart, who heads the Cherbourg Community Council. It has magnificent facilities-I would venture to say superior to any country town its size anywhere in the country. It has a fine hospital, an aged people's facility, a child-care centre, magnificent schools, and soon even a technical and further education centre. It has an excellent shire council. Recently, the emu farm received an award under the local government achievement awards, and the community includes artists and other people who are contributing to society as a whole. It has much of which to be proud. But, sadly, it also has unemployment, drunkenness, crime and arson. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one of the deaths in custody which were investigated recently occurred in Cherbourg. So it also has its share of strife-much of it, again I am sad to say, stirred up by troublemakers, some of whom have even had training in Cuba, Nicaragua and places like that. Those things have contributed nothing to what is in many ways a model community. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Queensland Government's deed of grant in trust, the community has had title to its land for many years. But as happens in many of these instances, land rights in themselves achieve nothing. The fact that the people have had title to that land has not contributed significantly to the many outstanding achievements in that community, nor has it done anything to redress the social ills that are so apparent. Unfortunately, these days there are many who are choosing to use Aboriginal people with other intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> One very sad example in recent times has been the way in which radical conservationists have endeavoured to mobilise the Aboriginal land rights cause in their own interests. I guess Coronation Hill is an example of that, where the Jawoyn people have been asked to put arguments forward as to why Coronation Hill is a sacred site, despite the fact that Justice Kearney ruled in 1987 that the spiritual affinities of the Jawoyn people ended some 59 kilometres south of that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had an instance in my own electorate in recent times in which some people in the radical conservation movement have tried to use elements of the Batjala people to develop some kind of a claim to Fraser Island. We saw the quite extraordinary action of some of these radical conservation groups signing an accord with people who it was contended were descendants of the Batjalas and claiming some kind of credibility for their claims to that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only a matter of days later that Olga Miller, the recognised chief of the Batjala people, disowned that kind of document. Earlier she had made it quite clear, as a senior elder of those people, a person recognised by all in the community as a lady of great honour and achievement, that the Batjala people had no claims on Fraser Island. Those people have been used by radical conservationists in order to give some kind of credibility to their radical claims. Sadly, that fact has now confirmed by Mr Fitzgerald's inquiry. Those sorts of things are doing a great disservice to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The radicals are not recognised generally by full-blooded Aboriginals, who see them as part white or even less. We have seen Chinese people, Afghan camel drivers and the like trying to make claims on behalf of Aboriginals to particular areas of land. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals do have an affinity with their land, just as I do as a third generation Australian farmer. I have a great affinity with the property that my grandfather settled three generations ago. That is important to me. Such an affinity is important to many Aboriginal people who traverse their land for long periods, and I recognise that type of affiliation, just as I expect other people to recognise my close attachment to my family farm. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognising that, we need to put aside the claims of those whose ancestors left their areas hundreds of years ago and who have now been brought back by people-who perhaps are well meaning in their intentions-to try to claim that they have a deep and long-lasting affiliation with a particular area of land. It is those artificial claims, which can be demonstrated throughout the community to be without substance, that do serious damage to those who are genuinely working in the interests of Aboriginal people and who want to see their reasonable aspirations advanced wherever they possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> Land rights themselves do nothing to improve the Aboriginal lot. Queensland led Australia in the development of deeds of grants in trust. Now we have the political development by the Goss Government of trying to introduce some kind of so-called inalienable freehold title. Of course, there is no such thing. `Inalienable' and `freehold' are contradictory terms; it is either one or the other. The Aboriginal communities have recognised and said publicly-even in their radical demonstrations-that the deed of grant in trust was better for them than what is being proposed today. </PARA>
<PARA> Land rights do nothing to improve health, education, the onset of alcoholism, unemployment or social degradation. They do nothing for the spiritual welfare of people who left their land generations ago; nor will the treaty achieve anything. The only people who really believe they do are the ones who have been listening to white activists trying to convince people that somehow or other a piece of paper or the ability to call a piece of land their own will suddenly cure all their ills. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a responsibility to its Aboriginal people and, indeed, all of those who are in need. Aboriginal development and achievement have been disappointing. Their current status is totally unacceptable to Australians. Ours is a rich country with bountiful resources and we have a responsibility to use them to ensure that all people who live in this country, regardless of their colour, have basic rights, privileges, good health and freedom of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> So it does not achieve anything to throw money, land, or treaties around. What we really need is to show compassion, to understand better health care and, in particular, to encourage self-reliance. Programs such as the community development program have achieved a great deal in that regard. So the consultation process is indeed necessary. We need to bring about reconciliation among all Australians and break down the existing barriers. Whilst the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is a somewhat bureaucratic response, I hope it will at the community level encourage talking and consultation and will achieve a better lot for all Australians as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure to participate in the debate on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill 1991. Earlier this year, it was this Opposition's pleasure to support the Government in its initiatives in the Gulf conflict. Tonight, we have another piece of very critical legislation requiring similar support, in both our national and international interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previous speakers have spoken of the need for bipartisan support for this legislation. While the Opposition will be moving a couple of technical amendments to the legislation, demonstrably we have that necessary bipartisanship in very large measure. Irrefutably that should be the case. Very few reasonable people could argue that our Aboriginal people are not disadvantaged to a greater degree than most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal youth unemployment, for example, stands at about 60 per cent, or twice the national average for unemployed youth generally. The establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, central to this legislation before us, is nevertheless not the panacea to the national disgrace-and that is not too strong a word-that is the lot of our Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> To see it simplistically as such is to hide one's head in the sand. As the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) indicated earlier in this debate, the issues of unemployment, education, housing and health are central to the reversal of the Aboriginals' unfortunate lot in our society today. All of that will take time. However, time is fast running out if we are to make real progress. This Bill and its attendant legislation are simply starting points, albeit critical starting points, in re-establishing the one nation in which all Australians, black, white or brindle, should believe, and in which we should believe fervently, uncompromisingly and without undue apology for the inequities of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us today should not be seen in any way as condoning the need for a formal treaty arrangement between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples of our land. Most importantly, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his recent letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke):</PARA>
<PARA> The process of reconciliation should provide to Aboriginal people the same opportunities that are available to other Australians . . . The process of reconciliation should be devoted to the attainment of specific goals to improve the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people thus ensuring them equality of opportunity and enabling them to play a full part in the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the council should work to establish agreed goals and set annual benchmarks for progress including in housing, health, education particularly literacy, employment opportunities and other infrastructure. This is something ATSIC appears to have difficulty doing to date. </PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a process which improves broad community understanding and Aboriginal self esteem offers the best hope of an environment in which Aboriginal advancement programs will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA>Implicit in this process of reconciliation is a need for the Aboriginal community to understand that it must enjoy the same measure of public accountability referred to by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) earlier as all other elements of our society. We need equality, but it is not in the national interest for any element of our society to be seen to have more than equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in 1988, I raised with the then Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, a number of substantial anomalies in the public accountability of the Darling Downs Aboriginal housing cooperative and its involvement in the former Alma Vale horse stud on the outskirts of Toowoomba in my Queensland electorate. In particular, I was concerned about the high purchase price of nearly $750,000 from public funds and seemingly little earnings return for such a large outlay of taxpayers' money. To the then Minister's credit, he sustained those views and some corrective action was taken in a very short period. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I was informed by concerned members of the local Aboriginal community that there are, once again, major problems in Alma Vale created by elements in the cooperative. I am informed that this facility is now being used to house homeless Aboriginal youth of both sexes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I welcome such initiatives by the Aboriginal community, a number of basic questions, however, need to be answered in several quarters. Firstly, I ask the cooperative: who is supervising such activities? Are they qualified to do so? Are appropriate standards being maintained? Who is funding the initiative? Secondly, I ask the Toowoomba City Council: has the necessary city council approval to vary the official use of this land been given; if not, why not? Thirdly, I ask the Queensland State Minister: has she been consulted on this initiative? Is she satisfied with the facilities provided? What are the funding arrangements involving the Queensland State Government? Fourthly, I ask the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table: is he satisfied that such a variation of land use is an appropriate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission initiative or is he happy to leave such a decision to the local co-op? What degree of scrutiny is he exercising to ensure that public accountability and other standards are being maintained?</PARA>
<PARA> To the Minister's continuing credit and honourable intentions, and having spoken to him briefly about these matters on a couple of occasions this week, I understand that he is now taking ministerial action appropriate to the circumstances. If such an initiative is to be effective to the degree that it deserves, it seems to me that all of these authorities at unofficial, official and ministerial levels need to be swimming in the same direction and in harmony. Unless that is done-it seems to me that sort of process is implicit in the legislation before us this evening-some people can be excused for assuming that we do indeed have a segment of our community which might be receiving more than equal opportunity over and above the due processes of law and social cohesiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my contribution to this debate by saying simply that, unless we can learn to live as one proud undivided nation under one national flag, irrespective of our origins, then we can only fall further behind in maintaining our national and international standing. I reject this legislation, or indeed any other statutory medium, if it is seen as yet another vehicle to national land rights claims. It cannot and must not be seen in such a light by any reasonable person. </PARA>
<PARA> I salute the Aboriginal community in my electorate. I recognise that there is some frustration at a lack of progress in certain quarters. However, I hope that the Aboriginal community will continue to exercise the necessary degree of maturity and patience, rather than resort to the inexcusable behaviour by an unruly element, such as we saw in George Street in Brisbane last week. For many of those and others they have turned the other cheek for too long. However, it should be through the auspices of such legislation as we have before us tonight, rather than through such unwarranted violent action, that a truly equitable solution lies. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Minister and the Government on this legislative initiative as an important first step in ensuring that we maintain our unassailable one country ideals. I commend the Bill and its amendments by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As we are drawing towards the end of this debate, I would like to make a few comments on the course of the debate as I would like to place a few things on the record. They relate to two things: firstly, certain difficulties that have been brought up in the debate; and, secondly, the issue of bipartisanship. The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) said that he was concerned that people in the community have resentment over any notion of inherited guilt; the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) raised issues relating to the Northern Territory Government and, to be fair to him, he also raised issues relating to the Queensland Government; and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) raised concerns about separatism, concerns about a treaty, and concerns about land rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address these issues because it seems to me that these difficulties are at the heart of what the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is trying to go towards. Soon after I was given this job as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs I found-I certainly was not expecting to find this-the degree of entrenched suspicion in Aboriginal affairs very disturbing. It is not just suspicion on one side or the other, but it is suspicion right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give some examples. Some time back, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and asked whether there was some way we could look at food coupons to reduce the problems of alcohol in central Australia. The letter from the Minister for Social Security was really fairly damning, to the effect that we were not going to have anything to do with any scheme like this in any manner or form. Yet, when the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody came out, Commissioner Elliott Johnston actually commended the Tangentyere Council in Alice Springs for the work that it had done in its own food coupon scheme, and suggested that maybe other parts of Australia could look to this as a model to help solve alcohol problems in certain communities.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I got the job of shadow Minister on a Thursday and that afternoon I was phoned by a member of the Northern Territory Government. He said, `There's a big march in Alice Springs against the grog on Saturday; can you make it up?' The very first occasion on which I actually got to consult with a large number of Aboriginal people was at this march. I was incredibly moved to see women of central Australia taking these problems into their own hands and protesting against the effects grog had on their community. I was shocked, quite frankly, to see in the next couple of days people denigrating this march, questioning its authenticity and trying to play down something that had moved me very deeply. Having been there and been part of it I was certain that it was very genuine. </PARA>
<PARA> Just half an hour before this debate started, I received a fax from the Australian Teachers Union which I will read out because it illustrates the point. It is from the President, Di Foggo, who I have not had the pleasure to meet. It criticises me for a press release put out a couple of days ago. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> For you, or any other individual or organisation, to attempt to block bi-partisan support for a process which promises fair representation and consultation . . . is disloyal to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>This was in response to a press release where I had said it was most disappointing that we were not looking at benchmarks, and that the Government had moved away from something it was going to do in the past. I went on to say that I acknowledged the Government had moved substantially to address the Opposition concerns and I would be discussing these matters with my colleagues in the coming weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this not out of any fit of pique but just to illustrate the point that there are stereotypes in this. It is impossible to express something as mild as disappointment without someone on the other side coming out and saying, `We are disgusted that you are trying to block bipartisan support', particularly when I have spent the last six months of my life-I have probably travelled 30,000 kilometres around this country-trying to promote bipartisan support in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It highlights the problems and the suspicion we have in this area because of stereotype views and entrenched attitudes. I found that in some areas the Northern Territory Government has been enormously progressive in Aboriginal affairs, particularly in the area of bilingual Aboriginal education. It was actually the only State or Territory government in the country to support national land rights legislation. I hope that one thing this Council can do is to break down some of those stereotypes on both sides of the political debate and we can perhaps have a little more trust in all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> One honourable member alluded to bipartisanship and said that there was active and constructive discussion. I agree, and as long as the Government wants to address issues concerned with the well-being of Aboriginal people, it will have Opposition support. The Opposition also gives a commitment to the future work of this Council, provided it remains focused and goal-oriented and is delivering something of benefit to Aboriginal people. This legislation is one small step together from both sides of this House. It has involved an element of trust on both sides, which is unusual. I hope we do not all get tied down in the tyranny of words, because we have a real opportunity to go forward. I hope we can take it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In such a wide-ranging debate there are a number of matters to which I would like to respond. I begin by responding first of all to some matters raised by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He put forward in good faith some suggestions for improvements to the Bill. As he would acknowledge, the Government has gone to great lengths to find common ground with the Opposition. I accept that the amendments are put forward in good faith, but unfortunately I cannot accept them. I have in a letter indicated the reason for being unable to do so, and I am inspired by the view and the commitment put forward by the shadow Minister that in no way were those amendments intended to diminish the full commitment of cross-party support given for this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the Government's amendments that have been accepted substantially to accommodate views put forward by the Opposition, I believe that in no way do they diminish the significance and the principles of the legislation. There is a reference added to the preamble which acknowledges that to date there has been no formal process of reconciliation. There is recognition in an amendment of a view of the Opposition that the other side does not wish to have a clause in the legislation that locks it into appointing a serving member of the Parliament. The Government acknowledges that view and the legislation has been amended accordingly. What I would say, however, is that it is important that we keep a dialogue going on this issue, because I very firmly believe that the processes of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be assisted by keeping in touch with the Parliament and ensuring that we continue to remain on common ground. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further amendment that it is important to emphasise, and that is the continuing community focus the Opposition has put forward in relation to the Bill. The Government passionately believes that ought to be part and parcel of the process and, therefore, we have no hesitation in accepting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a number of things in the six minutes remaining to me. I have to think: what do I say to the shadow Minister when, like him, I left my room to attend this debate, which came on some 40 or 50 minutes prior to the expected time? It is one of the few pieces of legislation that passes through the second reading stage of the House of Representatives and then happens again once more with feeling. It is a demonstration of our mutual commitment that we did want to make this a substantial debate, and there is no question that it has been just that. </PARA>
<PARA> In public life there are probably all too few opportunities when people are able to be in the right place at the right time and, by virtue of the convergence of circumstances, are able to affect the outcome of an important issue. The shadow Minister is fortunate, as am I, to have been elected to the Federal Parliament and particularly fortunate that we happened to be allocated the responsibilities of Aboriginal affairs in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister's role, as the honourable member for Chisholm, has been one of behaving throughout this entire process with total integrity, with a very genuine and, I believe, heartfelt commitment to what all of us have been trying to achieve in this process. It has not been easy because we have realised that we have to ensure that the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are listened to; that we have to be conscious that the Australian Democrats have a role in this process; and that we have to deal with our own parties. It has been truly an enormous task we have undertaken, but it is one that I think has been brought to fruition. We will see when the Bill passes through the Senate, but I have every confidence that it will. I want to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the personal contribution made by the shadow Minister, and I think we should all welcome and acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things were said in the course of this debate: by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney); by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls); by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon); by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall); by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson); by the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent)-who, I might say, made an outstanding contribution; by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and I ought to say that I did disagree with a great many things he said, but it is true to say that his comments reminded us of the need for this public awareness and public education process, and to that extent I am indebted to him for his contribution; and by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who also raised some specific matters to which I will respond formally. Time will not enable me to comment in detail about those individual contributions. However, I want to thank the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for giving up his opportunity to speak in this debate in order to allow me to make these remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining minutes I would like to say some thankyous to people who deserve enormous appreciation for their contribution: to Lois O'Donoghue, the chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the ATSIC commissioners; to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who in the course of this process has allowed me carriage of the matter and has never failed in his commitment to ensure that we reached the conclusion we are reaching today; to my Caucus colleagues, my true believer friends, who have remained firm and staunch in the course of this debate and in the process; to all the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have shaped my life and, indeed, shaped this very process that is before the House; to my trusted friends and confidantes, some of whom are in the public gallery and who have worked with me from day one in trying to find the common ground; to the Opposition, as I have already indicated; to the Australian Democrats, who have also from day one never faltered in giving their support to this process; and-something I have never done before-to my own staff, who put up with, to use a phrase of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), my manic determination to ensure that this Bill got through the House on a unanimous basis. I thank them all. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, in the very limited time available to me, I want to encapsulate what this Bill means to me. I, like others in this place, both Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal, am very proud to be Australian. We have an incredible, wonderful country, although one that is far from perfect, as all the contributions to this debate have made absolutely clear. If there is one issue that above all else looms large as one to be tackled as we move to that centenary of Federation, it is this issue of reconciliation and justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I say in absolute conclusion that this process we are embarking upon is one that is intrinsically Australian, one based on recognition of the essential dignity of humankind, the elimination of racism, the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as Australia's indigenous people, and a commitment to a fair go for Australia's most disadvantaged people. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I table the further explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address, firstly, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. It has two sections: one relates to nursing homes and one relates to a number of health matters. I will, firstly, address the clauses which relate to nursing homes in terms of the amendments to the National Health Act. This part of the Bill contains provisions which enable much more information about nursing homes to be made publicly available. These changes will enable three further categories of information to be released directly to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of those categories relates to action plans prepared by a nursing home indicating how the home will be improved so as to meet prescribed standards of care. Action plans apply to homes that have been found not to meet the standards and are the proprietor's indication of the changes which will be made in the practices of that home. This provision poses no problem to the vast majority of nursing homes, because quality care has always been and will remain the pursuit of all responsible persons and parties to the nursing home and hostel system. However, it is regrettable that insufficient funding in the present construction of the standard aggregate module is endangering the financial viability of the industry as a whole and putting undue stress on proprietors and nursing staff in their endeavours to care for our frail elderly. This provision will also answer, following the publication of an outcomes report, the home's intention to deal with matters. At present, with publication of the inspection report only, matters of non-compliance are often left up in the air as to how a proprietor intends to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second provision relates to basic descriptive information concerning each nursing home, such as its name, address, numbers of beds, fees charged, et cetera. These can now be published. Some concern has been expressed that this seemingly innocuous provision is full of hidden dangers. There is some anxiety about possible bias by bureaucrats against the private enterprise sector in making public, in any way that the Secretary sees fit, any or all relevant information. This could, in fact, have an immense effect upon the financial viability of the business, particularly in those geographical areas where there are higher than average bed vacancies. Occupancy clearly has a major impact on the financial viability of a nursing home, and the unchecked comments of a bureaucrat are completely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that an appeals mechanism is available to a proprietor who is not satisfied that all the information has been made public without bias, but I seek reassurance from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) that the departmental officers and the geriatric assessment teams will be instructed not to favour one home or another in giving out information of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue is the information which will be released directly to the public on action taken, or intended to be taken, to suspend or revoke the approval of a nursing home, to vary the conditions of its approval, to cease benefits for new admissions or to remove or vary exempt status. Again, there is concern that the sanction of ceasing payment of benefits to new admissions to a home can only cause standards of a home to drop even further. It has been pointed out that the present funding arrangements allow for optimum viability of homes only when more than 98 per cent occupancy is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> If funding is denied to new residents, while occupancy levels will be maintained, in fact, funding will be appropriate only to occupancy levels of those residents still receiving benefits. Therefore, only one result can occur: the funding intended for existing residents will have to be spread over all residents and, of course, standards will drop. Problems will result in the work force of the home as payments of wages would be jeopardised, causing interference by relevant trade unions and, potentially, industrial courts. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand from the Department of Community Services and Health that such action will be taken only in drastic circumstances and that an appeals mechanism is available to the proprietor. Again I seek the Minister's assurance on this matter. I also seek confirmation that an appeals mechanism is available prior to the publication of information about ministerial action and other information about approved nursing homes. Subject to these assurances being given, the Opposition supports these amendments to the National Health Act. We also support the technical amendments to the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the health related issues in this legislation, there are some changes which are relatively minor but still significant and which the Opposition will support. For example, the definition of `a professional service' under the Health Insurance Act will be clarified by this legislation so that Medicare benefits can be claimed for a service only where a physical attendance on the patient occurs and a clinically relevant service also takes place. This effectively closes a loophole which has been exploited by some members of the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Part V of the Bill contains amendments to introduce a scheme which allows sponsors of therapeutic goods to pay their evaluation fees by instalments when applying to register their goods under the Therapeutic Goods Act. Similarly, there are also amendments which deal with the introduction of fees similar to those payable under the Freedom of Information Act for processing the information in the Australian register of therapeutic goods and making it available to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more forward looking changes relates to decentralisation of the individual patient usage (IPU) scheme, which has been in operation for a number of years. It was intended to cover situations where drugs which are not normally available in Australia-usually because they have not been marketed-may be used by individual doctors to treat individual patients in given circumstances. The usual sequence of events is that, in a situation where a physician feels that a particular therapeutic product, usually a pharmaceutical product, is necessary for the well-being of his patient and there is no viable, acceptable alternative, he has to make an approach to the therapeutic goods department, and its medical officer in Canberra will assess each individual request for an IPU and determine whether or not it is to be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> As could be imagined, this is a very cumbersome procedure. It was cumbersome at the best of times when there were very few IPU requests. I understand that the number of IPUs is now approaching 20,000 per year. Clearly the problem is going to increase, and the suggestion of the Minister, which is to be implemented by this legislation, is that the IPU scheme will be decentralised so that the decision will be made by individual medical officers in various hospitals to undertake effectively the same decision as is currently made by the Commonwealth medical officers in Canberra in the therapeutic goods administration. I understand that the guidelines will be much the same as at present, but certainly it will allow a greater flexibility and, presumably, will end up as a more sensible solution to what is an ongoing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason there are so many requests for IPUs is that a large number of therapeutic products, mainly pharmaceuticals, are not available in Australia. The reason they are not available in Australia is, by and large, a result of restrictions in the approval process for those products. Those restrictions have reached a level where they are acting as a deterrent to pharmaceutical companies to introduce products into Australia. Already there are difficulties because of the pricing structure in Australia, which is significantly lower than most other world markets. There is also a major deterrent in the fact that the red tape-the bureaucracy which has to be gone through-is much worse here than in most other comparable advanced countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In this House before I have illustrated some of the problems which face pharmaceutical manufacturers. The problem is a very real and a very large one. It is because there is a deterrent to pharmaceutical companies to introduce drugs into Australia at an early stage in their development when, in many cases, there are no alternative drugs available that the IPU system has been widely used. It should be a safety valve for the occasional situation where the optimal drug is not available in Australia. The fact that there are now 20,000 approvals is an indictment of the system of drug approval in Australia which has deterred so many pharmaceutical companies from seeking approval for their particular product. </PARA>
<PARA> I was only too well aware of this in my alter ego as an oncologist prior to entering Parliament when there were a number of well proven pharmaceutical products which, for one reason or other, had not been approved for general marketing in Australia. Looking down the list which is in front of me now, I see that there are at least half a dozen drugs that have been around for a considerable length of time on the IPU list which clearly have no place on that list. They are drugs which are well recognised as being very valuable in the treatment of a number of malignant diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> If I look outside the cancer area in pharmaceuticals, there is an even longer list of drugs which should be approved by this administration but which have not been. On the cancer list, there are drugs such as bulsulphan, which, if I remember rightly, was introduced in 1955 and has been regularly used as a treatment of choice for chronic myeloid leukaemia ever since. Ifosphamide is one of the drugs of choice for a number of odd carcinomas. Hexamethlymelamine is a very valuable drug. Mesna, pentostatin, fludarabine and 4-Hydroxy Androsteinedione are all drugs which should be available in Australia and at present are only available in this crazy restricted fashion on the IPU. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Government's move to decentralise the IPU system, but I urge the Government to take steps to rectify the basic problem. What it is doing is, to a large extent, only a bandaid. It should solve the problem by making sure that products which are on the IPU at present which should not be there are taken off and made appropriately available. That is certainly the case in the majority of these drugs which I have been discussing today. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that problem, we have no difficulty with the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. Most of these changes are sensible. They impose no extra undue costs on either the industry or on individuals or consumers. Overall, there should be a decrease in the bureaucracy associated with these procedures. Subject to seeking the assurances mentioned earlier regarding nursing homes, we will support this Bill as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill we are discussing is the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1991. This briefly makes a number of amendments to part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. They result from problems that we and the Australian Democrats had with the original Therapeutic Goods Act passed earlier this year. This was an example of a Bill being passed at a time when the Government recognised that it was flawed and recognised that it would have to introduce amendments to resolve those flaws. These are some of the flaws which were pointed out at that time. They relate basically to the grouping of therapeutic goods where they share common characteristics and a common manufacturer and some alteration to the charges relating to those groups so that each individual group is subject to a charge for registration and inspection rather than each individual therapeutic item. Again, this should reduce the bureaucracy and the charges to manufacturers. We will support this Bill also. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I am happy to point out that we are taking yet again a bipartisan approach in some of these matters to ensure that the collective health of Australia is indeed improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill that are before the House this evening. I note the comments of the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) about the Opposition's support for the Bills before us. In his comments on the Bill dealing with nursing homes, the support was somewhat qualified, particularly in the area of his concern that proprietors of nursing homes should have their rights spelt out perhaps more clearly than he suggested was the case in this legislation. The fundamental thing to say about that is that these provisions provide for an important further step in the Government's real commitment to ensure that the residents of nursing homes are paramount in the well-being of the whole of the aged care services. That is an important step because it is long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, in the past all too often residents of nursing homes were allowed to go there, often with very little information-in many cases, misinformation-and very often the quality of care that should be a fundamental ingredient was left on the back-burner as the pursuit of profits and economic interests on the part of nursing home proprietors became the paramount consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, this Government-particularly added to in the measures before the House-is determined to ensure that residents of nursing homes and the overall quality of nursing home care is strong and is conducive to a quality aged care policy commitment. That is very much a hallmark of what this Government stands for. We have made it a priority that aged care should be a comprehensive policy provision. We recognise that in many cases nursing home care is an important component of that. It is not in all cases. One would hope that before families reach the conclusion that nursing home care is the appropriate accommodation for aged relatives they have the chance to consider all the available options and to consider whether there were other appropriate options in terms of community care that could be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Many families reach the conclusion that nursing home accommodation is essential. The provisions contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill will ensure that basic rights are spelt out very clearly and will ensure that some of the difficulties that have arisen as a result of the provisions of privacy and secrecy relating to nursing home arrangements do not stand in the way of people who may be going into nursing homes having full details about costings and other arrangements that will affect them vitally in their future years. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality of aged care is critical. I have been to a number of nursing homes in my electorate over the last 12 months. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) has visited two or three of them as well. Only recently, he opened extensions to one of the major nursing homes that exists in the electorate of Parramatta. It is very pleasing to see the way improvements are being undertaken, particularly in the area of dementia care, which has been one of the areas to which the Government has devoted attention as part of its overall aged care commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to this Bill enable the Department to make crucial information available to the public without in any way compromising the rights of residents to privacy and the nursing home proprietor's right to have commercial information remain confidential. A noteworthy feature of the Government's aged care policies has been to enable older people to make their own decisions about the care they need. Freedom of choice underlies all the Government's policies in this area. The whole philosophy of the charter of residents rights and responsibilities is to empower the nursing home resident to take his or her own decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to the ability to make an informed decision is the provision of information. Surely, no-one could argue that point. It is impossible to make an appropriate decision about available options for aged care without all available information. This Government is concerned to ensure that older people and their families are well aware of the choices available to them when they seek that help. These choices include whether to seek additional help to care for the person at home; whether to approach a geriatric assessment service for an assessment; and whether to consider hostel or nursing home admission. If nursing home admission is recommended, then the family needs to know more about the range and availability of services. They need to know things such as location of nursing home services and more details about fees that are charged and services provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing secrecy provisions of the National Health Act have unfortunately restricted the ability of the Government to properly inform residents of nursing homes, their relatives and the rest of the community about care provided in nursing homes. As well, the Act has restricted the dissemination of information concerning action taken by the Government against nursing homes which are not providing appropriate care. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) referred to this and expressed concern about the all-embracing nature of those provisions. Surely it is the right of the community at large, where very serious problems are identified in terms of the quality of care, the nature of the facility and how it is being maintained, to be aware of those issues in making their decisions about future movements into a particular establishment. They are very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Several amendments are proposed to the National Health Act which will significantly strengthen the effect of the regulatory program of standards monitoring in nursing homes. Again, that is a provision that people can reasonably see as a positive step forward. The nursing home outcome standards, established by the Government in 1987, emphasise the importance of residents as individuals and members of the community. The standards set out the care and lifestyle objectives which the nursing home industry is expected to achieve for all residents. Surely, again, that is a provision that the people at large would want to see. The whole community shares the concern and objective of wanting to ensure that all residents of nursing homes do have quality of care, that comprehensive services are provided and that the residents are not allowed to be just left and forgotten as has occurred, sadly, in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards focus on the outcomes for residents, as it has been found that monitoring of inputs or processes alone cannot guarantee that residents have a high quality of life and care. The standards represent a significant change in the way that government perceives nursing homes and the care of the aged in general. In the past, regulations and legislation have primarily addressed the inputs to care and the physical environment of nursing homes rather than the quality of care and the lifestyle of residents affected by them. Outcome standards also recognise the changing perception of nursing homes as being the long term home of residents as well as health care facilities, and by not specifying inputs or processes, the standards encourage flexibility in nursing home design, service provision and work practices. The intent of the standards is also to encourage and enable residents to perform activities, maintain responsibilities and receive support according to their individual needs and capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Owing to the increasing frailty of residents in nursing homes, it is recognised that not all residents will be able to avail themselves fully of freedoms which are available and utilised by some, and which are properly theirs. However, this is not a reason for withdrawing or qualifying the quality of service that is provided for the majority of residents in those nursing homes. As part of the Government's residents rights strategy and intention to ensure that information about nursing homes is widely available, the Government publishes reports of its visits to nursing homes and age hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> However, some parts of the National Health Act unnecessarily restrict the provision of available information in these areas to the public. Those restrictions make it difficult to inform the public about action that a proprietor is taking to meet the standards, any action the Minister is taking in relation to homes providing a poor quality of service, and any information on homes that have closed. Existing legislation prevents the publication of a standards monitoring report once a home has closed-again, an undesirable consequence addressed by these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the legislation will allow publication of standards monitoring reports prepared on visits undertaken before the closure. I also emphasise that the proprietor will still be given at least 30 days in which to comment on the report prior to its publication. That was one point raised by the honourable member for Lowe which is actually contained within the Bill. The proposed amendments also allow the Government to release information in regard to details of action that the Government has taken or intends to take in relation to sanctions and a nursing home's condition of approval. The Government will allow proprietors 30 days in which to comment on these statements, except in circumstances where there is an urgent need to release information to protect the welfare or interests of persons who are or who may become residents of the nursing home in the immediate future. I am sure honourable members would agree that that is a fairly sensible provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise also that the spirit of the proposed amendments reflect the Government's concern that residents of nursing homes receive care of the highest quality. Inherent in this responsibility is the need to inform people who have a vested interest in aged care-residents, their relatives, State Government agencies and industry bodies-of action that the Government has taken or is taking. It is inappropriate that the proprietor can decide not to inform residents and prospective residents of any sanctions action being taken by the Commonwealth. The ability of the Commonwealth to release this information will ensure that residents and relatives are fully informed of what is happening to their home. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions are sensible arrangements because they ensure that the quality of care that residents deserve, and rightly seek in the current age, will be maintained and adhered to. The action that the Government has taken over recent times to ensure the quality of aged care is something that the community now recognises and appreciates. Fortunately, we have much less emphasis on the sorts of very negative and damning exposes that we have often seen in the media in the past about nursing homes that were very poorly maintained, where the quality of care was appalling and where residents were being treated very much as lepers in an institution and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been very vigilant in ensuring that those sorts of stories are matters of past history, and that residents of nursing homes now receive quality care treatment. I have no doubt that those measures are an important further step in what is, as I say, this Government's very strong and abiding commitment to quality aged care policies. We have demonstrated that commitment in terms of policy provision across the whole range of services that the aged desire and need in our community. It is one that will go down, when the decade of the 1980s is written up, as something that ensured that quality aged care and the needs and services for the aged were really put on both the public agenda and the Government's priority agenda. Very strong measures have been taken, particularly in the provision of nursing home services, with respect to the extension of the quality of those nursing home services, and this Government rightly deserves great credit for its achievements in this field. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendments Bill implements a number of proposals, most of which were outlined in the 1990 Budget, and, to a certain extent, follows the agreement between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government on restructuring of the pharmacy profession. The basic thrust, which the Opposition entirely supports, is to reduce fraudulent access to pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill falls broadly into three areas. The first is that it defines those who are eligible to receive pharmaceutical benefits scheme benefits and restricts those to Australian residents or specially approved persons, broadly bringing eligibility for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme into line with the eligibility for the Medicare card. Clearly, we support this part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill provides for a checking mechanism to see whether individuals who seek pharmaceutical benefits are, in fact, eligible for those benefits. In general terms, there are two groups that the Bill would be looking at: one is those who are resident in Australia and, therefore, eligible in general terms; and the other is those who are eligible under the concessionary entitlements-pensioners and the like-who are now able to receive drugs at the subsidised $2.50 charge rather than at the maximum $15 charge. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a number of problems with this part of the Bill. Firstly, the checking procedure is effectively compulsory for all pharmacists. The reason for this is that, although it is not compulsory de facto, it will involve pharmacists who do not undertake this checking mechanism, and who subsequently find that some of the claims were not genuine, in a financial penalty. Unless they check, pharmacists run the risk of being financially penalised. Clearly, the end result is to make this a compulsory checking mechanism. Sadly, it makes pharmacists into policemen for the Health Insurance Commission (HIC). This is a role which is entirely foreign to their current view, which is that they are professional advisers on health to the community and dispensers and checkers of pharmaceutical products and other products. Quite clearly, that is a major issue with the pharmacy profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question about the checking mechanism is whether it will actually achieve the savings which the Government claims it will achieve. The estimates of the Government's potential savings in full years are some $40m. We in the Opposition are trying very hard to find out how the Government has reached this figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer seems to be that the Government has taken from the Auditor-General's report an error rate-that is, people who falsely received pharmaceutical benefits-which is slightly more than 5 per cent, and it has taken an error rate from a small sample of its own. It looked at slightly more than 1,000 scrips to see how many of those were incorrectly given subsidised benefits. I think the figure in that survey was some 3 1/2 per cent. The Government then said, `Okay, we will take a middle figure'. It seems to me that just plucking a figure out of the air-which is what the Government is really doing-is a crazy way of trying to work out what the savings to government are going to be. That is the potential saving. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government admits to costs of around $15m or $16m per annum. Basically, those costs relate to the cost of leasing the equipment and leasing the telephone lines. The equipment involved seems to be a swipe machine to run credit cards through-in this case, the Medicare card-together with a keyboard and some sort of screen on which to receive messages from the Health Insurance Commission computer, which is presumably based in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the actual costs which are mentioned in the document. There are a lot of costs which are not mentioned in the document. The legislation seems to conveniently forget that there are a number of other expenditures involved. It does not cost, for example, the work involved by the pharmacists. If, in fact, a Medicare swipe card-one of the new magnetic Medicare cards-is going to be acceptable to swipe through the individual's identification (ID), then the extra time involved for the pharmacist is fairly minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it seems that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) is completely confused about whether that will be enough by itself, or whether, for example, the numbers of pensioner's concession cards would have to be entered manually in order to access eligibility information. The Minister was apparently unable to answer that question yesterday. It seems to me to be a sorry state of affairs when the Minister does not understand how the legislation is going to implement a particular procedure. Nonetheless, that seems to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there are going to be problems with the costs of entering extra data. Even if we assume that everybody in the country has a Medicare card with a magnetic strip on the back that can be swiped through very quickly and conveniently, the facts of the matter are, clearly, that a number of people, when they come to the pharmacy for their scrip, will, for one reason or another, not have their Medicare card with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us assume that that figure is one in 10. If one in 10 scrips actually need to have the ID of the individual-that is, name, address and, if appropriate, a social security number-entered in manually, then what are the costs involved? At present, the Health Insurance Commission offers that as a service to pharmacists who want to bill their patients via the HIC bureau. The HIC-which is doing this, I must point out, on a massive scale and therefore has a reduction in costs associated with the scale-charges 22c per entry, per scrip. If one in 10 scrips are unaccompanied by a Medicare swipe card-even assuming that everybody has a Medicare swipe card-then the cost involved, the 22c per scrip, amounts to several million dollars again. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pharmacy Guild estimates that potential extra costs to the scheme, which will initially be borne by the pharmacists, are some $12m just for entry alone. If one associates that with an interview of the patient to see whether he or she is the person he or she claims to be and also has to discuss some of the other matters related to this legislation, the Guild claims that, conservatively, the extra costs will be some $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> We must understand, of course, that if that is the case then the pharmacists are not going to be keen to bear that cost themselves. The next time a tribunal examines the remuneration of the pharmacy profession, we could bet our bottom dollar that there will be a claim in there for a minimum of $12m extra. It may well go much higher, in line with the $60m. If we get that and we are trying to save a potential total of $40m-which, at best, is rather dubious anyway-then we have to ask ourselves whether the sums add up. </PARA>
<PARA> We can also add in a number of other factors, such as the fact that, even if the Medicare cards are used as ID, we have to bear in mind that there are at present some 17 million Medicare cards. Another 9 million of the new magnetic Medicare cards are being issued; but, at the same time, the other 17 million cards are not being withdrawn. We have a potential 26 million cards for a population in Australia of some 17 million people. Clearly, there are a number of cards floating around which are not going to be necessarily held by the person who should be holding them. For example, my own wife has three Medicare cards. She got a Medicare card for herself. When we had our first baby, she got another one and when she had her second baby she was sent another one-without asking for it. I hasten to add that I think my wife is entirely trustworthy and that these will not be used in a fraudulent manner. Nonetheless, there are other people in society who may not be so scrupulous and who may, as has been made clear, sell their Medicare cards on the black market, where they are used both to obtain scrips from doctors and services from doctors and also, presumably, potentially to obtain extra pharmaceutical benefits to which they are not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, this system will not stop people borrowing a friend's card-if the friend happens to be a pensioner, for example-and using that to obtain the pharmaceutical benefits. The whole problem is exacerbated when there is no destruction of outdated Medicare cards. I urge the Government, as I have in other fora, to make sure that the whole system is tightened up. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other questions. Clearly there are doubts about potential savings, there are doubts about the costs involved in achieving those savings, and there are also doubts about whether, even if the costs are negligible, the identification program as planned will result in true savings by eliminating fraud. We have major doubts about all these issues. As a result, we would make sure that we refer clause 7 and clause 11, which provide access to the Commission's computer system, to the appropriate Senate to investigate whether the financial considerations are such that the legislation will result in savings to the Government, and also whether the safeguards for privacy are adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the next problem: what happens to the privacy information? We have had concerns since the program was first announced last August that there was a potential for misuse. For example, the information that will be entered will include two types of information. From the Medicare card, of course, there will be access to individuals' Medicare rebates and therefore the types of services that are offered, such as operations or even abortions. From the PBS information now entered there will be information about their pharmaceutical history-for example, whether they have been receiving psychiatric treatment in terms of pharmaceutical drugs. Potentially, of course, if we marry those, there is a lot of very personal and private information available. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand there have been assurances that that will not be the case, that the databases will not be matched. We are happy to accept that. On the other hand, we are concerned that there is no mention of this in the legislation. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner has issued a number of guidelines. I have seen those guidelines and in principle I am happy with them, but I would be much happier if that privacy question were addressed within the legislation. It is a vitally important matter, particularly if that sort of information is being matched with social security numbers, which in turn are matched to tax file numbers, however indirectly that may be at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also provides for other issues to be addressed. For example, if the individual patient is not eligible, which most commonly would relate to somebody coming from overseas, then the question arises as to what the pharmacist charges. The information we received from the Minister initially was that he would be allowed to charge market prices, that is, whatever was appropriate in a given situation. In fact, of course, that is the correct approach. Clearly there should be an allowance for pharmacists to charge whatever is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this legislation does not say that. This legislation says that the price the pharmacist can charge for non-eligible patients under the PBS is limited to the Commonwealth price. There is no reason for that whatsoever. The only possible reason, which is somewhat far fetched, is that if the HIC computer in Canberra makes a mistake and somebody is deemed to be ineligible who subsequently proves to be eligible, then the Government may have to pay more to match up to the market price to fill in the gap than it would if it matched up to the Commonwealth price. Apart from that, there is no reason for this whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say, to be blunt about it, that it is pure socialism. There is no justification for imposing these sorts of restraints upon a free market, which is what we are actually talking about in terms of the pharmaceutical products for people who come from overseas, for a product which is not subsidised by the Government in any way and which the pharmacist is not subsidised to dispense. There can be no justification for imposing this cap upon the amount the pharmacist is allowed to charge. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other provisions in the legislation that make it essential, in fact compulsory, for pharmacists to utilise the computerised claims transmission system (CTS) to submit their dispensing claims. With a few exemptions, such as those in isolated pharmacies or those with power supply difficulties, it will be compulsory for every pharmacy to install a computer and use the CTS system. Let me say at the beginning that I understand this is obviously a very efficient system, efficient not only for the HIC but also, by and large, for most pharmacies, except where they happen to be very small. I have to say that I think most sensible pharmacists would choose to use this particular system. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there is a difference between what may be sensible and this imposition, this requiring of pharmacists who may not want to purchase a computer and the appropriate software-I understand the costs involved are around $10,000-when in their own judgment it may not be appropriate. This clearly would apply in particular to a number of individuals who may have a small turnover of pharmaceutical products. That element of compulsion is abhorrent to us, even though it may be a sensible thing on a market basis for the pharmacist to do. </PARA>
<PARA> We have received legal advice that the compulsion to use the CTS is ultra vires in terms of the Government, and also that the imposition of a 22c charge, which is what the Government plans for those people who have to use the Health Insurance Commission bureau to enter their data, is also beyond the power of the Government to impose. So it will be interesting to see whether that stands up to any challenge that may be instituted by the Pharmacy Guild. I mention in passing that the Pharmacy Guild now does have major concerns about the extra workload involved in this pharmaceutical benefits legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow that, on the basis of what I have discussed, we will move a number of amendments. We will, for example, oppose clause 10 (2) (b), which limits the amount pharmacists can charge for non-benefits items. We will oppose clause 14, which makes it compulsory to submit claims via the CTS. As I mentioned, we will refer clause 7 and clause 11 to the appropriate Senate committee to investigate both the financial aspects and the privacy aspects of the checking system. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also move an amendment so that determinations by the Minister become disallowable by adding to clause 17, which relates to instruments that are disallowable, any determination under subsection 98c (1) of the National Health Act. This is a similar amendment to that which has been foreshadowed by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in relation to another aspect of this same Bill. It ensures that determinations by the Minister become disallowable and therefore are placed under the scrutiny of Parliament, as, of course, is only right and fair. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say in summary that whilst we support the thrust of this legislation we have major doubts about whether it will achieve its financial objectives. We do object to some of the compulsion elements in the legislation and the fact that pharmacists are not only being used to perform extra unpaid work but are also being forced to act as policemen for the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I also thank the Opposition for its support of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991, even though it is a little qualified and does contain some foreshadowed amendments. The changes spelled out in the Bill before the House tonight and foreshadowed in the industry statement in March are another example of this Government's commitment to micro-economic reform. The changes spelled out by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in his second reading speech demonstrate the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to revise, to refine and to reform not only in the interests of Australia as a whole but also in the interests of individual Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions in this Bill are a good example of what this Government is all about. People on the other side of the House are always shouting about not saving money, yet the provisions of this Bill exemplify what is happening all the time. The Minister has pointed out the savings that will accrue to this nation from the implementation of these changes. The $40m saving for the Australian community is $40m that can be applied to a better use in the interests of all Australians in other areas. The $40m a year saved is like putting in a plug to stop a great leak-in this case the waste of taxpayers' resources by the prescribing and giving of concessions to people who should not be entitled to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about changes that will prevent people receiving concessions to which they are not entitled at cost to Australian taxpayers. Of course, the objection will be made that people will be frightened and intimidated by the changes, and I think some of the comments of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), alluded to this situation. I am not sure that some of his comments did not add to it as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has always pointed out there is no big deal; pharmacists do not have to use the on-line facilities. In many cases, probably in most, the chemists will know the people they are dealing with and will know their genuineness, so will not have to run identity checks to allow them to access the system. The scheme to be introduced protects both the honest customer, the pharmacist and Australian taxpayers from being ripped off. Already I have heard comment from the other side that the Bill discriminates against the elderly and the infirm. That is absolute rubbish. Firstly, the elderly and the infirm are those most likely to be known by their pharmacist. Secondly, the Bill refers not just to one group but to all those who seek benefits and concessions. Thirdly, such a claim is patronising senior citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> There have always been, and always will be, changes, and these changes will affect both young and old. People do cope and will cope. Their biggest hurdle is often to overcome the disinformation fed to them by pressure groups for their own political and sometimes financial gain. There have been and will be big changes implemented in our society in pursuit of better services and the targeting of those most in need, and in the interest of seeing that taxpayers are not ripped off by the unscrupulous and the dishonest. People will understand that these changes, like others before them, are for the good of the community, and they will accept them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has provided safeguards so that people's privacy is completely safeguarded. The privacy issues raised by any checking procedure must remain of concern to us all. We all need to remain vigilant to ensure that the privacy of ordinary Australians is completely safeguarded from unscrupulous people who would use information for their own advantage. The Government has taken the privacy issues in this matter very seriously. That is why it has taken such a long time to work through the processes. The provisions of the Bill now ensure that at the point of supply the pharmacist will be provided with a tool that will guarantee payment and provide sufficient information to know that and no more. The Privacy Commissioner has indicated that he is satisfied that both the customer and the information are completely safeguarded by the present provisions spelled out in the Bill now before the House. I have great faith in the pharmacists of this country. Like general practitioners, they always look after their people. A recent announcement indicates that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia is now working with the Government to implement the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, this Bill contains a very simple proposal. Through a simple mechanism, a pharmacist will use a Medicare card, a name or a Department of Social Security number to establish eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits. The Health Insurance Commission will immediately throw up one of four responses: the patient is entitled to free benefits; the patient is to be charged at the concessional rate; the patient is to be charged at the general rate; or the patient is not recorded. In many cases, if not most, the pharmacists may not even choose to check because they know their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is adamant that patients would receive their full entitlements-no more and no less. It has been argued elsewhere that, where a customer is not entitled to a pharmaceutical benefit, chemists should be able to charge whatever they like. That is not possible under this scheme. The shadow Minister for social security in his address also pointed this out. He made the great disclaimer that it was socialism at its best. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his comment. The price for a no-benefit prescription is limited to the price of the drug, plus a 10 per cent mark up and a dispensing fee. Under the provisions of this Bill the pharmacist is precluded from charging private prescription rates. These provisions are not put in place to protect the hapless American or Japanese tourist, but to protect those in our society who are powerless and perhaps inarticulate and confused and who walk into a pharmacy and are not able to establish their eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits. The price they pay will be limited to the price for which the pharmacist is guaranteed payment by the Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill will save the taxpayers of Australia real money. Taxpayers have a right to expect that from a government which is committed to micro-economic reform in the interests of this nation. To oppose such reform is not only to oppose a Budget initiative, but is also to condone the bleeding away of scarce dollars by people who think it is okay to rip off money because it only comes from the Government. I ask the Opposition, when it moves its amendments to this Bill in its qualified support, to consider that the Australian taxpayers are entitled to know where their money is going and that the Government is responsible for handling those funds on behalf of the Australian taxpayers and people in need. </PARA>
<PARA> When one walks into a financial institution to obtain funds, it is a simple fact that one is required to have some degree of identification. It is only fair that the Government, in assuring the people of Australia that it is responsibly handling the finances of this nation, also expects people, when they walk into a pharmacy to obtain benefits provided at cost to other Australian taxpayers, clearly identify themselves to ensure that the benefit they receive from being resident in this great country is handled responsibly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I presented to the Parliament a petition bearing some 250 signatures calling on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Authority to place hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the free list. While the exact number of women affected cannot accurately be calculated, medical practitioners number them in the thousands or tens of thousands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I very much fear that I am getting ahead of myself: I wish to tell a story about a particular concern with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) by way of an excellent letter written by one of my constituents, Mrs Gail Liddell, of Longford in Gippsland, which she asked me to forward to Mr Brian Howe, as the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health. I have advised Mrs Liddell that Minister Howe is almost certain to pass on her concerns regarding the PBS to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who has more direct responsibility under the ministerial arrangements for this area. I had best read into the Hansard Mrs Liddell's letter because it sets out so well the background and the problems being encountered in regard to hormone replacement therapy. The letter is addressed to Brian Howe:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr. Howe,</PARA>
<PARA>It is with increasing concern that I write to you as Minister for Health concerning the anomaly that currently exists in the essential availability of hormone replacement implants for women in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is a sensitive subject but public ignorance of its application has compounded the issue and perhaps prevented health authorities from making an informed decision as to HRT implants being available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits free listing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>From previous enquiries, much confusion and deferral has occurred between the P.B.A. and the manufacturer `Organon' with the ultimate result leaving the consumer frustrated and locked into a `Catch 22' situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, let me summarise the need for HRT in the form of implants:-</PARA>
<PARA>For a woman's body to function normally following surgical procedure to remove her reproductive system (complete hysterectomy/oophorectomy), replacement of these hormones is, of course, essential. However, to be effective, Oestrogen/Testosterone in tablet form is inadequate and this necessitates replacement of these hormones in a slow release form by means of an implant inserted under the skin which will relieve effects of hormone depletion for 3-6 months. Should this process not be undertaken, the following effects on a woman's body can, and do, occur:-</PARA>
<PARA>- Gradual development of osteoporosis (bone loss) and consequent risk of fractures. </PARA>
<PARA>- Increased incidence of heart disease and stroke</PARA>
<PARA>- Severe mood swings</PARA>
<PARA>- Depression</PARA>
<PARA>- Sleeplessness</PARA>
<PARA>- Increased urinary frequency and difficulty with bladder control</PARA>
<PARA>- Hot flushes</PARA>
<PARA>- Short term memory loss</PARA>
<PARA>- Frequent headaches</PARA>
<PARA>- Blurred vision</PARA>
<PARA>- And some comparatively minor symptoms. </PARA>
<PARA>The costs involved in each implant are costly, i.e.:-</PARA>
<PARA> Oestrogen: up to $150 per implant (depending on strength required) Testosterone/Progestogen (in the form of Androgen): up to $50 per implant</PARA>
<PARA>None of these costs are recoverable from any Medical or Health Benefits Fund-including, of course, Medicare. The regularity of treatment varies for the individual but generally occurs at 3-6 monthly intervals and can therefore cost any individual woman in excess of $1100 per year (only the Doctor's fee is claimable). As you can see, bearing in mind that this procedure may be necessary for women from the relatively young age of 30, the overall and ongoing essential treatment cost is expensive and has the potential of becoming socially discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA>Upon consultation with the Managing Director of `Organon', the sole company that manufactures and distributes implants in Australia, I am informed that the cost of producing the implants in England, bringing them to Australia and distributing them more than justifies the price the company is charging. However, upon each request to have products free listed with P.B.A., they have been asked to `at least halve costs in most cases', making it totally infeasible and uneconomic to even lodge a request to have HRT implants free-listed, as P.B.A. offer no price exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I also questioned `Organon' as to their approach to the P.B.A.C. Pricing Authority within the Dept. of Health (who advise me they would be interested and flexible). `Organon' feels the Pricing Authority is guided by Consumer Price Indexing prices and, based on experience, cannot guarantee that the manufacturer will receive price increases in relation to CPI and that Dept. of Health are unprepared to negotiate prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line, it appears, is that the manufacturer have previous listed products upon request from P.B.A. and have been given the option of accepting 33% of listed price or removing product from market. </PARA>
<PARA> As an overview, and certainly from a consumer's viewpoint, I cannot help but feel the Government's interest is elsewhere than the health and welfare of the Australian community and seek justification in the availability of HRT implants on the PBA free-list. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I present a petition to reinforce the public's and my firm conviction that HRT implants should be free-listed to halt the social and sexual discrimination, I have no doubt that `Organon's' response will be refusal to apply for free-listing on the grounds of `uneconomic viability of the proposition'. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek your assistance in enabling this product to be free-listed or, alternatively, enable a rebate through `Medicare'; however I feel that as soon as another company takes the initiative to commence either manufacture or import, all implant applications will be unquestionably PBA listed without manufacturers having to endure the uneconomic restrictions placed by authorities in a wonderful country that otherwise leads the world in many other fields of medicine. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Gail Liddell</PARA>
<PARA>In preparation for my contribution to the debate on the legislation before the House, I considered writing my own speech, but I kept coming back time and again to Gail Liddell's own letter to the Minister for health and reached the obvious conclusion that I certainly cannot add to it or improve upon it. I do regard, as does Gail Liddell and so many other women who suffer a problem of hormone replacement therapy, the reading out of this plea to the Minister for health as a necessity. I certainly look forward to either his reply or that of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services to what is an obviously despairing need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a contribution to the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill because the Bill understates and underestimates the role of pharmacists in many areas of Australia, particularly in country areas of Australia. For many of us, it is the first point of contact when we feel a bit off colour. I dare say that every honourable member in this House has, at one time or another, sought assistance from a pharmacist, and generally, in most cases, that advice came free of charge, which is fairly rare in these days of professional activities. I want to be associated with the service that they do provide to the community in a purely voluntary capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation itself restricts entitlement to receive the pharmaceutical benefits scheme benefits to Australian residents or specially approved persons, and this brings it into line with the eligibility for the Medicare card. It also provides for an on-line entitlement checking device-and here we start with the black box-between the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) computer and community pharmacies to enable pharmacists to immediately check the eligibility of patients to free, concessional or general pharmaceutical benefits. It is said that the system is voluntary. However, the pharmacists will not be paid for prescriptions if the HIC records indicate a patient was not eligible for the level of subsidy claimed at the time of dispensing and the pharmacist has not checked the eligibility of the patient. The pharmacist must install and use the checking device or suffer a financial penalty. Further on, the legislation states that there will be some pharmacists exempted from this if they are in isolated locations. I am not exactly sure what `isolated' means, but I presume that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, may be able to describe what `isolated' means. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that I thought would have been given some consideration would have been the pharmacist's ability to pay for the installation of the computer equipment. One would have thought that that would have been a very important criteria to ensure that the pharmacists have the ability to pay for that computer, which I understand would be about $10,000-worth. Many small country pharmacies would be looking very hard at that. In fact, I doubt whether many of them would have the ability to pay for that equipment. I think that what the Government has done is take a huge sledge-hammer to crack a walnut. The Government talks about tightening up the eligibility for pharmaceuticals and the flow of drugs to residents of other countries or overseas visitors and persons not entitled to pharmaceutical benefits. That may be some small advantage, but it puts a very heavy burden and a significant extra workload on all of the pharmacists who carry out those tasks. The pharmacists are put in the awkward position of being forced into the role of policemen. Really, that puts them in a very difficult situation with their customers. The embarrassment perhaps of customers who allege that they are entitled to the level of subsidy that they do seek, I believe, puts pharmacists in an invidious position. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists will effectively be forced to use the checking device or run the risk of not being paid in the event that a patient is not eligible as claimed. The Government really has failed to substantiate the estimated savings from the eligibility testing-and it is talking about something like $12m in 1991-92. That is a bit of a fuzzy figure that it has estimated and, without any clarity, the Government really cannot determine exactly whether that in fact will be the net savings or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the privacy, security and separation of the data. I think that is absolutely vital. I believe that the legislation has the potential to build up a central database, as would have occurred with the Australia Card proposal, and we would want to fight that as vigorously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I do support the amendments which my colleague the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods), put forward. I am pleased that he has submitted those amendments, particularly the amendment opposing clause 14 which makes it compulsory to submit claims via the computerised transmission system. In the short time that I had available to me, I wanted to support the shadow Minister in his efforts on behalf of the pharmacists, particularly throughout country areas of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to report to the House on the matter of privilege raised last Monday by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). The complaint of the honourable member was based on reported statements of Mr Bill Ludwig to the effect that if certain Government members voted for the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in the party leadership ballot, their party endorsement would be called into question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member quoted extracts from House of Representatives Practice and May's Parliamentary Practice on the questions of intimidation of members and improper influence. I am not aware of any exact precedents for the matters complained of.</PARA>
<PARA> Complaints of some relevance were raised in the House in 1983 and 1986. The 1983 case concerned alleged intimidation of Government members in connection with Government decisions relating to uranium mining, and the 1986 issue concerned reported statements of the then honourable member for Adelaide to do with disciplining Government members who had `caused a fuss' in connection with uranium sales.</PARA>
<PARA> In neither case was a motion given precedence, it being noted that Speakers of the House of Commons had expressed views to the effect that arrangements made within political parties were unlikely to give rise to matters of privilege or contempt. It was also noted that no member had claimed to have been intimidated, and reference was made to the policy of restraint in the use of the House's powers in relation to privilege and contempt.</PARA>
<PARA> In all parties, numerous matters arise for determination and members are subject to representations, urgings and pressure as to their positions. I repeat my view that, as a general rule, the House should not attempt to intervene in arrangements made within political parties.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite this, however, if any member sought the protection of the House in such matters, I believe that the House ought to seek the advice of the Committee of Privileges as to the proper course. But I do not believe that a complaint of alleged intimidation or improper influence raised by a third party is a good foundation for action in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, in the present case, as no member has used the procedures of the House to claim that he or she has been subject to intimidation or improper influence, I am not prepared to grant precedence to a motion on the complaint.</PARA>
<PARA>House adjourned at 7.53 p.m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) (a) The following table shows the number of unemployment benefit (UB) recipients by sex and duration current at 15 February 1991 (this being the date of the latest available quarterly survey of unemployment beneficiaries from which the information is obtained) for the Mildura, Swan Hill and Horsham Regional Offices of the Department of Social Security.</PARA>

<PARA>Males:</PARA>

<PARA>1632</PARA>
<PARA>1012</PARA>
<PARA>925</PARA>
<PARA>Females:</PARA>
<PARA>Duration up to 1 year ...</PARA>
<PARA>393</PARA>
<PARA>281</PARA>
<PARA>274</PARA>
<PARA>Duration over 1 year ...</PARA>
<PARA>67</PARA>
<PARA>99</PARA>
<PARA>58</PARA>
<PARA>Total ...</PARA>
<PARA>460</PARA>
<PARA>380</PARA>
<PARA>332</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) The Department of Social Security does not hold information on the circumstances of people who have ceased receiving unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (c) Information relating to the number who have undergone retraining under Government schemes is not available from DSS files. All unemployment benefit recipients are required to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service and may be referred to retraining schemes by that agency.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) According to ABS labour force estimates, in April 1990 the rural unemployment rate was 7.1% compared with 5.9% in metropolitan areas. In April 1991 the unemployment rate was 10.3% in rural areas compared with 9.9% in the metropolitan areas. This shows that the gap between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan unemployment rate has narrowed over the 12 month period between April 1990 and April 1991 (from 1.2 percentage points to 0.4 percentage points).</PARA>
<PARA> A similar trend is shown using UB figures. Between March 1991 and April 1991 the number of unemployed in metropolitan areas increased by 4.2% while the number of unemployed in rural areas increased by 1.2%.</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployed persons in both rural and urban Australia will benefit from the provisions of the NEWSTART strategy. The NEWSTART program will lead to greater participation in employment, education and training by the unemployed and lower dependence on Commonwealth income support.</PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the existing NEWSTART program for long-term unemployment beneficiaries has shown that this type of intervention can produce positive results. Over the two years to February 1991, the number of long-term UB recipients declined while the total UB population increased by 151,000 (36%).</PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the current NEWSTART program for the long-term unemployed, with its significant formal contact between longterm unemployment beneficiaries and officers of DSS and CES and expanded labour market program opportunities, has been taken into account in developing the Newstart strategy which is to begin in July 1991. Results from a survey of the NEWSTART eligible population conducted in March 1990 found that those who received an intensive interview from DSS and CES officers were more likely to find employment and participate in a labour market program than those who did not receive an interview. The majority of those who received an interview reported that it was effective and thought that it improved their chances of gaining employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on labour market programs was lifted substantially in the March 1991 Industry Statement and will continue to be monitored in the light of labour market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security has recently produced a book, `Help for people in country areas', which outlines the range of Commonwealth and State Government assistance which is available to people in country areas.</PARA>
