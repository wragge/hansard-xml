<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister admitted that Mr Keating's run for the leadership was `off-putting to some extent'. I ask: is it not a fact that he has been totally preoccupied with the Keating threat, and that the only thing he has done for the unemployed in the last 18 months is to add to their number?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If those opposite do not understand the English language, that is their trouble. They say that I have been preoccupied. Mr Speaker, as you and any discerning member of this Parliament would observe, I have been engaged within the Cabinet, outside the Cabinet, within this country and overseas on a range of activities calculated to pursue the best interests of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of what I have done for employment in this country, I would contrast my record with that of the Leader of the Opposition any day. It is the case that we have averaged an employment creation rate in this country of 177,000 per year in our period of office, which is almost exactly three times the rate of employment creation under the Opposition parties when they were in government, advised by the now Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can indicate that today the Government has announced some important new initiatives to ensure that value adding and resource development projects will increase in this country. What we have announced is that a new process has been developed whereby we have built upon initiatives announced in the March economic statement. That statement established two mechanisms: the subcommittee of Cabinet to look at sectoral initiatives, and the major projects group of Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have developed is a proactive approach to industry development which is based on sound business opportunities&mdash;investment opportunities that come to the Government but are not proceeding because either the necessary facilitation does not exist or there are impediments that the Government is capable of addressing. It links that industry initiative, the sound investment proposal, into government, and sets a time scale against which the appropriate industry Minister&mdash;depending on the nature of the proposal&mdash;needs to report back to the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet within 45 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government today announced two examples based upon this process: one which will ensure the ability of this country to retain and develop the technology associated with the building of a magnesium metal industry in this country, and the other for the advancement of a mineral sands deposit. There will be more to come. The approach involves an addressing of sensibly identified impediments and, where necessary, facilitation has to be undertaken by the Government either in accessing existing programs or in making the necessary linkages which for the time being are not occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an adjunct to this, during the discussion last night it was also recognised that there was a need for the Government to come forward with a more effective means of streamlining the approval mechanisms for these projects. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and I will be putting forward such a proposal in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this Government is committed to the expansion of productive activity in this country, particularly based on our resource industries, be they agriculture, forestry or mining. It is commitment to the expansion of those activities that lead to net export growth because new job opportunities will flow from that. This initiative announced today is an important element in ensuring that that program will be implemented.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0U4">Mr HARRY WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. Can the Minister inform the House what the Government is doing to improve the delivery of health services to rural and remote communities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2272" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One ought, firstly, to acknowledge that there are quite serious difficulties&mdash;and sometimes increasing difficulties&mdash;in providing services to rural communities, especially remote communities. That is reflected in a number of ways. It is reflected particularly in the absence of professionals, particularly doctors, in the more remote communities. But even in less remote rural communities often the full range of services is not provided. Indeed, where services are provided they are often make-do services rather than being entirely appropriate for the purpose. For example, in many of the hospitals in rural areas quite a high proportion of the patients are there not because they are particularly ill but because their admittance is seen to be an appropriate response to peoples' need for care, although that care might be more effectively provided in a nursing home or hostel, or even more effectively provided in the home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Page asked what the Government was doing about the delivery of health services to rural communities. In 1989 the Government announced a package of over $6m to provide for multipurpose centres in rural areas; that is, the Government thought that through these centres it would be able to make a contribution so that even bush hospitals might better be replaced with facilities that included components of other programs. Through the process involving Commonwealth-State relations and particularly meetings of Health and Aged Care Ministers it was agreed in April of this year that a multipurpose funding task force should be established to look at the issue of providing better services in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That task force, which is soon to release a report, suggests that it would be possible to develop quite different and more flexible funding arrangements to provide better services for rural areas. It particularly puts forward the suggestion of pooling so that the funds the Commonwealth might contribute, whether in the form of Medicare, pharmaceutical funds, nursing homes or hostels, or what the State might spend on hospitals and community nursing, might be pooled. Out of those pooled funds it might be possible to develop more appropriate service models in rural areas. By this approach we would be able to use the funds more effectively and achieve much greater efficiency in a situation in which it is quite often difficult to provide the service efficiently, and we would be able to provide a service that gives much greater user satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Page asked a very serious question, which the Commonwealth has been concerned about. We are piloting more multipurpose centres. I have written to State Ministers indicating our willingness to do that. Through the Premiers Conference process the concept of pooling might enable us to achieve more radical reform that, incidentally, could only be achieved on the basis of Medicare. Medicare provides a universal basis to enable funding transfers and to enable a construction of different models that are more appropriate and would be more appropriate in rural situations. The honourable member's question is an important one that the Government has been pursuing and will pursue in the future.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Treasury's own index of competitiveness, today we are 15 per cent less competitive than we were in 1982-83 when the Hawke Government came to office. The first reason, a failure on economic grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to blame the accord and a supposed veto power exercised by the officials of the ACTU on major reforms. This is frightening stuff. I checked the Treasury's indexes of competitiveness to see how our economic policy has performed on competitiveness. These are the indices of unit labour costs and prices adjusted for exchange rate changes. On a CPI basis they declined by 13.8 per cent between 1982-83 and 1990-91, on a unit labour cost basis by 17.3 per cent and on a GDP deflator basis by 15.6 per cent. Here it is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. If the Leader of the Opposition had examined the notes describing the data he would have found that a rise implies a deterioration and a fall, an improvement in competitiveness. Let me explain the problem for the Professor. In other words, the competitive situation is the opposite of what the Leader of the Opposition has asserted. Competitiveness has improved by 13.8 per cent, 15.6 per cent or 17.3 per cent over the period, depending on the measure used. It has not deteriorated. The conclusion we can draw from that is not failure but success.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, this whole question of the media concentration and the ownership of Fairfax is centred very much on the Tourang bid. Let me make some observations, as I think the honourable gentleman would want me to, on that particular central aspect of the issue of media concentration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, any discussion of increased concentration of media control as a result of the Tourang bid for Fairfax being successful is, of course, at this stage entirely premature. There is nothing before the Government at this stage. As I think the honourable gentleman will know, the receivers are still to make their recommendation to the consortium of banks on which of the bids best meets the interests of the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is the case that, should that bid nominated by the receivers include foreign equity, it would be subject to consideration by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which would then make a recommendation based on an assessment of the national interest to the Treasurer, who would then make the final decision on whether or not to allow that purchase to proceed. So that is the state of play. The Treasurer has already indicated that he would consult with his colleagues before making his decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this would also be of interest to the honourable gentleman: on the question of control, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is currently investigating the circumstances of the Tourang bid to establish whether there is any possibility of an extension of control. If&mdash;and I underline `if'&mdash;the Tourang bid were successful, and if it were to establish control over the operations of the Fairfax group by Mr Packer, he would, in those circumstances, be in breach of the Broadcasting Act and would be obliged to divest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation we are confronted with; those are the elements that are taking place. At this stage, obviously we are in a hypothetical situation. For instance, if the Melbourne bid&mdash;the AIN bid&mdash;were to be successful and recommended by the receiver, there is no question, as I understand it, of foreign ownership being involved. The matter arises, as I say, if there were to be that recommendation. Those are the processes that are to be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Foreign Investment Review Board looks at the test in terms of national interest and makes a recommendation to the Treasurer. He would be consulting with us and we would be making a judgment in terms of what we believe was in the national interest. I would say that, in making a judgment about that, I would not regard as unimportant the petition that was put before us.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2274" SPEAKER="Free The Hon R.V." NAMEID="HG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LINDSAY" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The decision announced earlier today follows endorsement by Cabinet of a joint submission from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Resources and me and an expression of support from the Queensland Government. The decision was taken in the context of exciting prospects for magnesium metal. I quote briefly from the statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Magnesium is the lightest of all structural metals. World demand is expected to increase significantly over the next decade because of the metal's light weight, high strength and recyclability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international demand for magnesium metal will be enhanced by the increasingly stringent emission regulations for motor vehicles in the United States and Japan. These will require the development of lighter motor vehicles with much greater use of light materials such as magnesium metal.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision addressed an impediment in the form of an R&amp;D gap of some $25m. The decision will allow a pilot plant to be constructed at Gladstone, costing $55m, paid for through a private sector contribution of $30m, with $5m from the Queensland Government and $20m from the Commonwealth in the form of a loan through CSIRO repayable through royalties. It will allow work to proceed at Gladstone on the extraction of magnesium metal from ore obtained from the Kunwarara deposit, which I understand is the world's largest high purity deposit of magnesite. It will provide the opportunity for the development of an Australian extraction technology and will further allow the partners to proceed with the construction of a commercial plant in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House some of the very exciting value adding prospects that exist in this industry. If one were simply to dig up the ore and export it, one would receive $60 per tonne. But extraction of the metal yields a product worth $4,000 a tonne. That is before one considers the possibilities which exist in the development of alloys and in the manufacture of automotive parts. The Government, through its decision, is laying the foundations for an exciting new Australian industry based on the commercialisation of Australian research and development. It follows a long history of involvement by CSIRO&mdash;and a long history of involvement and enthusiastic support from the honourable member for Hinkler and his colleague the honourable member for Capricornia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable gentleman had followed all of the processes, he would not have asked the question in the form he has. Back in 1990, we approached the Premiers about getting a closer and more effective working relationship, particularly as we were moving to the edge, as it were, of what we were able to do in our own constitutional bailiwick about micro-economic reform and we were going to have to deal with the States in areas such as road, rail and electricity. As we moved to talk to the States about those issues, they wanted to have on the agenda the issue of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and that was perfectly proper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we set going at the October meeting last year in Brisbane was a series of studies to examine the range of options that could be available for consideration by the Commonwealth and the States at future meetings. A great deal of work has been done by the officials from the Commonwealth Treasury and from the treasuries of the States and the Territories, and we very much appreciate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this issue was discussed in Brisbane there were certain indications given by myself and the then Treasurer as to the parameters of concern, that we were not going to be doing anything which would prejudice the discharge of the responsibility that the Commonwealth properly has in conducting the macro-economic policy of this country. That is on the record.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of certain considerations having been put up in recent weeks about what we might or might not do, I made it clear in my discussions with my Caucus colleagues yesterday that, so far as the granting of income taxing powers to the States is concerned, I would not regard that as being on. Obviously they may want to talk about it, but as far as I am concerned not only is it not on but also, as far as I know, it is not something that recommends itself to the States. I certainly have not received any indication from the States at all that they would want to have State income taxing powers. May I say, parenthetically, that they would be out of their collective cotton-picking minds if they chose to have it, I would have thought. Nevertheless, I have made the situation clear and I do not think there will be any issue raised between us because I do not think they will be asking for those powers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the suggestion that the States might have a share of the Commonwealth imposed taxation revenue, I have made it quite clear&mdash;and indeed it is also made clear in the voluminous report from the officials&mdash;that it has to be understood in regard to the concept of the States taking a given share that it runs counter to what is the theoretical underpinning of their concern about vertical fiscal imbalance. The concept of the concern about vertical fiscal imbalance is, simply put, that there is this gap between the responsibility that the government has, the State government in this case, for the raising of its revenue vis-a-vis the responsibility that it has for spending.

It points out that there could conceptually be some advantages in having one area responsible for the imposition of these fees.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a couple of these reports, largely emanating from the honourable member for Gilmore, in which he manages, in the face of all the evidence, to make the usual Opposition assertion that there has been no progress in that area. What underlies that is dismay that the objectives put in place by this Government some time ago in pursuing waterfront reform have been achieved and the results, in terms of productivity, have been improvements in excess of what we anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might go to some of that detail. Unlike the honourable member for Gilmore, at least there are some people, particularly in the media, who have chosen to analyse these facts and have found their conclusions to be the same as the Government's and not his. The fact is that in major ports around Australia the old industry wide pooled labour system has been replaced by company based employment, and the supporting structures are being dismantled. More than 2,250 older, less skilled employees have accepted early retirement from the industry, in addition to 760 employees who have left the industry by natural attrition. This represents a 30 per cent cut in the work force. There has been extensive award restructuring, consolidating some 20 awards and agreements into a single stevedoring industry award. A multitude of labour categories and pay rates under the old awards have been replaced by a seven-level skills based classification system. Union coverage is undergoing a major rationalisation with the aim of a single union representing waterfront and seagoing employees. Already seven unions covering the stevedoring work force have been reduced to three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are reporting productivity improvements of up to 80 per cent and are aiming for consistent performance levels with overseas ports. For example, Conaust advises of productivity gains of up to 80 per cent at its Sydney CTAL container terminal, and truck turnaround time is commonly just 15 minutes, which is 100 per cent better than the target in its enterprise agreement of 30 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strang Patrick stevedoring also reports an 80 per cent lift in productivity at its Melbourne operation from handling an average of 12 to 13 containers per crane hour to an average of 22, which is better than comparable performances in major European ports. Indeed, Peter Roberts in an article a couple of days ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> pointed out these statistics. The following crane hour figures compare the rate of lifting containers from medium sized cellular container vessels at comparable ports: Port Melbourne, 22; Felixstowe, 19.7; Hamburg, 27.4; Bremerhaven, 21.0; Zeebrugge, 19.5; Le Havre, 19.3. What we clearly see from that is that, on the waterfront, we are now not just up to but exceeding performances in most of those European ports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question concerned Cambodia and the Government's response to the conclusion of the comprehensive agreement in regard to that country. As I was about to say, firstly, I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. It is the case, Mr Speaker, as you well know&mdash;I know of your concern in this issue&mdash;that for more than a decade the tragedy of Cambodia has been one of the world's most disturbing humanitarian issues. In addition to that, it has been one of our region's most urgent strategic problems. It has had that fundamental dual importance for this nation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, this Government, through both the former Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, and the present Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, as I think all honourable members know, has given a very high priority to helping the search for a solution to the Cambodian problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broader context&mdash;if I may put it that way&mdash;for the achievement of a settlement of the Cambodian problem has, of course, arisen through the great changes in the relations between the superpowers. That has provided the context. Those changes have required the various backers of the Cambodian factions to reassess their interests in the situation in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that context, which has existed for some years, the key obstacle to a settlement had been the inability of the factions involved directly and of their backers to agree on who would run the country while the elections took place. That had been a core problem in trying to resolve the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that late in 1989 Senator Evans took up a broad idea which had been put forward in the first instance by Congressman Stephen Solarz of the United States. He put forward the broad concept that the United Nations should, in effect, rule Cambodia during a transition period to allow elections to be held in which Cambodians could make their own democratic choice about the government which would be in charge of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, took that simple idea and turned it into a comprehensive, detailed and practical plan which envisaged a bigger role for the United Nations than any it has ever taken before in any comparable or vaguely comparable situation. To put it mildly, the Evans transformation of the Solarz idea was to create an exceptionally bold plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having taken the Solarz broad concept and translated it into this detailed, comprehensive and bold plan, Senator Evans then went about the job of selling the plan. He did that to the Cambodian factions and their backers&mdash;obviously that had to be done; he did it to our regional neighbours; and, ultimately most importantly, he sold it to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Since then&mdash;as you know, Mr Speaker, and as I think the honourable member for Reid appreciates&mdash;Senator Evans, with his Department, has been absolutely tireless in promoting a settlement based on his plan. He has done that through various vicissitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, he has cooperated closely with his friend and colleague the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Alatas, and that has been important not only intrinsically in regard to the settlement of that issue but, as I think the honourable member for Reid will appreciate, also in creating a sensible and productive relationship between us which will be relevant to the bilateral relationship between our two countries. I acknowledge the significance of the cooperation that Senator Evans has received from Mr Alatas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Paris, the week before last&mdash;as we all know and I hope we all appreciate and applaud&mdash;these efforts of Senator Evans with others were rewarded by the signature of an agreement for a comprehensive settlement which was based directly on Senator Evans's plan. The acknowledgment of Australia's role through our Foreign Minister could not have been more directly made than it was in the circumstances in two particular sources. Without intending any disrespect, because I intend none, to our French colleagues, I think it is the case that the French are not generally known for the way in which they throw bouquets around the world in regard to other people. But on this occasion the French Foreign Minister, Mr Dumas, was particularly generous in his observations. I quote what the French Foreign Minister had to say about Australia:</PARA>

Here we have an unqualified and richly deserved compliment. On behalf of the Government and also, I would hope, on behalf of the Parliament as a whole, I congratulate Senator Evans on a remarkable achievement. We are enormously proud of what he has done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go finally to the question of Australia's further role. We have only just begun that role. A team of some 40 ADF communicators is now on standby to go to Cambodia as part of the United Nations advance mission which will provide communications and good offices between the factions until the full United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, is established next year. Its mission, as we should all acknowledge in this place, will be difficult but it will be rewarding and we wish its members well. Australia has offered to provide some 500 personnel for UNTAC itself, including the commander of the main peacekeeping force, as well as electoral assistance. We are committed to helping with reconstruction and repatriation efforts. I conclude by saying that I will be advising the Parliament further about our participation in the United Nations operation in Cambodia when more details are available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The real issue is that most Australians are not interested in any academic or statistical comparison of past recessions. What they want to know is what the future holds. The only issue of real importance now is the quality and timing of recovery. The economic fundamentals will govern the quality of recovery and we are far better placed than we were in 1982-83. Australia is now well positioned for a sustained recovery in investment and employment activities. We have embarked on an era where Australia will be a highly competitive, low inflation country and we have an opportunity to deliver sustained growth in employment and community living standards. That is due only to the policies pursued by this Government in its eight years in office. The program of industry reform initiated by this Government, including tariff reform and financial deregulation, is fundamental to Australia's economic prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let us remember that the Hawke Government has delivered the lowest inflation rate for 20 years. The accord between this Government and the ACTU has resulted in gross profit share reaching record levels. Even in the midst of recession the profit share remains close to the historical highs recorded under this Government and is well above the levels recorded in any year under the previous Government. The capital stock has been expanded, reflecting the strong growth in business investment prior to the recession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was contrasting the approach of the Opposition, which once again in this area of policy relies essentially on privatisation, without detail, on the reduction of the public sector, on selling off housing stock and on substituting rent assistance for a public housing program as representing some kind of policy. Against that, through the national housing strategy the Government is seeking to develop a comprehensive policy that goes not only to the question of public housing and rental assistance but also to dealing with those constraints that exist within the Australian community and exist for middle income Australians, especially new home owners, when it comes to finding affordable housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we get stupid interjections from the Opposition is that housing is a complex issue. What we have never had from the Opposition is a complex and comprehensive policy on housing that goes not to one strand or to one degree of simplicity but to housing in all of its complexity and not only to its financial aspects but also to the housing industry and its structure, to the availability of land and to reports such as that of the Indicative Planning Council which suggests that, as the housing recovery that it predicts occurs this year and next year, there will be considerable constraints at the level of land, which is essentially the responsibility of the States, not the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So through the process of the development of the housing strategy, through the consultation occurring between the Commonwealth and the States, we will be able to deal not with simplicities but with all the complexities that are important in developing an efficient and equitable supply of housing. That does not mean selling off the public housing stock; it means linking public housing policies, for example, to improved rental assistance so that rent has its role. That issue cannot be addressed if there is not an addressing of the issue of the supply of housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notably, in Australia housing markets have failed to address the need for rental accommodation or to deal with the problems that people have with the transfer cost of moving from units and smaller units of housing into family housing. So there is a range of issues and they are being addressed through the national housing strategy. They certainly go a long way further than simply public housing; they go to the whole balance of housing policies and they fit into the Government's concern about cities.</PARA>

Would you explain to the House the nature of that exclusiveness? Is there any consideration payable by the ABC? Is there any denial of access to other broadcasting channels or media?

Provided that they are willing to run it, they can run it. Any televising organisation or radio organisation can take excerpts of the proceedings. Provided there is an element of balance in that, they can be used in other re-broadcasts at a later date. There is, to my knowledge, no exclusive right that the ABC has, though I must say, in support of the ABC, that it is the only media organisation that has taken Question Time in both Houses and run it live.

That definition has been rejected by the Government and by the Opposition and in all my writings and speeches on this matter. Secondly, Mr Lane attacks me as Chairman of the Parliamentarians for Croatia and Slovenia and, indeed, he attacks the right of parliamentarians to have such a group. Mr Lane then accuses me of inconsistency, claiming that I support multiculturalism in Australia but only monoculturalism in Croatia. He attributes to me this view:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to the challenge before me in raising this matter of public importance because it does relate to the future of this country and to the crisis in the economy. It might well be Rasheek in the Melbourne Cup, but it is chaos in the Caucus. No matter who wins the Cup, there is a massive crisis in the country. I must say that never in the history of the Federation of Australia has so much damage been done to so many Australians by so few&mdash;namely, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the current Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), and this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last shred of leadership of this Prime Minister evaporated yesterday when he could not even withstand the further shot from ex-Treasurer Keating. He folded up his tent, collapsed the new federalism program and in fact tore up large chunks of new federalism under the pressure of the Caucus. He vacated his responsibilities as Prime Minister of Australia, as leader of the Australian Labor Party, in this worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say by way of background that the Prime Minister launched this huge initiative right back on 19 July 1990 in a famous National Press Club speech when he made it a major commitment of this term of his Government. He made it a priority to embrace not only the Federal Government but all State governments and, by degrees, local government. He laid down the challenge for Australia to genuinely bring forward micro-economic reform, to genuinely bring forward new federalism in respect of financial arrangements between the States and the Federal Government, in respect of taxation arrangements between the States and the Federal Government and, indeed, in respect of a range of other matters. In fact I helped the Prime Minister write one paragraph of this important speech which he took from a House of Representatives Committee report. By way of an example, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth may be subject to three non-integrated rail systems, four changes of locomotives, five different safe working systems, six different sizes of loading gauge, 10 different engineering standards of basic standard gauge rail track, and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes, refuelling and inspections.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how wide the speech was on new federalism. This was the great launch in July 1990, some 16 months ago&mdash;but what now?  What happened yesterday? Yesterday, following on from the speech at the National Press Club by ex-Treasurer Keating, the honourable member for Blaxland, the Prime Minister folded up. He collapsed large chunks of the new federalism program at the behest of one backbencher&mdash;the honourable member for Blaxland, who has no shame; who created an unemployment figure of one million.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition correctly points out, he delivered us a designer recession. It was a recession we had to have. The Government might not accept our quotes on that, so let us turn to what Professor Helen Hughes of the Australian National University said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead we have inflicted a totally unnecessary and unwarranted recession on ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was gripped by trade problems whose principal cause was the inaptness of macroeconomic policies while Paul Keating's policies as Treasurer undermined the economy and led to the present recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We crippled our exporters by high inflation, high interest rates and greatly overvalued exchange rates. The principal cause of all three were hopeless fiscal policies, hopeless monetary and financial policies and hopeless income policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Hughes went on&mdash;I invite honourable members to listen to this very carefully&mdash;to be very critical of the tax system in Australia, labelling it as a `byzantine, inefficient and archaic tax system that invites avoidance and evasion'. Amen! I will say more on that in a moment. She said that Australia needed to reform its tax laws if it is to be internationally competitive. It was a recession from ex-Treasurer Keating we supposedly had to have; but, frankly, it was a recession we did not have to have. He gave it to us as a consequence of his interest rate policies. Ex-Treasurer Keating has no shame; he is a disgrace. He should depart this Parliament&mdash;the sooner the better&mdash;and then we might well have a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other sad footnote to that National Press Club speech of ex-Treasurer Keating's was that he chose to move from the normal Wednesday to a Tuesday. The ex-Treasurer gave that speech to the National Press Club on Tuesday, 22 October. What happened on Wednesday?  He could not dare speak on the Wednesday because there was a national strike in New South Wales. It gets worse. Guess what the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) had the hide to do on the day of that national strike?  He closed his electorate office and put up a notice saying, `This electorate office is closed'. Constituents were denied access to this electorate office because of the industrial dispute in New South Wales on that day. The man does not deserve to be a Federal member. This is a Federal electorate office, and we should let him answer for his action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance focuses on the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was described by one of his own as Old Jellyback. If ever there were an example of the Old Jellyback tendencies, it is in relation to Federal-State relations. Prime Minister Hawke, as he always does, folds under pressure, like a deckchair on the sinking Titanic. In the specific area of Federal-State financial relations I remind honourable members of the joint statement arising for the November Premiers Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crucial and inter-related issues of reform, of Commonwealth/State financial arrangements, including reviewing the distribution of taxation powers to reduce vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the matter listed right up until yesterday. Today, in the force of Question Time and the questions raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), this is a matter which has now been taken off the agenda and which the Prime Minister has walked away from addressing when we need to have change and when we need to have radical reform in this country if we are give jobs back to the jobless and if we are to provide a turnaround and make our economy truly internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preliminary conclusions from the Special Premiers Conference in July, very interestingly, included the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very large reduction in the existing degree of vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the States could be made before the existing arrangements for horizontal fiscal equalisation would be called into question.</PARA>
<PARA>But that is when Keating intervened. Keating came forward and decided to torpedo the Perth Premiers Conference and all it entailed&mdash;all that was designed to be discussed and positively considered. He did so to the point that it was taken out at the Caucus yesterday. But Keating was not on his own, and this is where we come to the leadership of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister no longer has the courage to call into line people such as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) who said today, `It is perfectly okay', and, by implication, `I want to encourage the attacks of the honourable member for Blaxland on the Prime Minister'. How can the Prime Minister sit in that Cabinet, with the convention of the Westminster system on Cabinet solidarity, and have Dawkins encouraging Keating to launch attack upon attack upon him? I realise that this might upset the Deputy Prime Minister, so I will refer to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out that the Minister for Social Security encouraged the honourable member for Blaxland in this path. He added to the burden of the situation when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to be very careful in handing over Commonwealth powers, especially in the area of welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Deputy Prime Minister wants to get so excited about this matter, there is also a quote by him. I know honourable members may want to get excited about other matters, but I want to quote what the Deputy Prime Minister said. The Deputy Prime Minister should listen to this, because this is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is entirely right that the Commonwealth should retain the whip hand in these (taxation) matters, because we do have to manage macro-economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened? Jellyback folded, Caucus is in chaos and, while the Cabinet and the Caucus fiddle, the country burns&mdash;there are a million people unemployed and the economy, sadly, is not in recovery. Much as I would dearly want to stand up in this House and say that there is a dramatic economic upswing, increased confidence and new jobs, the reality of the situation is totally the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is reflected in a case that has recently come to my attention. A couple bought a dairy farm in 1980 after 10 years of living in Melbourne. They worked hard to build up the property and within four years they had drawn up plans to extend the house to fit their four children. But then came the price slump and the drought and the wife took up employment at the local hospital. The final blow, however, was the news that the wife's job at the hospital would cease in December. Now they cannot afford trips into town and they fear family illness. That situation and that individual suffering, multiplied right across the country, is manifest everywhere. It has led to the circumstance where the husband is unable to sleep at night, although he is always tired, there is brittleness in the way family members relate and increased asthma attacks are a daily event. In other words, there is a huge amount of economic misery out there. There is confusion over the direction and leadership of this Government, and the leadership of this Prime Minister as he prepares to go to Perth for the next Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say further that there is an absolute need to clarify the Federal, State and local government of this country. There is a strong case for establishing a national electricity grid, and there should be consideration of a Bass link, which would involve a 300 megawatt undersea cable between Gippsland and Tasmania at a cost of some $400m. Equally, what we have successfully exposed today is the fact that the Prime Minister has walked away from his responsibilities as Prime Minister of this country and has failed the test of providing leadership for this country at a time when we need to maximise employment, proper development, economic performance and international competitiveness so that we can together build a better Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a speech, supposedly about Commonwealth-State relations, which essentially delivered an attack on Government back bench members. It was delivered by someone who really has the stature of a backbencher as far as the Opposition is concerned. The fact of the matter is that Federal-State relations is too serious an issue to be dealt with in such a trivial way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just listened to 15 minutes of absolute emptiness. No attempt has been made by the Opposition to go to any point of substance whatsoever on Commonwealth-State relations. There was not one point of substance in 15 minutes. The reason why we will continue to be the Government in this country for a very long time is that we are about substance and getting reforms into this country that will enable the country to operate more effectively, more efficiently and more fairly. That is essentially what governments need to be about. To do that, they need political courage. This Government has won respect because, again and again, it has demonstrated its capacity to take on very hard issues and to pursue those issues to the point where it achieves very significant reform. We can also say that in the area of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not need to have much of a sense of history on taxation policy to be able to make very clear comparisons. When Opposition members were in government, tax avoidance was the order of the day, the tax system was simply not reformed in any sensible or fundamental way and, effectively, paying one's taxes became an optional extra in this country. Against that, this Government has been prepared to pursue widespread discussion in the community leading up to a tax summit, to canvass a number of options, to make a choice with respect to those options and then to carry through a very significant process of reform. That is the difference. The difference is that this Government has had the courage to carry through reform, whereas the Opposition, when in government, caved in to every interest group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is prepared to address taxation reform in so far as it is of interest to the States. That is why there has been a process to allow discussion to occur between Commonwealth and State officials about a range of taxation options. Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that there was not a great deal of enthusiasm about the transfer of income tax powers to the States, either in Caucus or in the States. I would not have thought that was terribly significant news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the former leader of the conservatives, Malcolm Fraser, was very enthusiastic about encouraging the States to pick up income tax. He legislated to make that possible. For a number of years the States had before them the choice of introducing income taxes. They chose not to do that, just as a number of States are already indicating that, frankly, they are not interested in getting income tax powers. That is a route they are not prepared to go on. Yesterday, the Prime Minister indicated that there was no enthusiasm&mdash;in Canberra and a number of the State capitals&mdash;for an option that involved the transfer of income tax powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, the process is continuing. An options paper has been circulated. Frankly, those options papers have been studied in the way that they have sought to canvass all of the options. No options have been excluded. They have put all of the options on the table and they have investigated the strengths and the weaknesses of those various options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, I have to say that he has had the opportunity to see that work that has been done. Of course, under questioning in the Caucus, he has been prepared to make available what the drift of his thinking is. As I have said, there is nothing particularly newsworthy about that. However, the report will receive further consideration. That final report will be considered after the Government has completed its consideration by the Premiers Conference in November. As I have said, it indicates the full range of options that are available. Those options and their implications can be considered, if you like, in terms of vertical fiscal imbalance as well as horizontal fiscal imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take five minutes of this speech to talk about what has been achieved through the Premiers Conference process. It would be quite wrong to think that not much has been achieved and that not a great deal of energy has arisen out of this Premiers Conference process, particularly related to, for example, the whole area of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the striking things about the Opposition in this Parliament is its willingness to pick on a slogan or perhaps a phrase and to keep repeating it&mdash;day in, day out. I think that members of the Opposition have got used to that kind of sloganeering. It is something that they did when they were in opposition before. They keep repeating and yapping away about micro-economic reform and putting a negative in front of it. They keep saying, `That is not something that the Government has not done anything about'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us forget about the whole question of mutual recognition of standards, what is involved in that and what, effectively, that means in terms of efficiency to have uniform national standards. Let us forget about the agreement on mutual recognition of regulations which would apply where national uniformity is not essential. Let us forget about the mobility in terms of occupations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party wants to interject. I go to the question of electricity. There has never been a period of greater expansion of electricity generation in this country than the period of the late 1970s, when Malcolm Fraser was in power. We went for a massive expansion of electricity supply. In fact, we got ourselves into a situation of massive debt&mdash;which, for a number of States, is a very large part of State debt&mdash;on the assumption that somehow there would be an explosion of interest, in particular in aluminium and power intensive industries. The result of that has been a disaster. It has been a disaster in terms of debt and it has not led to great efficiencies in terms of Australian industry&mdash;quite the opposite. It has, in fact, resulted in industry often being loaded with higher taxes than it would otherwise have to pay. So the creation of a national electricity grid is no easy or simple reform; it is a massive reform. It involves seeking to deal with the problem of oversupply of electricity which in fact flowed from the period when those opposite were in government, when Malcolm Fraser broke the rules and threw out the rule book in terms of the Loan Council and Premiers Conferences and allowed State borrowings to get to a ridiculous point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about government trading enterprise reform and related matters. Improving government enterprises is also an important part of the micro-economic agenda. We heard the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) today talking about the significance of waterfront reform around Australia and its importance to micro-economic reform in Australia. The micro-economic reform agenda effectively cannot be carried through without Federal-State cooperation. The Prime Minister has already achieved a great deal with the Premiers. He has an unfinished agenda and will go a long way further in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the third area of the unfinished agenda which goes to another aspect of Federal-State relations, that is, the whole question of tied grants and the reviews that have been carried out, the so-called functional reviews of a whole range of areas of social policy. That is very important in terms of economic efficiency and it is important in terms of the Federal-State relations agenda because, when we fund the States, as we do, by very large amounts of money&mdash;in the case of health it is billions of dollars for hospitals&mdash;and then see the States making decisions that are not about health but about shifting the costs from the States to the Commonwealth, we realise that that is an issue of micro-economic reform that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we put $1 billion every year under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement, we have the right to look at where that fits in in relation to other objectives that the Government might have and how we can ensure that those objectives are maximised in terms of a comprehensive State housing policy. When we think about people, as we were earlier today in a response to a question from the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) about what occurs in rural areas, we see that the blocks that exist between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of different functional responsibilities mean that we get not only a duplication but also a failure to deliver in rural areas the kinds of services that people have a right to expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need greater flexibility, but we will not get it without sitting down with the States and working through different ways to approach the problem. From the point of view of the Commonwealth, we are flexible in relation to tied grants. We understand that the States are looking for greater flexibility, and that of course can help us address questions of vertical fiscal imbalance just as much as revenue and taxation issues can do. But in doing that we have got to be absolutely sure we are focusing on the kinds of outcomes that the Australian people would expect from government. How stupid it would be to transfer responsibilities from one level of government to another, only to find that the quality of services deteriorates and people's expectations simply cannot be met in a certain area. These areas are sophisticated and demand sophisticated treatment. That is why we have had meetings of the various Ministers with functional responsibility. Whether it is in housing, health, education, child-care or whatever, we have been able to sit down with the Ministers to try to work out an approach that will lead to greater efficiency, will improve equity and, above all, will get for us quality outcomes that Australian people have a right to expect from their government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very exciting exercise with three levels of government sitting together, working through their respective approaches, looking at where cooperation can be enhanced and, above all, looking to the national interests. That is what we are entitled to do. That is why it is a serious business, and why this Parliament did not deserve the kind of trivial rubbish that was dealt out by a backbencher trumped up as a leader of the National Party. There is no reason why our intelligence should be insulted when a serious issue such as Federal-State relations is before the Parliament. Just imagine how much reform would be delivered by those opposite in the area of Federal-State relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of great regret that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who started  making at least a valiant attempt to defend his Government's policy on new federalism, should so soon depreciate his address into one of vituperation towards my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). The sad facts are quite clearly on the record. In every respect, the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) discovered new federalism as if he had received a message from God on the road to Damascus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the Government's involvement in new federalism is on the record. It has been a matter for great criticism by none other than the Premier of South Australia, the then President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bannon. It goes back of course to the inheritance of the previous government when Mr Fraser, then the Prime Minister, summed up his Government's attitude on the appropriate relationship between the States as reflecting `cooperation, not conflict; partnership and not domination'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing is that between 1983, when the Government came to power, and 1990 we heard very little indeed from the Prime Minister or other Ministers about this critical issue which the Opposition has chosen to put before the House today as a matter of fundamental public importance. We are complaining on behalf of the Australian people because of the Government's failure to provide leadership and direction to the nation in this critical area of Federal-State financial relations. We have also made the clear  point that its impact on employment and development during the worst recession since the Great Depression is clearly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of our case is this: over nine years in power, the Prime Minister and his Government saw the light in 1990. Here we are now in 1991, heading towards the third Premiers Conference to consider a host of vital issues which are going to affect future generations of Australians and certainly have a major role to play in the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector reform across this nation. The point needs to be made that in May 1988 at the Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth, on its own initiative, announced it would devolve certain programs to the States from 1 July 1988. The list is hardly profound, nevertheless it should be on the record. It reads as follows: family support; emergency relief; vaccination program; miscellaneous pharmaceutical benefits; royal far west children's health scheme; and royal Queensland bush children's scheme. Most of those programs affect the lives of individual Australians, particularly our children.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of those programs, forced on the States, resulted in very serious financial difficulties for low income families who should have been the beneficiaries of those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is this: as early as 1986, Premier Bannon of South Australia, in a major address, the Sir Robert Garran Memorial Oration, in the same year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to this year's Premiers' conference&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, June 1986&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I raised with the Prime Minister the issue of the administration of Commonwealth and State programmes. My Government recognised that the difficult economic situation facing the whole of the nation would inevitably mean that all Governments would have to accept a degree of restraint in their expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it was my view that, as far as possible, we had to ensure restraint was not translated into cuts in direct services&mdash;we needed innovation&mdash;and a better way of doing things.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, as I said, at the Premiers Conference in 1988, two years later, the attitude adopted by the Commonwealth in the area of programs achieved precisely what Premier Bannon hoped it would not. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister responded positively to this suggestion and made reference to it during his Address to the Nation immediately prior to the Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Conference itself I formally put the proposal and it was agreed that the Commonwealth should urgently take up with the States the rationalisation of administration in areas of shared responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>do not forget this is in 1986&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the issue has been the subject of discussions at `officer level'. This is an interesting euphemism which means that the subject is considered important, but not urgent&mdash;significant but of no real priority.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is, Mr Deputy Speaker: damned from the mouth of the Federal President and probably the most successful Labor State Premier in Australia. He said `significant but of no real priority'. It is a sad fact that the evidence for his statement has been absolutely proven in what has taken place since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech to the National Press Club on 19 July 1990&mdash;remember, four years later&mdash;the Prime Minister finally discovered his conversion on the road to Damascus. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has come to form a closer partnership between our three levels of government&mdash;commonwealth, State and local.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our first task is to move by sensible, practicable steps to get better co-operation within the framework of the Federal Constitution as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, that is a profound and correct statement, but the Opposition wants to know why, over nine years of government, it has taken so long for this Government to go such a short distance down the important road of restructuring Federal-State financial relations in this country. As I said, and as is borne out again in the general progress report released by the Premiers Conference, circulated by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) to all members of this House only yesterday, the important thing is that, again, in this report are those inevitable words mentioned by Mr Bannon:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report by officials will not make recommendations but will outline issues as a basis for discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the entire agenda for the forthcoming Premiers Conference we find the words `basis for discussion'. How many more months, how many more years, how many more decades do the Australian people have to wait before they will see reform that really adds up to something of real value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the last few weeks have been the most damaging of all to this whole exercise. Only a few days ago, on Tuesday, 15 October, 25 Caucus members met and criticised the `secretive' way in which the Federal Government is preparing for next month's Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During recent months a host of Ministers have been going in exactly the opposite directions to those outlined&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;by the Prime Minister in his earlier statement. The former Treasurer, for example, in his Press Club speech last week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federalism is a very broad label, there is sense in a rationalisation of functions but there is no sense&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no sense in giving revenue powers back to the States, none.</PARA>
<PARA>Says who? Former Treasurer Keating. We then heard from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the man who stood here only a few minutes ago trying to bury us in his pseudo eloquence. He basically agreed with Mr Keating. This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think its entirely right that the Commonwealth should retain the whip hand in these (taxation) matters because we do have to manage macroeconomic policy.</PARA>
<PARA>We know how well the Government has done that. The Labor Caucus Community Services and Welfare Committee unanimously endorsed a motion which expressed its `deep concern about the direction in which the Government is heading on possible devolution of community services and welfare functions to the States'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And who was it supported by? The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson); the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown); the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples); and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and the Territories (Mrs Kelly) supported it. All those Ministers, in their own portfolios, have spoken publicly on the record in a way opposing the view being put forward by the Prime Minister. The Opposition and the Australian people once again look at this as an area of major national reform whose time has come but which, under this Administration, will turn to naught. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was disappointed, to say the least, in the contribution of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). I believe that he has brought forward what is, in effect, a serious matter of public importance, but he did not treat it seriously. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he did not have his mind on the business of the House at the time he made his speech. By contrast, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made a more composed and substantial contribution to the debate, although I do not necessarily agree with what he was saying. I think for members of the Opposition to use the Commonwealth-State relations profile and policy as a way of beating about the head the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Cabinet of this Government is not a helpful position for them to take when representing the Australian nation because, in effect, there are many processes and reforms occurring as a result of this form of consultation with the States and the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, many great centralists in this place; some of us would not be here if that were not the case. I am sure that many on both sides of the House would be members of State parliaments in their State of origin if they were not more interested in the national Parliament, national uniformity and in some way of administering the Commonwealth of Australia other than simply through the State government process. The Federal system is a system with which we live and it is the aim of our Government&mdash;and I hope all governments&mdash;to administer it appropriately and efficiently. Therefore, it is useful, important and timely to have a process which allows us to have meaningful discussion with our State colleagues and counterparts on the administration and the responsibilities we share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reluctance to hand powers to the States. Not all States handle these powers well and not all of them even want these powers. This is something we noticed in the last few months when things such as income tax powers were put on the table at the Special Premiers Conference when discussing Commonwealth-State relations in the context of vertical fiscal imbalance. It has not been rushed by the States as a way of achieving their funding needs. Who can blame them? They have to take the responsibility of imposing an income tax. They take very little responsibility for taking funds from the Federal Government when it has raised income tax. This is something that is recognised in this place at least, if not elsewhere in Australia. It does not mean that the division of powers that we are seeking and discussing at present ought not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current review was commenced in July 1990 at the instigation of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It was undertaken in the interests of efficient and appropriate service provisions for the people we all represent in this place. As stated by the Prime Minister at that time, it is designed to improve the financial relationship between the governments; to clarify the roles and responsibilities between the levels of government for the benefit of clients and, indeed, the people of Australia; to implement social justice principles through better delivery and quality of services provided by government at all levels; to enhance the structure of the economy, building on significant micro-economic reform that the Commonwealth has already undertaken; and to cooperate on matters of environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant amount of money to be saved through micro-economic reform. I am sure the Opposition also acknowledges that, but such micro-economic reform cannot be carried to its full extent without State cooperation. Again, it is appropriate to have such discussions with the States. How do we talk to the States about such matters of mutual interest across this chamber and across the nation if we do not talk about sharing other responsibilities as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to develop a national market in Australia. That is understood. We need to develop national uniform standards, which would improve efficiency. In order to do that and to avoid some of the problems that have existed in the past, we need to have a mutual recognition of standards that is an important part of the Special Premiers Conference agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to emphasise in this context that the Federal Government has never agreed in Commonwealth-State discussions to do anything that would prejudice the Commonwealth's ability to manage the nation's affairs and to conduct appropriate macro-economic policy. The process upon which we have embarked is about reviewing all options to achieve outcomes which will benefit the people and the national interest. Consultation has been a continuing process and it occurred only after the Commonwealth Government had already commenced a number of significant reviews, for instance in the area of health and housing, because those areas of community services are the areas that come under the closest scrutiny when the Commonwealth and the States have discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members on the other side have talked about what happened yesterday. What did happen yesterday? The Caucus of the Australian Labor Party in this place had a seminar on the processes and the product of Commonwealth-State relations discussions to date. As the Prime Minister said, our real emphasis and our real concern should be the rights and needs of our citizens. I certainly agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community groups have expressed a very real concern about service delivery if the States take over some programs. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), has actually made that a point in the debate. We cannot disconnect ourselves from the electorate on these matters. Many people have concerns about the States taking over the provision of certain services. Therefore, it is imperative that consultation with the community occur at the same time as the Commonwealth has consultation with the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative also that incentives for cost shifting which exist in the current system be removed. All members of this place are aware that this goes on. It is one element of the Commonwealth-State relations discussion which, hopefully, will be overcome, because by more appropriately allocating responsibility, the service provision or administration, we should be able to ensure that that cost shifting, or the incentive to do it, is reduced as much as it can be. That would be a major achievement which would occur from the changes in administration and the responsibility proposed during the review of Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of micro-economic reform, which I touched on briefly before, we have well in train&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;national rail freight, a national electricity grid, national charging and regulation of heavy vehicles, and national qualifications recognition and standards. These have not come about in isolation; they have come about as part of the mechanism of consultation presented by Commonwealth-State relations and the Special Premiers Conferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it must not be overlooked that the Commonwealth is entitled to its own opinion on the proposals being put on the agenda. That is, in part, what was happening yesterday. It is one thing for the States to propose agenda items and for the Commonwealth to agree to look at them and discuss them, but it is quite another for the Commonwealth to agree blindly to these proposals; hence the concern in the Caucus and elsewhere in the community about the prospect of States taking over an income tax role if they wanted it&mdash;which they do not. Also, the Commonwealth does not favour percentages of general revenue being given to the States on a continuing basis. I think those are very clear positions of the Commonwealth, and positions which the Commonwealth is entitled to state. There is no point in the Commonwealth rolling over and letting the States jump on top of it, so we may as well have our opinions in the arena, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the excise question is up in the air, and I am certain that it will be looked at very carefully to see whether there is any way that further revenue can be made available to the States through that avenue. I am not aware of how that will turn out, but I think that it is still a fairly substantial area of revenue for the States if it is an option that the Commonwealth and the States agree to pursue. The Prime Minister has stated that any agreement on future roles and responsibilities must protect the interest of clients&mdash;that is, Commonwealth and State clients&mdash;and must clearly specify national interests and set out agreed national objectives. I agree with this process and thank the House for its time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has already been indicated by Senator Parer in another place, the coalition parties support the thrust of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. This Bill takes up a number of recommendations that were given to the Government by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report No. 3, following an inquiry which came about as a result of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referenda. This report was given to the Government in May 1989 and we are now, some 2 1/2 years later, debating the Bill that has come from that report. It is interesting to note the time that it has taken for the Government to take up the issues that were put to it in that report. It is a snail's pace operation&mdash;certainly nothing like Let's Elope, which has just shown us how to move with more speed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of major provisions in this Bill which I would like to allude to and discuss briefly. First, the Bill will enable the streamlined processing of electoral enrolment forms in cases where enrolment is claimed for a subdivision in which the claimant is already enrolled. Obviously, it takes up one of the recommendations. The next concerns the provision that the address of a candidate who has a silent enrolment need not be publicly announced at the close of nominations. While I certainly respect the reasons for this being put forward, nonetheless it is a sad reflection on our society that a committee has had to bring forward that recommendation and the Government has had to legislate for it. This may be a reflection of what eight years of Labor government at a Federal level, and in most States, has done for the confidence that some individuals in this community have, feeling the need to maintain a certain amount of secrecy about where they live when in the past all those who wished to stand would have no difficulty in declaring not only who they were but also where they lived. In most cases people would have been quite proud of being able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point, which again is quite straightforward, is that the Bill gives senators and members a choice of recording either their enrolled address or their place of residence when completing a nomination form. Again, I think this probably puts into law what has been the practice on a few occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area of the Bill enables the registered officer or a deputy registered officer of a registered party to lodge the nominations of all the party's endorsed House of Representatives candidates in a State or Territory with the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or the Territory up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. Again, this recognises the opportunity now available through modern communications for a more centralised method. I dare say that it might also recognise candidates who have failed to nominate. On one or two rare occasions candidates for particular parties&mdash;in fact, in one case even a sitting member&mdash;have forgotten to nominate and have lost seats purely because of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly has not happened in Wannon&mdash;and it is not likely to. The next provision in the Bill is to recognise modern technology. It provides that a nomination may, in fact, be made by a facsimile. Of course, that presumes that the candidate's deposit is received prior to nominations. I note that we are not going the whole way with electronic funds transfer and modern technology in the Electoral Office. If we are patient something may happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next area clears up some past misunderstanding. It requires that candidates, when completing a nomination form, specify how they became Australian citizens. Again, this is to avoid the embarrassment of someone not only nominating but also being elected only to find that he is not eligible to take up his seat in this place because he is not an Australian citizen. There is nothing particularly controversial about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision to ensure that any person who makes a claim in a nomination form which is false or misleading in the material respect shall be guilty of an offence for which the penalty will be a fine of $3,000 or imprisonment of six months or both. Again, this recognises the severity of a person making such claims. As all honourable members would agree, this is a reasonable provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now reflect on the same problem I alluded to earlier about the state of our society. There is also a provision to ensure that the addresses of silent electors not be disclosed to persons inspecting postal vote applications. As I said before, the fact that we have to increase secrecy provisions is a sad reflection on our society. Obviously, in a truly democratic society, such provisions would not be necessary. The fact that this Bill has introduced it, the fact that the Committee has felt it necessary to recommend this, is indeed sad. It is a sad reflection on the Government that it has even allowed the need for this sort of thing to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that has caused some discussion is the provision to enable a licensed premises to be used as a polling booth subject to the Electoral Commissioner declaring in writing that he is satisfied that, during the hours of polling at the election or a referendum, no alcohol will be sold or consumed on that part of the premises to be used for polling; part of the premises to be used for polling will be segregated from areas where alcohol is being sold or consumed; and voters will have access to the part of the premises to be used for polling which does not involve passage through an area where alcohol is being sold or consumed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this takes into account the difficulties of finding a suitable polling booth in some areas. It recognises the need to separate that part of the licensed premises, but one wonders as to how some voters, having cast their votes, will find their way out of that building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provision restricts people living within 20 kilometres of a specified place at which a mobile polling is being conducted registering as general postal voters on the basis of the distance of their place of residence from a polling place. I acknowledge that this does not exclude people living within 20 kilometres of a mobile polling booth registering for a postal vote, but it does technically remove the choice for those who cannot claim a reasonable reason for registering for a postal vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provision introduces an infringement notice system for the enforcement of compulsory voting at elections and referendums under which apparent non-voters will be given the option of paying a penalty, showing cause why they should not be prosecuted, or having a matter dealt with in court. This seems like a mobile on-the-spot fine. It is a novel way of trying to get around the provision; some people find it rather objectionable to have to vote. For a fee of $20 the Government is now allowing them to register their disapproval at having to vote&mdash;or, to put it another way, $20 for the privilege of not voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting&mdash;times have changed&mdash;the way that this Bill has been drafted. We see this in clause 22 headed `compulsory voting'. The terminology in proposed subsection (4) is extremely blunt and not in the best of taste. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>As my colleague Senator Parer pointed out, he held an honorary position when he was nominating and felt obliged to resign because of the uncertainty, even though, as I have pointed out, being in an honorary position, he was not in a position of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a clause has been inserted to define this. A clause was also added to provide that a person who is, on a nomination, an officer of the Crown is not capable of being nominated as a senator or a member. It is pleasing to note that the Government agreed to remove this clause. Although it was accepted that a definition was needed, there was also a requirement that people who nominated as candidates could get their jobs back if they were unsuccessful in the election. I think everyone would respect that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that the Government has given an undertaking to introduce some sort of legislation between now and the next election to get rid of this uncertainty. We look forward to that. I remind the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who I know has a very keen interest in this area, that, having been given that undertaking, we do expect that legislation before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned earlier, clause 12 was designed specifically to avoid the courts voiding an election result because the senator or member was not an Australian citizen. That too clears up a misunderstanding that may have occurred in a recent case. I have alluded to proposed section 17 relating to the use of licensed premises. This makes sense in remote areas but clearly it should be used only when alternative premises are not available. I am sure that the Electoral Office will be mindful of that when it chooses to use such premises. Some people in the community would be very concerned were this to happen even when alternative premises were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned earlier, clause 21 also brings in the whole question of the on-the-spot fine approach for the privilege of having the right not to vote. Again, it may seem a streamlining method of allowing those who do not want that right not to vote, but I think it does leave the Government open to a question on a wider issue, which I do not wish to canvass too much today. Nonetheless, it has been a matter of some public debate and, no doubt, will continue to be a matter of some public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those are the key points in this Bill. As I said at the beginning, it is disappointing to note that it has taken the Government 2 1/2 years to get to the point of bringing this legislation in. No doubt that has been a cause of some frustration to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has been looking into the whole question of electoral and referendum practice. The Minister, in his summation, might be able to explain why it has taken so long. The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Bill and will not be opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I rise to speak in support of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991. I will respond to some comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and, in particular, his criticism that the Government has been rather slow in introducing the legislation to implement the report which I delivered in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that one of the major reasons for the delay was the great length of time taken with previous legislation dealing with electoral matters and referenda. I recall that it took a number of years before the Senate was prepared to deal with legislation on these matters in the past. While the legislation might have been passed more quickly if the Government had introduced this legislative package more quickly, perhaps in the past the Government has had its fingers burnt simply due to the fact that the Senate seems to set its own timetable, irrespective of the Government's views on what might be important legislation. If the honourable member for Wannon looks at the past record of the Senate in dealing with electoral and referenda legislation, he might understand why it has taken so long for this House to debate this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that we have quite a few primary school students in the gallery this afternoon. I am sure that, like me, the honourable member for Wannon and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who is at the table, will have the opportunity, at times, to speak to primary school students, especially year 6 students who study government as part of their course. Some of the students who are studying that course might be here this afternoon. I certainly know that, in some schools in my electorate, teachers conduct mock elections. Some students are appointed electoral officers and others are appointed polling clerks. They conduct an election campaign with people standing for one party or another. I sometimes suspect that some of the students know more about the conduct of elections than their parents who actually get the right to vote for Federal, State and local governments. I think that is to be commended. The more students who are going through schools now learn about government and our electoral processes, the healthier our democracy will be in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also comment on some matters which have come to light during the case before the Court of Disputed Returns in New South Wales. I will be very careful not to canvass matters which Mr Justice Slattery might be considering at the moment before he brings down his very important decision on whether by-elections are necessary in the State seats of The Entrance and Maitland, which may ultimately decide the fate of the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Deputy State Electoral Officer of New South Wales has been quoted in the newspapers as saying that it is not possible to run a perfect election any more. I think he made those comments after a number of errors were exposed at that court. I do not wish to deal with the detail of those errors, except to say that I think Mr Wasson has pointed the finger at the Australian Electoral Commission in some matters. When the margins in seats in this House are as low as eight or nine, certainly single digit numbers in some cases, we have to ensure that the least possible number of errors are made by our polling staff in Federal elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested in the newspaper reports of that case before the Court of Disputed Returns that a large number of people who voted absentee and were enrolled for one electorate were mistakenly given ballot papers for another electorate. I understand from media reports that it has been suggested that the book of streets and roads for Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission, was different for the last State election than for previous Federal and State elections. The fact that not every street and road was listed in that book but only streets and roads in localities that were split between electorates may have resulted in polling staff becoming confused or being less willing to look up every absentee voter's proper electorate. That may have resulted in the extraordinarily large number of people who voted absentee being given ballot papers for the wrong electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern would be&mdash;I am not saying this is accurate; I am simply relying on newspaper reports&mdash;that, if a change was made to the book that we all know as the book of streets and roads for the last New South Wales State election, a similar error might result in difficulties at the next Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am reluctant to interrupt the honourable member, but I think he is going very close to canvassing issues that are before the Court of Disputed Returns. I feel that you should intervene because, if this matter is going before the court, I do not think it is proper for this Parliament to be discussing issues that are going to be judged by that court.</PARA></TALK.START>

I know that he is also conscious of the need not to transgress. I think his comments have mainly referred to what might happen at a Federal election rather than the specific issues under consideration in New South Wales. As long as he continues in that vein, his comments are in order. If he goes too close to what is happening in New South Wales, his comments will, of course, be out of order. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will abide by your ruling. My main concern is that, at the next Federal election, the book that lists all the streets and roads for my electorate and other electorates in New South Wales, Victoria and other States seeks to ensure that people who vote absentee are given the correct ballot paper. If any change is proposed from the last Federal election, I think the Electoral Commission has a responsibility to ensure that those changes are not likely to result in people being given the wrong ballot paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are not aware that under Federal legislation it is possible for people to move within their subdivision and not advise the Electoral Office that their address has altered. Perhaps a more accurate way to put it would be that there has been some confusion about the legality of this in the past. I understand it is the policy of the Electoral Office to sometimes have different correspondence sent to people who change their address but stay within the one subdivision. I understand that this Bill suggests that there should be a streamlined processing of electoral enrolment forms in cases where enrolment is claimed for a subdivision for which the claimant is already enrolled. That might help to clarify this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful that we do not let constituents think that they should not advise the Electoral Commission of changes in their addresses. I think we have to be careful that people understand that they have a responsibility to keep their involvement accurate and up to date. The Electoral Commission should not do anything to create any confusion in the minds of voters about those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of candidates enrolling for elections, this Bill will enable the registered officer or the deputy registered officer of registered political parties to lodge the nominations of parties' endorsed candidates up to 48 hours before the close of nominations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Wannon suggested, there was one famous case where a candidate, the former Minister for health in the New South Wales State Government, Harry Jago, neglected to put in his nomination for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. According to a report I read in one of the Sydney newspapers, Mr Jago recently finished a book on this matter. I suspect that the finger was pointed at the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who, Mr Jago thought, had the responsibility as the then State Secretary of the Liberal Party of New South Wales to advise him when nominations closed. I suspect that the view of the honourable member for Mackellar is that he in fact fulfilled his duties and that the failure to put in the nomination was Mr Jago's error in failing to nominate by the due date back in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly reassuring to members of this House and, I am sure, to the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table, that we can rely on the registered officer or the deputy registered officer of our Party to ensure that we do not in fact forget to enrol. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister at the table suggests, we have someone, Mr John Della Bosca, to ensure that does not happen. The legislation also seeks to alter the nomination form for candidates for the Australian Parliament. In the past we have asked people to indicate whether they are Australian citizens. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, people who are not Australian citizens are not eligible to stand for the Australian Parliament. We have not asked people in the past to tell us whether they are Australian citizens by birth, by naturalisation or by other means. I am not quite sure what those other means might be, but this Bill requires candidates to signify very clearly why they believe they are Australian citizens. It sets very severe penalties of $3,000 or imprisonment for six months, or both, if people put down any misleading information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came about, of course, because of the famous case where Robert Wood was elected from New South Wales to the Australian Senate at the 1987 election. Unbeknownst to the good senator, he was a British citizen. I understand that because he received a call up notice during the Vietnam war he thought he had Australian citizenship. It was only when he sought to obtain an Australian passport that he discovered his parents had not naturalised him, that he was not an Australian citizen and, therefore, was not eligible to be a member of the Senate. We all know that that meant that he lost his position as a senator in this Parliament. This legislation seeks to force candidates to state why they believe they are Australian citizens and it sets severe penalties for people who deliberately provide misleading information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also ensures that if someone with a silent enrolment stands for Parliament the confidentiality of their home address is not breached. The honourable member for Wannon made a gratuitous remark about this being a sad state of affairs&mdash;that, given eight years of Labor government, people who stand for the Australian Parliament cannot be confident of public order and safety and cannot put their address on the nomination forms and have it published in all the local papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the honourable member's comment but perhaps he is not aware that a number of members of this House have received threats. I think a former Deputy Prime Minister, Lionel Bowen, at one stage received a number of threats. Where a member of this House believes it is necessary to obtain a silent enrolment, I do not think we should seek to undermine the provisions of silent enrolment by forcing the names and home addresses of people to be published in local newspapers in their electorates at election time. No doubt the honourable member for Wannon at various stages has received threatening or insulting letters in the past, given some of the stands he has taken on wool and other matters. Perhaps with that background he might understand why it may not be appropriate to blame the Labor Government for the fact that some people out there, for whatever reasons, decide to send threatening letters to members or to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member expressed a number of concerns about enabling licensed premises to be used as polling booths. Like him, I was a little concerned about this measure when I first heard about it. The Committee obtained evidence from former electoral commissioner Dr Colin Hughes. My recollection is that there was some difficulty at one stage in obtaining a suitable polling booth at Thredbo. The entire resort was declared a licensed premise. I know that the resort of Thredbo would be very well known to the honourable member for Wannon, given that previous Liberal Party conferences have been held at that resort for senior and up and coming Liberals. It is important, should there be an election at some stage in the future, that parts of licensed premises be able to be declared polling places. Of course, it is a condition that no alcohol can be sold or consumed in the polling booth and that the part of the premises used for polling is to be segregated from areas where alcohol is sold or consumed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last comment I wish to make in the short time available to me deals with redistributions. I note that the legislation provides for some alterations to provide for electoral boundaries to be drawn in the Act. There are some other matters affecting redistributions. My comment on this has been triggered by statements made by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) during the last sitting week after the release of the final boundaries for South Australia. The honourable member for Boothby claimed that his Party did not fare well under that distribution and that his Party would win fewer than half of the seats should it obtain more than half of the two-party preferred vote in South Australia. Therefore, he considered that the boundaries were unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt when the final boundaries for New South Wales are released statements may be made by one party or another that the boundaries help the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Party. I know that would not happen in Queensland. We all know that boundaries in Queensland are always honest and fair, especially for your Party, Mr Deputy Speaker. But certainly some people have alleged that boundaries might favour one party or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that when I served on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform under Senator Robert Ray the former Liberal senator John Carrick asked Dr Hughes whether the electoral commissioners took any notice whatsoever of the political implications of their decisions in drawing boundaries during redistributions. Dr Hughes made it very clear that he thought it would be improper and would create additional difficulties and tensions for the electoral commissioner and the body given the job of drawing boundaries if they were required to sit down and start looking at the political implications of altering lines on maps. I think that is an important principle. Perhaps the honourable member for Boothby was not aware of that, given that it was evidence taken at a committee in a previous Parliament&mdash;evidence that I suspect Sir John Carrick strongly supported, given that all of us felt there should be no political considerations by the electoral commissioners when drawing up boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances it is a bit unfair to criticise electoral commissioners if boundaries have gone in a way which is unsatisfactory for one party or another. Those people would be satisfied only when electoral commissioners were given instructions that boundaries must meet a certain set of political standards that might have to make them satisfactory to one political party or all political parties. I think that is something which would be regretted. I do not think electoral commissioners should pay any attention whatsoever to the political implications of changes which they might recommend. With those statements I am more than happy to support this legislation. I am pleased to see that it has the support of the Opposition this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1991 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum Act 1984. It gives effect to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as a result of its inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and the 1988 referendum. I notice that it has been generally regarded as a non-contentious Bill by most speakers. It was certainly seen that way in the Senate. I notice that even the Parliamentary Library's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> refers to it as being non-contentious. That is a very sad commentary on this institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this Bill shows two main things. Firstly, it shows the total failure of self-regulation at any level of society. It is a perfect example of the adage that when people of the same business or occupation sit around a table to discuss things, we can be quite sure it will be a conspiracy against the public. Secondly, the Bill shows the need for an independent review of our whole electoral system. Anyone who takes an impartial view knows that electoral systems in Australia at all levels&mdash;local, State and Federal government&mdash;are in an unholy mess. They all vary in all sorts of incredible ways. They are the results of many years of the various people who are in power trying to manipulate the system. They vary in all jurisdictions. We have a perfect example, referred to by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in the confusion that existed in New South Wales because of interference in the electoral system there. If this Parliament had any real concern about elections with regard to their fairness and democratic principles, it would be looking to have a major inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dobell referred to the fairly foolish little outburst from the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) when he shed crocodile tears about what is happening in South Australia. Anyone who understands the first thing about electoral systems knows that numbers of seats in parliaments where we have single member electorates never reflect voting patterns. We have the example here of the present Government having 39.2 per cent of the vote and 52 per cent of the seats. In any single member electorate system we will always get wide variations. The whole history of parliaments at all levels has shown that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal in detail with some of the clauses of the Bill. Clause 11 refers to incumbent members or senators who have the right to declare either their place of living or enrolled addresses when nominating if they are enrolled for an electorate other than the one in which they are living. This is an extension of the unwarranted right of incumbent members to vote in an electorate in which they do not live. I take the view that if one is going to represent an electorate one has to be part of that electorate and part of that community. The amendment would allow incumbent candidates to mislead the electors as to their connections with the electorate. It opposes any form of open government and it is a very petty attempt to allow members to hide the fact that they do not live in their electorate. In many elections we have seen that people go to great lengths to try to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 provides a new mode of nomination for House of Representatives candidates endorsed by a registered political party. It allows a registered officer of a party to lodge the nomination of all candidates endorsed by the party. Again I can understand the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell, because he would obviously see things in party terms. What happened to Harry Jago in New South Wales is a tragedy. I tend to see this as a further intrusion by the political parties into the electoral systems and an extension of the special position of political parties in the whole system. Very rapidly over the last few years parties have become an integral part of the administration of government, yet they are really a body totally outside the Parliament and the whole administration. This amendment tightens the party's control on candidates and it is a further enhancement of party power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment further erodes the principle of electoral representation and responsibility. Party candidates will not have to concern themselves with lodging their nominations. Some parties may even impose rules preventing their candidates lodging nominations individually. Political parties are not recognised in the Constitution but a succession of laws passed by party-dominated parliaments have entrenched the parties in the system and given them special advantages. That is now showing up very strongly in public funding for elections and access to taxpayers' funds for party purposes, for instance, travel to party meetings. This amendment continues the process. The Electoral Act gives a definition of `political party', and recognises the registered officer, the secretary and the agent of a party. Indeed, much of the party structure now receives statutory recognition. The Act provides for the registration of parties and mentions the term `party' well over 200 times. A whole part of the Act, part 11, is devoted exclusively to political parties, as are many provisions relating to funding and disclosure. Parties should be right outside the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under clause 13, candidates will be required to state in their nominations whether they became an Australian citizen by birth, naturalisation or other means and to supply relevant particulars. There is obviously no objection to requiring candidates to provide proof of citizenship, but it is quite another thing to ask people how their citizenship was acquired. The amendment is intended to avoid the situation where Robert Wood sat in the Senate for some months before it was realised that he was not a citizen and therefore not qualified to be a senator. The amendment does make candidates turn their minds to this aspect when nominating and it does provide some basis for assessment of their citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is objectionable because it differentiates between candidates according to how they acquired their citizenship&mdash;by birth or naturalisation. Once people have acquired Australian citizenship they should not be required to make public declarations as to how they came by it. Candidates for elections are already required to declare their citizenship at the time of nomination and that should be sufficient, provided they provide some proof of it. Robert Wood thought he was a citizen, as he was entitled to vote. As a British subject, up until 1984 he would have been entitled to take his seat in Parliament if elected. Considering the isolated nature of the Robert Wood case and the publicity given to it, this amendment is quite an over-reaction; it also introduces that new and objectionable character to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under clause 14, a silent enrolment address will not have to be publicly announced at the close of nominations. People who are vulnerable, due to their occupation&mdash;for example, Family Court judges&mdash;certainly have some grounds for silent enrolment on the electoral roll. However, if they nominate for election to Parliament I think they have to abandon any claim to secrecy and privacy. Silent enrolment on the electoral roll should be denied to any elected representative. If we are attempting to argue, as the honourable member for Dobell did, that our society has deteriorated to such a point that that is necessary, we are dealing with the symptoms and not the disease. It is fundamental that the electoral address and home address of anyone who is representing people be known. Electors have a right to know where their representatives live. Being a parliamentary candidate or a representative carries responsibilities, including the responsibility to be accessible to the electors. That responsibility is not limited to business hours, as any member of this House knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 20 entrenches the right of incumbent senators who have lodged a voting ticket to have appear in inverted commas above the line on the ballot paper the word `independent' beside their name. This amendment continues the tradition of sitting members granting themselves electoral advantages denied to other candidates. The amendment simply reinforces the impression that the review is a self-serving one. There is no electoral or moral principle which supports the idea that an incumbent should be advantaged in elections in this manner. In fact, I think that is quite offensive to any democratic principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, clause 22 is probably the most controversial one. It provides for an infringement notice system&mdash;in a way, like on the spot fines&mdash;for the enforcement of compulsory voting. In practice, of course, Australia has never had compulsory voting; what we have is compulsory attendance at the polling booth. Once one's attendance to vote is recorded, one can cast a blank paper or, if there is no supervision, simply walk away without casting a vote at all. Compulsory voting has not been enforced with any rigour at any level of government in Australia, and the offer of a reasonable explanation for the failure to attend at the polling booth is usually the end of the matter. In fact, the continued acceptance of compulsory voting depends to a large extent on the system being observed more in principle than in practice, and the Bill will result in many more non-voters having to pay a fine, which eventually may lead to a rejection of compulsory voting by a significant section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should, as a matter of their civic duty, exercise their right to vote. But I think it is very questionable whether they should be compelled by law to vote. Australia is one of only five democracies in the world that compel their citizens to vote in this manner. I think the others are Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg and Venezuela. The overwhelming majority of democracies recognise that the right to vote also means the right not to vote. People should not be forced to vote for a range of candidates when they favour none of them or when they feel aggrieved or apathetic about the political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most democratic countries where voting is voluntary in national elections, 75 per cent of electors turn out to vote in the usual situation. In Holland, compulsory voting was discontinued in 1970, and it has averaged a voter turnout of 84 per cent since then. The supposed evil of non-voting, which our compulsory voting law is supposed to redress, is not associated with social deprivation or alienation. Non-voters tend to be the apathetic, the sick, the young and those who are changing residence. Non-voting is not really related to economic levels. A minuscule number of people would refuse to vote as a matter of principle. An unknown but probably substantial number of voters are grudgingly attending at polling places owing to the compulsory voting law, but it is certainly not proven that this serves any good purpose. In fact, it disguises voter disaffection with the system and increases the proportion of votes cast thoughtlessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no strong evidence to assume that voluntary voting would favour one side of politics in particular. That may well have been the case in the 1920s when the political parties of that era decided to bring in compulsory voting&mdash;and I notice, of course, that they hid behind an Independent member at that time who introduced the Compulsory Voting Bill in 1926. Where voting is voluntary, turnout tends to be much higher in marginal electorates than in safe ones, and that is the story right through every major democracy in the world. Voluntary voting tends to make it less safe for incumbents to take their seats for granted, which is probably one of the compelling forces that have kept compulsory voting in for all these years. Voluntary voting also makes for a more active and more motivated community involvement in elections, owing to the need to get the voters out. It may reduce the likelihood of voters being swayed by last minute saturation advertising campaigns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In leading for the Opposition in the debate on the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991, I point out that it implements Australia's part in giving effect to decisions taken at the ninth general review of the IMF quotas last year, where Australia joined a consensus of member countries of the IMF, firstly, to increase quotas in order to enhance the capacity of the International Monetary Fund to provide effective assistance and, secondly, to strengthen the measures available for use against member countries in arrears with their accrued obligations to the International Monetary Fund. Essentially that would involve the suspension of the voting and associated rights of such members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed increase in Australia's quota&mdash;its financial subscription to the resources of the Fund&mdash;is an increase of 44 per cent, from $A2.8 billion to $A4 billion. Lest this worries honourable members at a time of Budget stringency, let me stress that this is a financing, or `below the line', transaction which does not affect the Budget outcome. It amounts to the substitution of one asset for another in the national balance sheet, so to speak. The foreign currency and special drawing rights, or SDRs, purchased from the Reserve Bank and deposited with the International Monetary Fund count as part of this country's international reserve assets, as they did before the transaction is made. Of course, with the IMF, the asset is augmentable in the event of an exchange crisis actually arising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, the purpose of the International Monetary Fund is to promote a stable international monetary system by providing assistance, advances and loans of foreign currency to member countries in `temporary' balance of payments difficulties. That is very much in Australia's interests, particularly, as I will argue, in its current and medium term perspective circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what I have just said is worth stressing, as there are elements&mdash;perhaps the League of Rights and other such organisations&mdash;which look on the International Monetary Fund as a potential threat to a country's sovereignty and which run scare campaigns against it. That is not a justifiable attitude. Actually the IMF is a very notable context for bringing individuals and nations to confront reality and, in so doing, to recognise and speak the truth. Witness the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in the context of the recent IMF meeting in Bangkok!  He spoke out the truth about the Australian economy&mdash;that this is the deepest recession for 60 years&mdash;since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is worse than 1982-83, notwithstanding his assertions made today. The collapse in non-farm growth which we have witnessed in this recession is double the collapse of non-farm growth in the 1982 recession. So we do have the worst economic circumstances for 60 years, brought on by the wrong policies of the failed former Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in the event that the IMF is called upon because of an imminent or actual exchange rate crisis, considerable pressure will be applied for appropriate changes in policy to correct the situation. That is in the country's interest and also in the interest of the good husbanding of the Fund's resources. Again, over recent years large sums have been advanced by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in concert, for developing countries by way of adjustment loans. In those cases the advance has been conditional on the country undertaking to implement adjustment policy programs generally involving firm action to control inflation, changed government spending programs, reduced import barriers, the cutting of state subsidies and the freeing up of markets. For some that probably smacks of being a bit too `rationalist' but, as I said, it is both in the interests of the country and the interests of the good husbanding of the resources of the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently Mr Edmund Dell, a member of the Wilson-Callaghan Labor Government in Britain, which was first elected in 1974, published an inside account of Britain calling in the IMF in 1976. The circumstances were that in the 1974-75 financial year, government spending in Britain was increased on just about everything. Spending rose by some 35 per cent in money terms, 13 per cent in real terms, with inflation racing up to nearly 25 per cent. Unemployment soared thereafter and sterling went into free-fall. Britain proceeded to borrow from the International Monetary Fund the largest loan that body had ever made. The condition of the loan was a British letter of intent that `an essential element of the Government's strategy will be a continuing and substantial reduction in spending over the next few years'. Rationalist economics it may seem, but it was the only sound course for policy. In Mr Dell's book, it is pointed out that the alternative of a siege economy, as advocated by Messrs Tony Benn and Tony Crosland of the British Left, would have been much worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must have been something in the air at that time because here in Australia the year 1974-75 saw an increase in spending of nearly 46 per cent in the one year by the Whitlam Government, largely under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, Jim Cairns. I believe that was the definitive beginning of the thrust towards steady decline in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the developing world, to which I referred a moment ago, in the past week we have seen the long-standing President of Zambia, Mr Kenneth Kaunda, swept from power in the first free elections for nearly 18 years. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of 5 November, under the heading `out of the Maize', there is an account of Zambia's recent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. Maize, which is a staple food in Zambia, is in very short supply. There has been a corrupt regulation of maize growing. State marketing agencies pay farmers a relatively low price for maize, with the result that up to one-third of Zambian grown maize is smuggled out of the country, particularly to Zaire, where it brings far more. The Government nevertheless pays large subsidies to keep the price down even lower for city dwellers. Zambia has well over half its people located in the towns, thus being the most urban black African nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that former President Kenneth Kaunda accepted that farm prices should be set by the market and not by a command economics decree. But, having ruled for some three decades, while prior to this election last allowing free-ish elections 18 years ago, the President did not relish riots against higher prices for food with the upcoming election. The result was that, on 13 September last, the IMF and the World Bank suspended negotiations that would have given Zambia $US200m, which it desperately needs but not until the country should move to more sensible policies. As I said, the issue is not one of sovereignty but of a negotiated beneficial arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mexico is a significant example of where, with the necessary political will&mdash;but admittedly not without great pain and hardship&mdash;an IMF-style program can succeed. It was in 1982 that Mexico announced that it could no longer service its foreign debt. Between 1982 and 1988, the Mexican economy went backwards and the situation was a very grim one. It was in 1988 that President Salinas came to power, albeit in what was seen as a pretty questionable election. There followed a series of substantial policy changes. Levels of protection were cut; there was widespread deregulation; the budget deficit was reduced from the order of 12 per cent of GDP in 1988 to less than 2 per cent currently; and there was a very large program of privatisation involving the sale of nearly 900 commercial and industrial government enterprises. For example, the telephone network has just been sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This privatisation program in fact has `financed' significant growth in spending on education, health and urban and regional development, which has risen some 40 per cent in real terms, as I understand it, over the past three years. The country's foreign debt is now of the order of $84 billion, or 35 per cent of GDP, compared with 75 per cent in 1987. Interest payments as a proportion of export income have fallen from over 30 per cent to 18 per cent, which is less than the figure for Australia. This is not to deny, as I said, that there has been great pain and hardship associated with the process but, given the political will, the program can succeed and has succeeded to the longer term benefit of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reverting to our own situation, there has been something of a tendency in recent days to play down the significance of Australia's own large and persistent current account deficit and the vast build-up in overseas debt&mdash;or, rather, in foreign liabilities. As we know, over the past five to six years the current account deficit has averaged nearly 5 per cent of GDP. In 1989-90, it was 6 per cent&mdash;the highest in the developed world. There has been associated with that a more than fivefold increase in the overseas debt, with all our foreign liabilities, debt and equity, increasing to a net total of $176 billion at the latest count and still increasing. That involves a servicing cost, net dividends and interest payable overseas, amounting to 25 per cent of export earnings or about 4 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not dwell on the causes of that burgeoning current account deficit and debt build-up. But undoubtedly the basic cause was the persistent tendency for too much domestic spending relative to our productive capacity or, in familiar shorthand, too little saving, and that occurring in a context of inadequate competitiveness stemming from persistent high inflation and high real interest rates&mdash;hopefully we are getting on top of the former problem now&mdash;and an abysmal performance in respect of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The too high domestic spending stemmed from the policy of Labor, from the start of its term of government being openly `expansionist'&mdash;as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself at the time was wont to put it&mdash;in the pursuit of the `jobs, jobs, jobs' catchcry of the 1983 summit. Significantly and perhaps ominously, the same cry is now being echoed with the Victorian Premier, Joan Kirner, and the inconstant honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), an aspirant to some higher office, leading the charge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, the situation is one of jobless, jobless, jobless; it is a very serious situation and is causing much anguish and difficulty. The main factors pushing domestic demand in the early years were the Hawke-keating Budget deficits of 1983-84 to 1985-86, which produced a huge financing requirement. This was rapidly translated into monetary expansion, higher inflation, external deficit and a rapid increase in the overseas debt. For a very detailed account of that, one should look at the Tasman Institute's recent publication titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Treasurer Keating's Legacy</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second half of the 1980s, the dramatic overheating of the economy was the problem. This included a significant component of private investment, albeit too little of it in productive plant and equipment. That dramatic overheating of the economy stemmed from too low interest rates maintained for too long on top of a surge in commodity prices. In the context of the overheated economy of 1988-89, the current account deficit amounted to 6 per cent of GDP. As I said, this was the highest in the Western world. I note that, having brought on that overheated economy, the then Treasurer resorted to the murderously high interest rates&mdash;business rates in excess of 20 per cent for over a year&mdash;which led to the Keating homemade recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the balance of payments and IMF perspective, which is the subject of the Bill before the House, what was new over all that period, as compared with earlier decades, was the high international capital mobility with the integration of international capital markets and the elimination of exchange controls. Australia has been a notable instance of the willingness of international financial markets in this new environment to continue financing what, in historical terms, have been very large current account deficits and to do so over longer periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there was some drama with the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate in 1985-86, culminating in the banana republic comment in May 1986. There was even some alarmist talk about calling in the IMF&mdash;which again brings me back to the focus of this Bill. But in the event, the credibility of Australian economic policy was sustained. Credibility in policy is the name of the game and is what is central to marketplace success. Let me say that the sorts of leadership games being played at the moment by the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland are very bad indeed for the effective conduct of policy against the current account deficit and the horrendous problem of unemployment in this country. As I said, in the event the credibility of Australian economic policy was sustained. It was sustained because, as compared with the large Budget deficits of the early years, the Budget was brought into balance in 1987-88 and into surplus thereafter, albeit not, as would have been more desirable, by reducing the Commonwealth's own expenditure to any significant extent. Then, of course, beginning in April 1988, the disastrous high interest rates regime, which I mentioned a moment ago, with business rates in excess of 20 per cent for more than a year, was implemented and brought on this current recession, which is the deepest since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, albeit the antecedent monetary ease and the mix of policy, with too much reliance on high interest rates, were wrong, this was seen as tough enough fiscal and monetary policy to sustain credibility in the markets and with the IMF. Hence, the financing of deficits so large for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This still leaves Australia as a country at high risk. In my opinion, the recent more optimistic assessment of the current account deficit and the debt which I referred to earlier&mdash;including the Treasurer's Budget speech line that we were within cooee of stabilising the debt; that is to say, the debt to GDP ratio; the debt itself is still increasing&mdash;is misplaced and wrong. That would be borne out by the report brought in in the last day of sitting by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that we are at the bottom of the worst recession in 60 years. With national spending down by about 7 per cent and, in particular, with the collapse of business investment, of course imports have been significantly reduced&mdash;or had been until the last month's data when they very substantially rose, which was in the wrong direction. Exports, especially exports of manufactures, are up. But, as the Business Council of Australia has questioned: at what profit margins? Dare I instance the sale of Ford Capris? And with what sustainability as domestic demand revives? Dare I instance steel. I heard an executive of BHP Whyalla say the other day, `we are dumping the steel into the international market to keep the blast furnaces going'. There is no profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that there is deep recession. Apart from that, little has changed. As I said, ominously the cry of `jobs, jobs, jobs' is heard, and there is pressure for increased government spending to create jobs&mdash;jobs of any sort. That is a recipe for the repeat of the boom-bust cycle. Carry it too far and the markets will move&mdash;this is appropriate in this context of our discussion on the IMF&mdash;to exact retribution, in which event we could be grateful for a supportive IMF! It would certainly mean a continuation of the trend of recent years of declining living standards, increasing debt and, now, stubborn high unemployment. That has been the situation. A much better way is to grasp the nettle now and to implement the across the board reform agenda to achieve the fundamental change needed to meet the challenge to turn this country around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In very simple terms, taking a very long look, the fact is that in Australia we have had many years of complacency, to put it at its mildest, and a gradual slip from being a country ranking in the first half dozen of the world in terms of GDP per head down to a ranking of about 20 or so. Outside our high productivity rural sector which has now fallen on hard times and the mineral industries, Australia's standard of business slipped. Even BHP had to be rescued with public money after 1982. The rate of slippage&mdash;and I do not mean BHP in this sentence; it has pulled up its socks&mdash;accelerated in recent years. There has been a refusal to acknowledge adequately the reality of our situation. As a recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> put it, `the easy times have gone'. There is a vast challenge facing this country to work our way to a containment of the debt, to renewed growth and high employment and so to regain sustainable prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of that degree of optimism about the debt to which I have referred, very briefly in conclusion I would like to take a look at the broad orders of magnitude of what is required if Australia is to achieve low inflation, high employment economic growth, rising living standards and a reduced current account deficit so as to at least stabilise the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP. Without the benefit of a formal model, the broad shape of what is required can be put in the following way. As I said previously, the net income payable overseas in respect of the existing total of net overseas liabilities is of the order of 4 1/2 per cent of GDP. An appropriate growth path will require this to be met by increased net export production&mdash;from a sustainable transfer of national resources into net export production of the order of three to four percentage points. Time will prevent my elaborating on that, but it has regard to the situation that now prevails and the longer term norm 2 1/2 per cent balance of payments deficit that Australia can sustain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, we will be looking at a situation in the medium term future where total national production must grow faster than domestic demand, that is, private and public consumption and investment. National production must grow faster than domestic demand to make way for the sustainable increase in net exports. Now there is something of a consensus that to absorb a work force increasing in line with population a growth rate of total national production of the order of 3 1/4 percentage points per annum is necessary&mdash;say, 3 1/2 per cent to make inroads into the existing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to EPAC and other estimates, that is likely to require a level of public and private investment, including in particular investment in import and export replacement industries, of the order of 25 to 27 per cent of GDP. As the level of national savings has averaged only 20 to 21 per cent of GDP in the past decade, that will require a fundamental change in national savings habits. In the private sector the GST will help&mdash;and almost certainly sustained Budget surpluses in the public accounts will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, with a growth rate of GDP of the order of 3 1/2 per cent it will be difficult to contain imports to much less than that order. It is not a very easy matter to bend and reshape the structure of an economy but to effect a transfer of even half a percentage point&mdash;we talked of the need for three or four points&mdash;into net exports will require a sustainable increase in exports of the order of $4 billion or 7 per cent each year over a period of five, six or seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge, there has been no time when this country has achieved such a sustained growth in exports, that is, net exports over and above imports, and in gross domestic product. That underlines the magnitude of the challenge before us. I say again that this country needs urgently an across the board program of reform to effect fundamental change in attitudes, the law, institutions, attitudes to performance and work, and the striving in every corner of the land for best international practice. I add that there is also required the reassertion of what one might call traditional individual and corporate morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stressed the other day in this House, that process will be a long haul and it will not be easy. Fundamental change never is easy, but there is no other way. What is at stake is nothing less than this Australia in the future as a dynamic, prosperous, responsible, compassionate society&mdash;a major player in the fast growing Asia-pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) was about a very important subject, Australia's current account deficit, but it really was not about the subject matter of this Bill. I would love to be able to deal at length with the comments that he made, but fortunately my own views on that are published in a report which I tabled about two weeks ago on Australia's current account deficit and overseas debt. I hope honourable members will read that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are today talking about the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill. This is a very important Bill. The IMF seems a long way from Australia. We do not hear much news about it in Australia, but it is the organisation that has the responsibility for overseeing the global financial system. In this Bill we are asked to support an increase of 44 per cent in Australia's quota in the Fund. Overall, there are increases of, on average, 50 per cent being approved by all members of the IMF. The increase that was negotiated for Australia this time was 44 per cent. That retains our ranking as the thirteenth largest member. It is very important to replenish and increase the Fund's resources through this quota allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the Bill. The International Monetary Fund has a very important role in the global system. It is responsible&mdash;as is pointed out in one of its own publications which I was sent in preparing the notes for this speech&mdash;not only for overseeing the international monetary system but also for promoting exchange stability and orderly exchange relations among member countries. It assists members, both industrialised and developing countries, that find themselves in temporary balance of payments difficulties by providing short to medium term credits, and it supplements the currency reserves of its members through the allocation of special drawing rights. Those are profoundly important tasks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fund was set up after the Bretton Woods conference towards the end of the Second World War and has since gone through some evolution. During the 1980s it concentrated heavily on the imbalances relating to developing countries. That suggests some criticisms have to be made of the Fund. During the 1980s there were enormous imbalances and instabilities in the world. There have been high current account deficits in many industrialised and developing countries and there have been a number of countries which have remained in surplus for very long periods. Those instabilities have contributed, through the domestic adjustment policies that have been required to try to cope with them, to the depth of the recession, and, indeed, depression, in many developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an asymmetry in the way that the Fund operates. It gives much more attention at present to the problems of developing countries and too little to the problems of industrialised countries. The country with the biggest current account deficit is the United States, but who has ever heard of the Fund requiring the United States to change its domestic policies to reduce the extent of that deficit? That just does not happen. It is difficult for the Fund to urge its largest and most powerful member to change its domestic policies, but if it is to be consistent with its charter that is what it ought to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are asymmetries in the way that deficit countries and surplus countries are treated. There is much more attention given to the problems of current account deficit countries than there is to the problems of current account surplus countries. There have been statements that have urged more expansionary policies on surplus countries which would have had the effect of reducing the size of their surplus. I am not suggesting that the Fund has entirely neglected this imbalance but I think it can be accurately said that there has been an asymmetry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A common criticism of the Fund is that its policies are simplistic, meaning that the same kinds of remedies are recommended for all deficit countries. It is true that there has been a fairly high level of consistency in the policies that have been recommended and, some would say, regardless of the circumstances of the countries which are being advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fund's normal approach to deficit countries has been to urge them to cut public expenditure, to reduce the rate of growth of their monetary supply, to cut wages, to cut subsidies, to liberalise their trading arrangements, to liberalise financial markets, to privatise State authorities and, in general, to impose austere policies. I do not doubt that there are many countries where some of those policies, to some degree, are entirely responsible. It is quite clear that some of the developing countries do have overblown and very inefficient public sectors. There undoubtedly have been excessive subsidies on food or energy in some places. Undoubtedly, wages have grown too high in some places. But the situation is different in every country; there has not been an adequate recognition of that difference. There has been an ideological bias in the way the Fund has addressed the problems of countries it has been advising during the 1980s which has meant that its policies and proposals have been less effective than they ought to have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the developing world during the 1980s, and the relationship of the developing world to the industrialised world, to see many serious problems. Many parts of the developing world have gone through a severe depression. There has been a net flow of funds from the developing countries to the industrialised countries for much of that decade. In fact, the flow of funds from the debtor countries to the creditor countries has been substantial indeed; it totals around a net $US50 billion a year at present. That means that for the last decade the poor have been subsidising the rich, partly because the problems that those debtor countries have had have not adequately been addressed by the international financial institutions that are advising the Fund and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a deflationary bias in the policies that the Fund has recommended. There has been a consistent pattern of cutting government outlays, cutting wages and reducing services, in ways that have contributed to a slowing down of investment and, therefore, an even greater depth in the recession and delay in recovery. That deflationary bias has contributed to worsening the conditions of the poor in many developing countries; it has certainly contributed to reducing average living standards in many of them; and, whilst the Fund would argue that that treatment might well be justified by the benefits of the cure, in many of those countries the cure is not yet evident. The policies have been so severe that in many places they have contributed to worsening the situation, rather than leading to a quick, tough policy change resulting in rapid recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there had been the result that was expected at the time the recommendations were being made, then most of those developing countries would now be growing rapidly; they are not. It is true that some have pulled through. It is certainly true that the Fund's policies have been of great benefit in some countries. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) mentioned Mexico. It is true that Mexico, following a period of appalling disarray and depression, is now coming out of it and appears to be on a rapid development path. There have been improvements in a number of other countries as well. But it is also true that for most of Africa, and for parts of Asia and Latin America, those policies have not yet worked; nor, without modification, do they look as though they are going to work adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the policies of the Fund need to become more sophisticated, less ideologically biased and more attentive to the exact situation of each country that is being advised&mdash;in other words, in a sense, more pragmatic and more attuned to what each country needs. Of course, it would help if the industrialised countries were making more effective adjustments themselves. As long as there is an enormous current account deficit in the United States, and considerable surpluses in Japan and one or two of the newly industrialising countries, there are imbalances which exacerbate the problems. The Fund needs to address those problems symmetrically and also with symmetrical policies. It would also help globally if interest rates were reduced. I welcome the reduction that has occurred in Australian interest rates and hope that there are further reductions, both for domestic and international reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the central problems at present is that there is a global shortage of capital. That is, by the way, in sharp contrast to the situation in the mid-1980s, when it looked as though the supply of capital was growing too fast. But there is certainly a global shortage of funds able to be invested at present. The Fund could contribute to that by making a new issue of special drawing rights. Following discussions I had during a recent visit to Europe&mdash;in Britain, France and Germany&mdash;I understand that there is some increase in support for a new issue of special drawing rights for the Fund. At this stage that is not supported by the United States, but I think it is a policy that ought to be officially and rigorously re-examined, because a new issue of special drawing rights, particularly if it were targeted at the most indebted countries&mdash;or at the poorest countries&mdash;would contribute in an effective way towards increasing the global supplies of liquidity and reducing poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a considerable amount of room for reform. I think the Fund has learnt some lessons during recent years. The present head of the Fund is an extremely capable man and rather more pragmatic than his predecessor. I have noted, for example, that he has adopted a policy of recommending cuts in military expenditure to debtor countries&mdash;and countries in general&mdash;and that, of course, is a very wise thing for him to do, because military expenditure is a great diversion from social and economic development. The funds that are spent on armies could be far more productively spent on infrastructure. It is good to see that Camdessus was supporting those cuts in expenditure and actively calling for them at the recent meetings of the Fund in Bangkok. He received a lot of support from many governments, including our own, I am glad to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one symbol of some change in orientation. There is a recognition in the Fund that some of its policies in the mid-1980s were too severe, too sharp, and that real damage was done. There is a recognition that policies have to be more gradual. They may take longer, but if the poor are to be protected, that is an inevitable consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I strongly support this Bill because we must have an effective international financial institution that is overseeing the global financial system. Much that the Fund does is valuable, but there is considerable room for improvement in the policies that it adopts, and also it could enter new areas that so far it has not gone into. I am grateful to the Australian executive director's office for the help that it has given me over the years in providing information on the Fund, such as what it is doing and the number of member countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), I rise to support the International Monetary Fund (Quota Increase and Agreement Amendments) Bill 1991. Having listened to the speech of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), I note that he did not touch on anything at all to do with the Bill and the amendments that it makes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out for the information of the honourable member for Berowra that the International Monetary Fund was established in 1944 as part of a post-world War II burden sharing concept. Although the IMF was initiated many years ago, since its inception the Fund has been able to maintain its relevance and adapt to changes in the international economy while remaining faithful to its objectives. The basic objectives of the IMF continue to be to encourage balanced trade and, through its expansion, to stimulate employment and real incomes, to help countries balance their external payments, and to foster liberal trade and payments arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary role of the IMF remains the giving of financial assistance to any member in balance of payment difficulties which is prepared to undertake appropriate economic reform programs. It is in this context that the roles of the IMF and the World Bank are often confused. Both institutions seek to promote the economic development of the world's poorer countries. The World Bank assists developing countries through long term financing of development projects and programs and acquires most of its financial resources by borrowing on the international bond market. It also has an authorised capital of $95 billion, of which members pay in about 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Monetary Fund, on the other hand, oversees the international monetary system, promotes stability and orderly exchange relations among its member countries and assists all members, both industrial and developing countries, that find themselves in temporary balance of payments difficulties by providing short to medium term credits. The Fund also supplements the currency reserves of its members through the allocation of special drawing rights, or SDRs, and to date has issued 21.4 billion SDRs to member countries. The IMF relies on the subscriptions or quotas of its 151 member countries to enable it to continue to help members with balance of payment difficulties. Quotas are allocated mainly on economic criteria and closely reflect voting rights of the members. Australia has the thirteenth largest quota. The Fund itself now has more than $120 billion, or 90 billion special drawing rights, at its disposal in fully paid quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fully understand the relevance and importance of the IMF in today's international economy&mdash;and, therefore, the importance of this legislation&mdash;it is necessary to address the Fund's objectives in more depth. One objective of the IMF which has come to the fore in recent years is the surveillance of the orderly exchange of national currencies. Each member country must keep other countries informed via the IMF about its arrangements for determining the exchange rate of its currency. It must also resist putting restrictions on the exchange of its currency for others and pursue constructive economic policies which contribute to the stability of the international monetary and financial system, and foster balanced economic growth throughout the entire membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF surveys all aspects of a member's economy which impact upon its exchange rate and also evaluates the country's economic performance. In this way, the Fund acts as a guardian over the total international&mdash;I stress `international'&mdash;economy. The IMF also has the potential to provide policy advice to member countries, a valuable service to developing countries. The high level of technical expertise of the Fund's staff is a major asset which enables it to give specialised economic advice to members. The IMF evaluates world economic developments and contributes to international coordination of economic policies, particularly of major industrialised members. The IMF also runs an educational institute in Washington through which the workings of the international monetary system are taught. Representatives from any member country are welcome to participate in this if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal mission of the IMF, however, is to make funds available to its members to assist with balance of payments difficulties. The IMF has come in for criticism of this arrangement and agreement whereby members can receive financial assistance on the proviso that they follow the Fund's suggested economic reforms. For instance, the IMF has been accused of applying identical remedies to member countries, irrespective of their circumstances. The fact is, however, that there can be no standard remedy to external payment problems, owing to the varying causes of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a paper put out by the External Relations Department of the IMF entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ten Common Misconceptions About the IMF</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Fund can only work on a country-by-country basis and must tailor its policy recommendations accordingly. . . As a matter of explicit policy, the Fund does not take a position on social and political issues, but works within the existing sociopolitical system of its member countries. In formulating its policies, the Fund is concerned with the broad economic aggregates that promote a viable balance of payments and economic growth. In so doing, it will seek to adapt the instruments of macroeconomic management available in the country to its economic system.</PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes there are some similarities between programs, but this is usually because there are common elements in the problems faced by the countries, such as external payments difficulties, excess government spending and entrenched inflation. Also, delays in approaching the IMF can limit the available policy options. However, the Fund claims that its approach is not a rigid one. According to the IMF, it is always ready to consider ways that will help its members restore payments, viability and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF, in its aforementioned paper, stated that Fund-supported programs concentrated primarily on helping countries achieve and sustain a viable balance of payments. Achieving such an objective entailed some costs in the short run, according to the IMF, since a country must return to living within its means after living beyond them. By and large, the Fund's recommendations are aimed at correcting short term imbalances and improving long term competitiveness. Rarely does the IMF address areas which member countries have always considered to be the prerogative of national sovereignty, such as sectoral wage rates or individual government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF has stated that its programs encourage the elimination of inefficiency and waste, and clear the way for longer term structural efforts to promote durable growth in members' economies. Fund-supported programs are designed to achieve the necessary adjustment in a manner that is in the interest of the members' long term prospects. According to the IMF, the general conclusion of studies of the effects of Fund-supported programs is that they have had a very positive effect by improving the efficiency with which existing resources are used, encouraging growth and increasing the amount of resources available to the countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the rapidly changing and new international environment of the 1990s, issues of international economic growth and development, by necessity, must take an even more prominent place on the IMF's agenda. Substantial economic progress has been made in some regions, such as in parts of Asia and Latin America, but many needs remain unaddressed. This is particularly apparent in some areas of Africa, where unfortunately economic and social conditions have continued to deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One factor which is crucial to the economic future of developed and developing countries is the need to strengthen and liberalise the multilateral trading system&mdash;something the IMF has been endeavouring to achieve for many years. According to the IMF, the liberalisation of trade would not only boost world economic growth but also engender the stability and confidence needed by the emerging market economies of central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union as well as provide an important stimulus to development efforts in Latin America, Asia and Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefits of balanced domestic policies to be fully realised, the major industrialised countries must play their part in contributing to the growth of developing countries through the IMF. By maintaining their contributions, these countries help foster greater stability in the international economic environment and aid in the removal of international barriers to economic development. Following the international debt crisis in the early 1980s, financial assistance from the IMF was in great demand. However, loans which were meant to be short term have become rather long term as a number of borrowing countries have been unable to repay their debt to the IMF on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable the IMF to continue to achieve its objectives, it requires more financial reserves. The purpose of this legislation is primarily to approve the increase in Australia's IMF quota. The quotas of all member countries were reviewed in 1990, and a 50 per cent increase was voted for by the members. This increase in quotas will help reduce the IMF's arrears burden and will mean that the Fund is in a better situation to stimulate international economic growth and development. The proposed increase in quotas is therefore important for the stability of the international monetary system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By taking up our increased quota of some 44 per cent, Australia will be continuing to support the IMF whilst ensuring that our relative voting power in it is not eroded. For the information of the honourable member for Berowra, Australia has never borrowed from the IMF and is unlikely to do so. Yet our subscription to the Fund is part of our international responsibility. The IMF has an important role to play in helping overcome the many challenges facing the world economy and in fostering a favourable environment for economic growth. It therefore needs the support of all member countries for it to perform its role productively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other purpose of this Bill is to formalise an agreement Australia has already made with the IMF to accept an amendment to the IMF articles. This amendment will enable the IMF to take action against members who fail to fulfil their obligations under the articles, particularly those who refuse to cooperate in the repayment of arrears. The arrears problem has rapidly worsened since the mid-1980s and consists of overdue obligations of a small number of IMF members, some having been in arrears for several years or more. Arrears impose substantial costs on the IMF which require increased charges and reduced compensation for members. It is for this reason that it is so necessary for this legislation to be passed. By increasing the quotas of member countries, the IMF is relieved of some of the financial strains of having such enormous sums of money owed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, by making the suspension of voting and associated rights a compulsory step in the review process, the amendment to the articles will increase the IMF's capacity to deal with persistently uncooperative members. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 5 September 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia can be expected to benefit directly under the amendment to the extent that there would be a diminution of the arrears problem and therefore lower costs to be borne by other members.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a move which I am certain the vast majority of member countries would support. In comparison to Australia's current quota of 1.6 million in special drawing rights as of April 1988, Chile's IMF quota was 440.5m special drawing rights, or 0.5 per cent of total quotas, according to the IMF annual report of 1988. At the same time, Chile has used some 996.815 of its SDRs. This represents 3.6 per cent of the total IMF resources now being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose you may wonder why I am mentioning that particular country but, as you will realise, we have just had an inter-parliamentary conference in Chile and I was very impressed by the information that was available to us as a delegation from Australia. The funds lent to Chile by the IMF were not particularly earmarked for specific projects. Rather, they provided a pool of funds available to the government to lend within general guidelines set out by the IMF. As with other borrowers&mdash;and perhaps I disagree with my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;and consistent with the Fund's terms, the IMF imposed a range of conditions on the use of its funds by Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quantitative policy targets, such as the amount of credit growth, were imposed by the IMF on many of its clients, including Chile, from the 1950s. The IMF conditions at that time were generally aimed at controlling inflation and overcoming balance of payments difficulties. The conditions imposed on Chile by the IMF following the agreement to make funds available involved credit limits, budget targets, exchange rate controls, foreign debt, restrictions on foreign exchange, wages, and prices. In 1958, credit limits were imposed by the IMF on central bank loans and investments and on the issue of notes and coins in Chile. In subsequent years, the target variables were changed to aggregates such as gross domestic assets and central bank domestic assets. Throughout most of the 1960s, limits were then targeted at net domestic credit of the central bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mid-1970s, the target was again switched to net domestic banking credit, which included commercial banks as well as government banks. The only attempt to explicitly target interest rates in Chile was in 1975. The IMF also prescribed a range of limits to the amount of foreign debt held by Chile's banks. In regard to budget targets for most of the 1960s, the IMF required Chile to produce budget surpluses so as to avoid the inflationary impact of non-financed government expenditure&mdash;otherwise known as printing money. Conditions were also imposed on exchange rates, and as well the key objective of the IMF was to encourage clients to adopt realistic exchange rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Chile has largely maintained a system of dual exchange rates, IMF agreements encouraged market forces to be reflected in a system of pegged rates&mdash;that is, a floating peg to respond to Chile's balance of payments problems. At present, Chile's exchange rate is relatively flexible by international standards&mdash;partly as a result of these conditions of the IMF. Restrictions on foreign exchange were addressed in the terms and conditions under which Chile borrowed money from the IMF. Assistance given to Chile in 1956 was conditional on the elimination of restrictions on payments for imports. Later, restrictions on imports were permitted only for social or political reasons, not to alter the balance of payments. Wages and prices in Chile were also dealt with by the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim of all these conditions imposed on Chile by the IMF was to control inflation and stabilise the balance of payments. The programs aimed at controlling inflation which were enforced in the mid-1950s had some success, but the accompanying economic slowdown led the government to expand the money supply in 1958, leading to a surge in inflation. The same pattern was repeated in the early 1960s and limited success was achieved after that. There was a period of hyper-inflation in the mid-1970s and, despite strict policies, reductions in inflation were gradual. Chile's balance of payments position was heavily dependent on world copper prices, although the IMF pressure clearly led to trade liberalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Chilean economy has grown steadily since the 1960s, with that very severe downturn in 1975, growth rates were not particularly good by international standards. Periods of adjustment in Chile have been associated with very high unemployment rates&mdash;for example, 16 per cent during the readjustment in 1975. An overall assessment of the impact of the IMF policies on Chile is difficult due to the variety of factors at work. At present, Chile is in a significantly better debt situation compared with other South American debtors. The IMF regards Chile as one of its successes, with its debt problem under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chile's agreement for debt rescheduling in 1990 was expected to be its last rescheduling accord, and Chile's creditors regard the country as no longer having a commercial debt problem. At the same time, economic growth is relatively healthy and inflation, though substantial, is low by South American standards. However, the implementation of the IMF guidelines was uneven, and the last few decades have witnessed sharp swings in policy making it difficult to determine how much of the present situation was due to compliance with IMF guidelines or lack of compliance, or other factors such as world copper prices, culture or political factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a year of democratic government, Chile's economy has maintained its inherent strengths and is characterised by a remarkable stability. The Aylwin Government has continued the pragmatic and tough-minded economic policies it inherited from Pinochet which were designed to open the Chilean economy and diversify Chile's exports, thereby moderating Chile's historical over-dependence on mineral exports. A sustainable growth rate has been assisted by continuing very high levels of foreign investment. Although inflation increased during 1990 to about 27 per cent, it remained low by regional standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously Chile has been a success story for the IMF to a large extent, and is a good example of what can be achieved with the assistance of the Fund's special drawing reserves. From the research that I have conducted into the role and the objectives of the IMF in the international economy and from the very first-hand experience I have had in seeing how the economy of Chile is now being run, I thoroughly support this legislation and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government proposes to agree in substance with amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 9 made by the Senate, subject to some necessary amendments which are mainly of a technical and clarifying nature. However, the Government will not accept amendments Nos 5 and 10, which relate to an exception from the 30-day publication rule for Australian adaptations. These amendments are contrary to the most important reform being introduced by the Bill, namely, to provide Australian readers with early access to all overseas books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been long and detailed discussions with the Opposition in respect of these matters. I thank the Opposition for the constructive approach it adopted in relation to the Senate amendments. Amendment No. 1 alters the knowledge requirement for a defendant from actual knowledge to constructive knowledge. It is basically acceptable to the Government because it will bring the elements of civil infringement under the Copyright Act into line with the criminal infringement provisions, which was a recommendation of the Copyright Law Reform Committee, the CLRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government originally intended that this particular CLRC recommendation be considered with other remaining recommendations in the context of all copyright material, not just books, we can accept its implementation in the Act now. However, this acceptance is subject to a minor drafting change that will reintroduce the effect of clause 3 of the Bill, which states that section 37 of the Copyright Bill&mdash;that is, the main provision concerning the infringement of copyright by importation of copyright materials for commercial purposes&mdash;is subject to the exemption being introduced by the new section 44A. I understand it was an inadvertent effect of the Senate amendment to delete that reference subject to section 44A and section 37 of the Act. Amendment No. 1 will also substitute the word `importer' for `person', which is also a clarifying amendment. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>This amendment introduces into the Bill the right to import multiple copies of books at any time to supply verifiable library orders. The Government accepts and agrees with the intention of these amendments which is to not limit libraries to the single copy provision of the Bill. However, the Senate amendments introduce a new exception to a copyright owner's rights and it should not be ambiguous or have unintended consequences in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers it desirable to have consistent wording with the single copy provision in section 44A(3). The Senate amendment, as drafted, could well have some unintentional consequences. For example, it leaves uncertain whether the importation permitted needs to be for the purpose of filling that particular order. Also, the amendment does not prevent the importation of books ordered by libraries for the purpose of on-selling, as opposed to adding to their collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the amendment allows only the importation of the exact numbers specified in the library order. If the overseas supplier was able to supply only a lesser number, for example, 90 instead of 100, the importation would not be permissible under the amendment made in the Senate. We consider it is necessary to address these ambiguities and the inconsistencies with the wording of section 44A(3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also necessary to include a provision referring to how a telephone order or a statement relating to such an order may be verified for the purposes of both the single copy and library copy provisions. This is not a definitive meaning but provides that a telephone order or statement is taken to be verifiable if the person who takes the order or to whom the statement is made makes a written note at the time or just after the order or statement is made. Again, that is a matter which was discussed in some detail with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and advisers from the Opposition as well. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment introduces an opportunity for the publisher of a new overseas book to retain control over parallel importation without having to publish in Australia within 30 days. The publisher can achieve this control if he or she contracts to bring out an Australian version and can satisfy the Copyright Tribunal that the intention to publish is genuine and that it will constitute a substantial revision or modification for Australian consumers. If the Tribunal is satisfied of these elements, it has no discretion but to stay the application of the 30-day rule to the original overseas book for an indefinite period. In the Government's view&mdash;it is also the Opposition's view, as indicated earlier&mdash;this amendment would substantially weaken the basic reform being introduced; that is, earlier access by Australian readers to new overseas books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, we reject the notion that Australian readers should be deprived of that access to the original book for a substantial period while readers in other countries have such access. We do not accept that a publisher of a new overseas book not published in Australia in 30 days should be able to retain some control over distribution based on the intention only to publish an Australian version. If there is a perceived market for an Australian version, it will not be the same as the market for the original. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the Government's fundamental objection to Senate amendment No. 5, there are other objections in detail. For example, there is no time limit on bringing out the Australian version, so the publisher could delay the loss of importation right indefinitely. A bookseller wishing to import copies of any new overseas book not published in Australia within 30 days would have to make an additional check with the copyright owner or the Copyright Tribunal to ensure that an application had not been made. Further, there is no provision for interested parties, such as booksellers, to contest an application to the Copyright Tribunal. Another example is where the Tribunal is obliged to make an order&mdash;that is, it has no discretion if it makes the two findings triggering the obligation&mdash;it has been given no jurisdiction to rescind the order, nor is the order otherwise able to be terminated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senate amendment No. 5 and foreshadowed Senate amendment No. 10 seek to provide an exception to the 30-day open market rule in cases where a copyright owner entered into contractual arrangements to publish a version of a book for the Australian market. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has shown a propensity, in the period in which I have been shadow Attorney, to listen to the wisdom of my remarks from time to time, and to act upon them. So I thought that on this occasion I ought to reciprocate. In fact, when this matter was dealt with earlier in the year, I suggested this amendment and argued its worth. The Attorney has pointed out to me that, noble and all as the aspiration is, it could create a loophole through which many copyright owners could gain protection and not make books available. I have therefore put this to the shadow Cabinet and the Opposition party room and they agree with me that we should go along with the Government's reasoning on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the Senate amendment is to encourage the production and publication of Australian versions of international books&mdash;versions that are, through much effort on the part of local authors and publishers, made relevant to Australian readers. It is a point that I touched upon in the debate on, I think, 14 May, when I stressed the importance of giving short term protection to Australian adaptations of tertiary textbooks produced for the international market. What I am suggesting is that many technical works expressed with examples relevant to, say, an American market could be adapted in Australia with references to relevant Australian examples, et cetera. Whilst there was much merit in that, I can see that a loophole could be created. On reflection, and despite some distinct benefits in allowing such adaptation and putting the matter to one side for the time being, we now accept that the particular form of the amendments put forward by the Senate would, as the Attorney says, have adverse consequences that would outweigh the benefits that the amendments seek to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the amendments&mdash;in this instance, amendment No. 5 and foreshadowed amendment No. 10&mdash;would unduly restrict the ability of Australian readers and booksellers to gain early access to overseas titles. The mere making of an application to the Copyright Tribunal would result in copyright owners being granted an extension of time, and that period is not specified in the amendment. Accordingly, I agree with the Attorney's reasoning and the remarks that he has made. </PARA>

I think he has reciprocated in pointing out earlier the satisfaction that he had with the negotiations with the Opposition. There remain, however, different views between the Government and the Opposition as to how the whole matter of copyright ought to be handled. We take the view that the Government ought to be responding positively to the Prices Surveillance Authority's view that there be an open market in books. He has not done that. In fact, we go further than that. We believe that this Bill should have been extended to all other areas of copyright rather than adopting a glacier-like rate of progress in having this Bill deal solely with books. We would have extended the Bill across the field of copyright. Had we been in government and therefore had the opportunity of extending the Bill in this way, we would have been implementing the Prices Surveillance Authority's recommendation of an open market.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)It is contrary to the most important reform being introduced by the Bill, namely, to provide Australian readers with early access to all new overseas titles. It has been a very widespread complaint that there is often considerable delay before new overseas titles are published in Australia and that, in some cases, there is no publication in Australia at all. The Bill gives the publisher of a new overseas title 30 days in which to publish in Australia if the publisher wants to have control over distribution in Australia; if publication does not occur in that time, booksellers will be free to import copies without the publisher's licence.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The Government does not accept that, as is proposed by the Senate amendment, a publisher of a new overseas title not published in Australia within 30 days should be able to retain some control over distribution of the book by reason of having made arrangements to publish an Australian version. If there is a perceived market for an Australian version, it will not be the same as the market for the original.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before the House a Bill to amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act. There are essentially three elements to the Cash Transaction Reports Amendment Bill: firstly, the title of the principal Act and of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency will be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre respectively; secondly, a new division 3 will be inserted into part 2 of the Act to provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data; and, thirdly, section 15 of the Act will be amended to define the exact time when a person is required to provide a report to a customs officer when bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing with the third element first, namely amendments to section 15, in a judgment of Mr Justice Duggan in the Supreme Court of South Australia delivered on 28 June this year in the case of Schultz v. Taylor, it was held that the obligation to make a report under section 15 did not arise until after a person had passed the baggage counter at an international airport terminal. His Honour's decision accorded with the administrative procedures adopted by Customs officers in that the form for making a report was made available at the baggage counter and not earlier. In those circumstances, the opportunity for the traveller to comply with the statutory obligation to provide a report simply did not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 7 of the Bill will insert new subsections (7B), (7C), (8A) and (8B) into section 15 of the Act to define when currency is brought into or taken out of Australia. When entering Australia, currency will be deemed to be brought in once a person has reached the area in which passports and personal luggage are examined. Where the point of entry is not at an international airport or sea terminal, currency will be deemed to be brought in at the time the traveller had the first opportunity to provide a report under section 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed subsection 15(8A) will redefine the offence of not providing a report when bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia to the value of $5,000. The new definition of the offence will be in similar terms to the definition for bringing currency into or taking currency out of Australia to which I have already referred. I might add that the offence is a strict liability offence which carries maximum penalties of a $5,000 fine or two years imprisonment, or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should have said earlier that, whilst we have discussed the measures that will be brought about by the Bill, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill. The difficulty that I have with the provision that I have just referred to is that no exceptions are permitted for situations where a traveller, upon disembarking, may not be given an opportunity to provide the report. This was the very essence of the judgment delivered by Mr Justice Duggan in the case of Schultz v. Taylor that I referred to earlier. In order to avoid any injustices which may come about through this strict offence, it will be necessary to ensure that the procedures adopted by customs officers, unlike the situation which came about in Schultz v. Taylor, give travellers an adequate opportunity to make the requisite report. It is therefore necessary that those procedures reflect the legislative prescription set out in the amendments contained in clause 7 of the Bill, and I hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will ensure that this is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the operations of the Agency, on previous occasions when the Cash Transaction Reports Act has been debated, I have indicated to the Attorney that, in my view, the title of the Act is really a misnomer. Those comments were made in the context of the very wide provisions found in section 16 of the Act, which deal with the reporting of suspect transactions&mdash;transactions which are not limited to simply cash transactions. The amendments in this Bill will change the title of the Act and the title of the Agency, and it would seem that the Attorney now accepts that the use of the word `cash' in the title of the Act and the Agency is, in all the circumstances, inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During previous debates I have touched on two other matters: firstly, the need for the Act to be subject to a comprehensive review, particularly in the light of the fact that many of its provisions alter traditional concepts of criminal liability; and, secondly, a concern that the Agency may, through the use of section 16 of the Act, be concentrating on minor matters and not directing its efforts to the more substantial questions of tax evasion and money laundering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the first matter, it is pleasing to note that the Attorney-General, by way of a press release dated 27 June 1991, announced that an advisory group has been established to monitor and report on the operation of the legislation and on the need for any legislative changes. I congratulate the Attorney for acting on what, frankly&mdash;no false modesty here&mdash;was obviously my suggestion, and I await with interest advice as to the progress of the review being conducted by the advisory body, which I assume will be made available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second matter, I note that at paragraph 7.14 of its annual report for 1990-91 the Agency concedes that its earlier efforts were directed toward more minor matters. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CTRA (that is, the Agency) has generally found a great deal of support for its work. What criticism there has been was that CTRA has been concentrating on smaller issues. That was to be expected in the early stages since the readily apparent suspicious behaviour by persons (such as those engaging in Social Security fraud and the lowest scale of tax evasion) were the first matters to come to CTRA and were passed on in that raw form for action by the relevant authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>However, to give full credit to the Agency, it goes on to note that it now hopes to concentrate its efforts upon more substantial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal object of the Act, as set out in subsection 4(1), is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation laws. It is to this object that the Agency must direct its efforts, and this leads me to consider the third element of the Bill, namely, the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data. In an internal memorandum dated 26 October 1988 from the manager of the complex audit unit in the Melbourne office of the Australian Taxation Office to the Commissioner of Taxation, at paragraph 9 it is estimated that abuse of the 10 per cent withholding tax payable on income distributed to non-residents gave rise to a revenue loss of $1.8 billion per annum. That is, to put it mildly, a staggering figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abuse of the withholding tax system, which is the subject of income tax rulings 2344 and 2466 dated 7 August 1986 and 18 February 1988 respectively, comes about through the use of complex back-to-back loan arrangements whereby income is nominally distributed to non-residents but, in reality, is retained in or reimbursed to the resident trust or its associates so as to avoid the payment of residential income tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the wide powers that the Commissioner of Taxation has to deal with avoidance and evasion of Australian taxation, his wide powers to obtain information that may be relevant to such avoidance and the repeated claims by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), that this Government had cracked down on tax evasion, it is clear that inaction on the part of the Government to tackle this problem has led to a monumental rip-off of the tax system. It really takes a touch of exquisite genius to just forgo $1.8 billion in revenue. The amounts of lost revenue involved are scandalous. The Government, for its lack of prompt action in responding to the problem should, at the very least, be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1 July last year, tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls under the banking foreign exchange regulations monitored the movement of funds into or out of Australia. With the introduction of the foreign source income accrual provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Act 1990, the former Treasurer, in all of his wisdom, decided that the tax screening arrangements should be brought to an end. In removing the tax screening arrangements, the former Treasurer claimed that the reporting provisions found in section 15 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act would provide information relevant to tax avoidance. However, that section only applies to hard currency transfers and does not apply to international telegraphic transfers. The result of this&mdash;overlooked totally in the Treasurer's reading at that time&mdash;was to leave a glaring gap in the provision of information which may disclose an abuse of the non-residential withholding tax system through international profit shifting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its report of March 1991, found that, with the removal of the system of tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls, a gap existed with respect to the monitoring and reporting of international funds transfers. Estimates as to the revenue losses that arise through the absence of a proper system for the detection of possible abuses, of course, vary enormously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, in its report, indicated that it was not possible to put any firm figure on these losses and instead&mdash;and perhaps quite properly&mdash;concentrated on what needed to be done to address the problem. Lord knows what would have transpired and what the nation would have lost if a parliamentary committee had not been scrutinising this arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, in recommendation 19 of the report, it was concluded that a system of monitoring and reporting international telegraphic transfers should be put in place and that such a system be administered by the Cash Transactions Report Agency. That recommendation now finds its way into the Bill that is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, however, the measure under present consideration represents too little action taken too late. What needs to be tackled&mdash;and this was recognised by the Committee&mdash;is the source of the problem, namely, the incentive for abuse that our tax regime provides by distinguishing between residential and non-residential tax rates. The need for lower non-residential tax rates arises due to double taxation treaty requirements that Australia has with a number of countries. However&mdash;and this is the crux of the problem&mdash;the concession goes beyond that in that it applies to all non-residents and, in doing so, makes the system amenable to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a submission to the House of Representatives Committee, the Taxation Institute of Australia argued that the source of evasion in this area can be tackled by amending and utilising the winding up incentive provisions found in the foreign source income accruals provisions. In particular, the Institute argued that increasing the rate to which income is subjected from international profit shifting arrangements wound up under the incentive provisions, together with providing a guarantee that the general anti-avoidance provision will not be applied upon winding up, would lead to many existing withholding tax schemes being brought to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Committee also recognised that there is a need to tackle the source of the problem rather than its effects or consequences. In recommendation 1 of its report, the Committee concluded that the Industry Commission should review, first, the appropriateness of retaining the existing rate of interest withholding tax; secondly, the appropriateness of having a common rate of interest withholding tax applying to interest income earned in Australia by non-residents living in countries with which Australia has entered into comprehensive double taxation arrangements and non-residents living in countries with which Australia has not entered into such an agreement; thirdly, the equity of tax sharing arrangements between Australia and other countries; and, fourthly, the extent to which there is equity of taxation treatment between resident and non-resident individual investors. Unless and until these questions are resolved, law abiding Australian taxpayers will not be able to expect that all other taxpayers carry their proper share of the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is&mdash;bluntly put&mdash;an outrage that the withholding tax system has been a source for tax evasion for so long. It is scandalous that the Government has not faced up to the problem. Provision for the reporting of international telegraphic transfer data should have been brought in over a year ago, at the time the former tax screening arrangements and foreign currency controls were bought to an end. Australian taxpayers deserve a better deal. They will only get a better deal when the present anomalies and inequities in our tax regime are brought to an end and, no doubt, it will fall upon the next coalition government to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply&mdash;I think that, as the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), indicated, the Opposition is not opposing this legislation, the Cash Transaction Reports Amendment Bill. In fact, it was quite clear that the shadow Attorney sees a considerable need for it. I think that he addressed the most significant aspects towards the end of his speech. He first raised the question of the amendments to section 15 of the Cash Transactions Reports Act. That was the question arising out of the South Australian decision. He pointed out, as was done earlier in the second reading speech in this place, that section 15 (8A) then came into being and redefines that offence. It was at that stage that the shadow Attorney indicated that, while he was not opposing, he was concerned about the question of strict liability and the fact that there was no exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney mentioned the advisory committee which was established in July. He was not prepared to engage in any false modesty. He said that that committee was something that he called for some time ago, and I concede that. It is not called the Peacock committee, but he can take some credit for it. The ministerial advisory committee is there to monitor the operation of the Act, which will, of course, include the amendment to section 15. But it is a bit difficult at this stage to know what could have been done with that problem that arose with section 15 other than to have moved the amendment to provide for a new subsection 15(8A). Nevertheless, the point that the shadow Attorney makes will clearly be drawn to the attention of the ministerial advisory committee which will be monitoring the operation of the Act and the Agency generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has in the past raised a somewhat minor matter in a sense but nevertheless it is entitled, I suppose, to have an indication that some note has been taken of it. It is true that the Bill does amend the name of the Agency to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre which, as indicated, more accurately reflects the nature of the Agency's major operation, particularly with the addition of the extremely significant aspect of international telegraphic transfers as a result of this Bill. It is true to say that only a minor proportion of the Agency's operations will relate to cash transactions. Of course, for the same reason, the name of the Act will now be changed to the Financial Transaction Reports Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Attorney said, these amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act provide for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data. I know that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) was listed to speak tonight, but he must be otherwise engaged as he is not in the chamber. This amendment arose out of the report in March of this year of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which was known as the Martin Committee. It considered a lot of issues, one of which was this question of international profit shifting. It found evidence of revenue loss on a very large scale, with estimates of possibly between $100m and $250m. The Martin Committee recommended a system to monitor and report these telegraphic transfers of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters that was dealt with at some length by the Opposition and which was pointed out in the Martin Committee was that, because of abuses in the withholding tax arrangements, the likelihood of associated transactions being reported through the Cash Transaction Reports Agency's current reporting arrangements was minimal. Evidence was given to the Martin Committee that the arrangements operating in Australia allow Australian residents to avoid their taxation obligations by paying that 10 per cent withholding tax instead of personal or company rates of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that it is pleasing to hear that the question of deregulation in some areas has in a sense caused some concern to the shadow Attorney, who said that this sort of operation should have been put in place earlier. It is very pleasing to hear that when&mdash;if, whenever, maybe&mdash;those opposite come into government, there will be no more rorting of the tax system and that their record will be impeccable, unlike their previous performances in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the Bill does go a long way towards meeting the concerns which came to our attention as a result of, but not solely from, the Martin Committee report. Those opposite have said that this should have been acted upon earlier and that more action should have been taken at an earlier date. Of course, it is easy for them to say that from their position. But this Bill, particularly in dealing with the major matter of providing for the reporting and analysis of international telegraphic transfer data, will go a long way towards meeting the concerns that the shadow Attorney has put before us tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect to a number of amendments to legislation falling within the administration of the Prime Minister. The four Acts in question are the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act, the Public Service Act 1922 and the Public Service Reform Act 1984. The Opposition does not intend to oppose any of the specific amendments before the Parliament to these four pieces of legislation. However, as each of the amendments deals directly with industrial relations matters touching upon the employment of Commonwealth government public servants, it is opportune for the Opposition to make a number of wide ranging remarks about industrial relations matters generally and, most particularly, industrial relations policy in so far as it affects the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the Opposition to move an amendment to the second reading of the Bill and I will come to the detail of that amendment towards the end of my remarks. It will encapsulate the application of the Opposition's industrial relations policy so far as the public sector is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal very briefly with the four specific amendments in the Bill. The amendment to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act purports to amend the Act to provide that a woman on unpaid maternity leave, which can last for a year, does not become an unattached officer&mdash;that is, does not have her position declared vacant without her written consent. The proposed amendment is intended to bring the detachment provisions applying to maternity leave into line with detachment provisions for other forms of leave without pay. Staff on other forms of leave without pay cannot be declared unattached before the expiration of a period of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the provision is intended to achieve consistency between forms of leave without pay&mdash;and consistency is desirable&mdash;the notion that a position should be held vacant for up to 12 months is, in the eyes of some&mdash;including me and others in the Opposition&mdash;contrary to sound management practice. Under the existing provisions of the Act, an unattached woman returning to duty after maternity leave returns to her previous position if it is vacant. If it has been filled in her absence, she is appointed to another position as near as possible in salary and status to her former position. It is our view that provisions of this kind ought, along with a lot of other provisions, to be affected by the workplace bargaining principles that we would bring to bear on the Commonwealth Public Service. For that reason, the Opposition does not intend to vote against this amendment because there is some, perhaps tenuous, logic in the proposition which seems to be the basis underlying this provision that, in the name of consistency, while we have an inferior system, all elements of the system ought to be equally inferior. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment is to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act. We simply have no objection. It follows some recommendations of a Senate committee. It goes further than that committee recommended, but we do not mind that and do not raise any objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, the Bill makes two amendments to the Public Service Act 1922. There is a long list of amendments implementing the restructuring of the Senior Executive Service into three bands, increasing the flexibility of existing SES arrangements by devolving greater responsibility for deploying SES officers to heads of departments and agencies, and simplifying existing procedures for deployment. We have no objection to any of those. In fact, I am not the least bit reluctant in saying that we would support quite a number of amendments that the Government has proposed in relation to the SES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the changes that the Government has made to the Public Service over the years have had a great deal of merit. They have involved a good deal more flexibility being injected into the system. To the extent the Government has moved along that path it has been my consistent personal view and that of the Opposition over the years that it should have, as it has, drawn the support of the Opposition in relation to those changes. We do not intend to make or score any political points in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could say precisely the same thing in relation to the proposed amendment to the Bill relating to statutory authorities. The amendment gives a lot more authority to the heads of the statutory authorities. It devolves a lot more responsibility for individual executive decision making, and that is very much in line with the goals that we have in this area. Once again, we are quite happy to support, and indeed we compliment, the Government's going in that direction. I should, of course, note though that in his second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price) made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, all statutory authorities will still remain covered by the Government's general industrial relations coordination arrangements, which ensure the consistent application of the  Government's wages and industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA>That really spoilt a good story. If I may say so, my friend opposite was going very well until he added that caveat. I thought for one fleeting moment we were going to witness a great leap forward to flexibility but no, it was dragged back under the aegis of the all-embracing reach of the industrial relations club. I will come to that body corporate in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are my specific views and the specific views of the Opposition on four particular amendments that are put forward. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, I wanted to say something about industrial relations generally and also particularly about the application of our industrial relations policy to the Public Service. In the wake of the decision handed down by the Industrial Relations Commission last week, there has been a great deal of exaggerated and misplaced euphoria. It would be fair to say that the Industrial Relations Commission last week decided to do what it had declined to do in April of this year, and that is to embrace the very limited steps towards what it described, and the supporters of the decision described, as enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in the clearest possible terms that, to the extent the decision handed down by the Commission last Thursday provides for more flexibility than the system which it replaced, to the extent that it allows for greater account to be taken of productivity issues in determining wage increases, and to the extent that it encourages employers, employer organisations, trade unions and the ACTU to focus more heavily on the workplace and the needs of individual workplaces in determining whether and to what extent wage rates shall be granted, I support and welcome the decision. The industrial relations regime we now have is better than the one we had before last Thursday, but it falls a long way short of the euphoric reaction of some of the media in Australia and some of the industrial relations commentators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there will be true enterprise bargaining in this country only when it is possible for individual Australian employers and their own employees to reach an agreement regarding their remuneration, their working conditions, and all the other things that affect the way in which they relate to each other in the workplace, and to give effect to that agreement without having to receive the imprimatur, the endorsement or the legal approval of any outside force, individual, body or third party. In other words, if John Howard Pty Ltd, employing 20 people, wants to make a deal with those 20 people which varies the award conditions under which they now operate, and those 20 people willingly give their consent to that agreement and believe that agreement is in their best interests, then neither the managing director of John Howard Pty Ltd nor any of those individuals should be compelled to go off to a trade union or to an industrial tribunal in order to have that agreement rubber-stamped. That is the crucial divide between us and those who sit opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not arguing for an industrial relations regime which precludes trade unions. One of the great myths spread about our approach to industrial relations is that we, as a future government, wish to shut out trade unions. That is not the case. What I do plead guilty to is that we, as a future government, will ask the Parliament to change the law to allow individual Australians to shut out trade unions if those individual Australians want it. But we will never interfere with the law of this country allowing individual Australians to form themselves into trade unions and operating, if they so desire, through trade unions to achieve their industrial goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong about the present system is that people are forced to deal through a trade union whether they like it or not and whether or not they regard it as being in their own best interests to do so. We merely want to create a situation where people have a free, unfettered choice. I will go on arguing not only in this Parliament but also on every available opportunity I have around this country the simple proposition that the approach of the Liberal and National parties to industrial relations does not rest on some kind of primeval hostility to trade unions, some lustful political desire to destroy the organised union movement of this country, but on the simple proposition that in a free society the right to associate also implies the right not to associate and that free men and women in this country should not be forced by dint of a loaded, unfair law to deal through a body that they may in fact despite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that in Australia at the present time only 31 per cent&mdash;that is, less than one in three&mdash;of Australian men and women who are employees belong to a trade union, and yet despite that demonstration of their attitude, of their choice as to whether they associate or do not associate, 100 per cent of them are forced to have their award conditions determined according to the whims, essentially, and in the final analysis, of unions, irrespective of whether they belong to them or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have quoted in other places the example of a company in Melbourne that got in touch with me. It is quite a well known manufacturer employing several hundred people. Before Christmas of last year it was trading in very difficult circumstances, as most companies in Melbourne were then&mdash;and still, regrettably, are&mdash;and sustaining heavy losses.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially it put this proposition to its work force: `Unless we can effect some economies it will be necessary for us to retrench some of our employees. We put this proposition to you. Will you agree to forgo the 17 1/2 per cent holiday loading for Christmas 1990? If you do and if we are able to trade into the black next year, not only will we make it up to you but also we will pay the loading at 25 per cent rather than at 17 1/2 per cent. In our view, that is the only alternative to effecting some retrenchments'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposition was overwhelmingly supported by those in the work force, none of whom, incidentally, belonged to a union. Since the arrangement was a variation of an award, the company knew it had to get the approval of the Commission. It went to the Commission and the Commission said, `We cannot entertain an application from you or from your employees per se because they are not the respondents to the award; you will have to enlist the assistance of the union'. Reluctantly that was done. The workers did not want to do it, because they had decided not to join the union. They were repulsed by the union; they were rejected by the union secretary, who said that the union was not interested in promoting arrangements of this kind. They were left high and dry. The company was not prepared to enter into an illegal arrangement because under the legislation it would expose itself to prosecution as breaching the terms of a legally enforceable award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, as the new year dawned and because the arrangement could not be implemented, a number of employees in that company were retrenched. Nothing that was decided last Thursday by the Industrial Relations Commission would alter the chain of events which affected that company. For all the much vaunted flexibility that we were alleged to have been given last Thursday by the Industrial Relations Commission, the decision would not have touched that situation. There, quintessentially, at the workplace level, it was overwhelmingly in the interests of the employer and the employees to make that deal. But they could not do it because the law of this country does not grant that simple freedom to adult men and women. That is a bad law; it is a law that must be changed and it is a law that will be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making my remarks about last Thursday's decision, I do not criticise in any specific sense the Industrial Relations Commission. I have a different philosophy of industrial relations from that of the people who sit on the Commission, but that does not mean that I am going to lapse into personal abuse, which unfortunately has been the stock in trade of a number of the industrial players in recent months and which has achieved absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the present law, it is not within the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to create the kind of industrial relations system that we in the Opposition support. The only way that that industrial relations commission system can be created is for the law of this country to be changed by this Parliament. It is manifestly obvious that there is no way on earth that the present Government will ever put legislation before this Parliament to remove the representational monopoly which registered trade unions enjoy under the laws of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, who is handling this legislation, that that is the nub of the industrial relations debate. We do not deny that the present system is now a little more flexible than it used to be. We do not seek to destroy trade unions. We do not seek to deny people the right to join or not to join a union. We will defend that legal democratic right. But we will never concede the principle that it is fair, just or an exercise of the essential principles of freedom in this country for people to be forced to have their affairs determined by a body to which, demonstrably, they have decided not to belong. Yet that is what we are left with, despite the description of the decision that was passed down last Thursday by the Industrial Relations Commission as `euphoric', `trail blazing', `landmark' and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four essential principles lie at the heart of the Opposition's approach to industrial relations. The first of those principles is the one that I have enunciated over the past 10 minutes, that the law of this country should be changed to allow individual employers and their employees to make a legally enforceable bargain about remuneration, working conditions and so forth without the mandatory intervention of a trade union, an employer organisation or an industrial tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean for a moment that if those people choose to employ a trade union, employer organisation or industrial tribunal they will in any way be prevented from doing so. We are not saying to people that under our policy they will be prevented from reaching an agreement that might be certified under section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. We are not saying that if they want to remain within an award system they will be prevented from doing so. We are saying that, whereas at the moment people have no alternative but to be bound by the Commission and by the system and to deal with the union, under our system, if people want to go right outside that system, they will have complete freedom and opportunity to do so. For the life of me, on ordinary principles of freedom of the individual, I cannot understand why anybody would object to that, except as a result of an historical desire to maintain a legal privilege for a section of the Australian community. That is the first principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle is the implementation of the concept of voluntary unionism and an end to the closed shop. In Australia examples are legion of how compulsory unionism operates very effectively and very vindictively inside the Commonwealth Public Service. I never cease to be amazed when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stands up in this place and says, `There is no compulsory unionism in Australia'. In my office I have letters from people who responded to advertisements by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs last year for interpreters. Some people had all the qualifications under the sun, yet they received a letter from the Secretary or an officer of the Department saying, `I am sorry, we cannot look at your application because you do not now belong to the Public Service, and since we advertised to fill the vacancy we have done a deal with the Public Service Union about the filling of those positions'. If that is not compulsory unionism, if that is not a closed shop, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members on the Government side have the nerve to tell the Australian people that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism in the Australian Public Service. The Australian Public Service reeks of compulsory unionism. Why else would there be something like 68 per cent union membership in the public sector, yet only 31 per cent union membership in the private sector?  People have to be in the union to get on in the Public Service. Our view and our philosophy in government will be to bring that to a very sharp and definite end. People will be promoted on the basis of productivity and merit, not according to whether they belong to a union or to any other organisation. That will be our firm policy. That is the second principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is that the rule of law should continue to run and that all sections of the Australian community should be governed by the ordinary laws of Australia administered by the ordinary courts of Australia. One of the great advances that have been made in industrial relations over the past few years has been the establishment of the principle that, like any other bodies in Australian society, if unions destroy somebody's livelihood they can be made accountable for damages. That principle was established in the Dollar Sweets case, in Mudginberri and in the pilots dispute, when the plaintiffs were cheered on by the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will ever be a memorial to the Prime Minister's reformist zeal when it comes to industrial relations. One indelible impression that the present Prime Minister has made on industrial relations over the last two years is giving to a future coalition government an outstanding precedent, an outstanding and splendid example of why the laws of this country should never be changed to weaken the control of the ordinary courts over the conduct of those who would seek to destroy the livelihoods of their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final principle is that if those people who decide to join unions in this country are to have a free choice, not only should they have a free choice about joining or not joining but, having decided to join a union, they should also have a right to join an industry union, a craft union, or a company or an enterprise union. Once again, the present Government falls down on basic principles of freedom. Not only does the Government force people to join unions; it also forces them to join unions of its nomination and choice. It is a double jeopardy and a double penalty on their freedom as individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say, firstly, that the individuals decide whether they join or do not join a union and, if they do decide to join a union, they ought to be able to join any union they want and they ought to be able to form a company union or an enterprise union. How on earth can we be said to be moving towards workplace bargaining in this country? When it comes to union structures, we are going 100 miles an hour in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 months the Government has passed a law, with the support of its Democrats mates in the Senate, which says that the minimum size of a trade union in this country has to be 10,000. That excludes just about every workplace in this country. We cannot have enterprise unions when the minimum size is 10,000. It is a nonsense, yet the Government is trying to tell us that it has an enterprise bargaining system worth its name. That industrial relations approach has clear implications for the operation of the Commonwealth Public Service and that is the subject matter of the second reading amendment. I have already talked about compulsory unionism. It follows from our approach to compulsory unionism that we are against Federal awards of any kind containing preferences for members of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important step that we will take towards reducing the legal privileges&mdash;not penalising, but reducing them&mdash;which are now afforded to trade unions in relation to Commonwealth government employees will be to abolish the automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities. That was introduced in 1970. It was progressively suspended during the years of the Fraser Government and was reinstituted by the Hawke Government when it was elected in 1983. We will be making that decision as an employer in our own right. We will not be saying to private sector employers, `You should stop deducting the dues of your union members'. That is a matter for them. We are not in the business of dictating individual arrangements, but we, as an employer, can make our own decision to terminate the deduction of union dues, and we intend to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly than the things that I have mentioned, we intend to implement the principles of workplace bargaining in relation to Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities. We propose to devolve upon the heads of departments and statutory authorities the plenary powers that ought to belong to managers having those kinds of responsibilities. I acknowledge that the Bill before the House does go some way towards the goal that we have in mind&mdash;earlier in this speech I complimented the Government and offered my support for those changes&mdash;but we want to go further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the example of the Commissioner of Taxation, an example that always comes to mind when one thinks of Commonwealth departments that affect the citizen. We would want a situation where we said to the Commissioner of Taxation, `Here you are. You have X million dollars for salaries in the Australian Taxation Office for the next 12 months. You'&mdash;Trevor Boucher or whoever it may be&mdash;`go away and decide how many people you are going to employ, at what classification, at what level, and the combination that you choose. Provided you do not exceed the salary cap that we have given you, and provided, of course, you do your job and collect the requisite amount of tax, we are not going to be concerned'. That is the kind of workplace bargaining and devolved responsibility that we should move towards. On that basis, departmental heads will focus on productivity and there will be more innovative management decisions and far better morale in the departments and the statutory authorities. That is an example of how the workplace bargaining principles of the Opposition can be made to work in the Commonwealth Public Service. I move:</PARA>

The Bill amends the Act so that after the spouse of a Governor-General remarries she can continue to collect the pension she is entitled to receive on the death of her husband. Apparently, we are doing this because it is felt that the Act is inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act and discriminates on the grounds of marital status. I would have thought that this was a very good reason for changing the Sex Discrimination Act. It seems to me to be stupid.

Until now he has had to rely on the good offices of ASIO, which is not a basis on which I would like to rely. I think it is very sensible to give him the authority to command access to these documents. The amendment the Bill makes in regard to maternity leave is not of great consequence. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) says, it does add consistency to the Act, but I do not think it involves any great complication for the Public Service. It has been working around it fairly well up to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains an interesting amendment regarding Norfolk Island. It would exempt the Norfolk Island Administration from the Resource Assessment Commission Act. I think this is a very good step. It was never intended that the actions of the Government should be subject to scrutiny by the Resource Assessment Commission. I commend the Government to make this the first in a step by step process in which we can exempt everyone else from the Resource Assessment Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that details the relevant issues relating to this Bill. I move to industrial relations. I believe that the honourable member for Bennelong believes wholeheartedly that his party does not hate trade unions and does not have any desire to thwart trade unions or stop them. I accept that he believes that. The problem is that I do not think the Opposition has this view. Unfortunately, it just does not know. It is operating on the basis of ignorance. It does not know how the real world lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members a few examples. I will deal with the company in Melbourne to which the honourable member for Bennelong referred. He said that that company wanted to make a special deal with its employees. It sounded to me like a very commonsense deal. The company could not get it through because the Industrial Relations Commission said no and the union said, `We are not going to be a part of this'. Why would a union with no members in this particular organisation be interested in assisting? Of course, it was not. It was churlish about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that had that company had the support of its work force, as the honourable member claims&mdash;and I am prepared to believe him&mdash;it would simply have had to obtain workplace agreements between individuals. The reality is that no government, authority or union would have dared to take it to court. The company knew that. The fact that it did not go down that road proves either that it is particularly obtuse or that it was not sincere. If it is particularly obtuse, it is doubtful whether it will survive in the long term, anyway. What the honourable member for Bennelong put was an absolute nonsense and it is a sham to bring it forward now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then railed against this Government for saying that the minimum size of a union should be 10,000. I think there is a very good reason for this. I used to belong to a union, a very militant union&mdash;the FEDFA. I started off as a greaser and became an engine driver. In the mining industry the power in the union was held by the winder drivers. They could stop a mine dead. They, along with the AWU, were the only people who could. If there is no-one to work winders, simply no-one can go down a mine. This bestowed on them enormous power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members think that in any industrial negotiations the mass of that union had any power? We were in the hands of those winder drivers. History has made those winder drivers fairly irrelevant because most large mines today are open cut. But previously the winder drivers had enormous power. Had we had a much broader based union, we would have been able to outvote them, but here was a minority group which had enormous power and was prepared to use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If very small unions are in charge of key positions, people in elite positions will get into positions of power and use them to the detriment of companies. I know many mining companies want a unionised work force because it gives them a basis on which to negotiate. If one understands what actually did happen at Robe River, one would understand this&mdash;but I think that is tautological, Mr Deputy Speaker! The honourable member for Bennelong does not understand it, but I will tell him what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Robe River there was an enormously slack management, a company that had decided it would get in and rip out on a quick profit basis. The mine had been designed for a life of 10 years. A corrupt State government decided it would take the leases away from one great Australian, Lang Hancock, and give them to the Robe River company. This bestowed on that mine a long life. When we have a long life mine, priorities change from keeping things going at any cost and giving in to the workers on any demands just to keep things going, to having to consider wages and total costs of the operation. Unfortunately, the company had entrenched a system in which it had kept the effective unions out. Although there were union members, management and control were exercised by the shop stewards and the convenors, not by the union as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of the people responsible for getting the iron ore consultative committee up; I think it has been very useful. When we as a body approached the workers at Robe River, we were told&mdash;not only by the workers but also by the company&mdash;`Look, we see no future in this; we can handle things ourselves; we have a very good arrangement'. They were told it was an arrangement that could not and would not last. We know what happened shortly after that: a company was assigned to go in and there was heavy handed stuff. We now know the consequence. We have been regaled also with some of the myths. One myth is that this arrangement has given the company enormous productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of Robe River is that it has one of the simplest mines in the world to operate. It simply brushes a bit of dirt off the top of the mesa, down the side of the mesa, then scrapes the top off and gravity feeds that down to the trains&mdash;unlike a lot of iron ore companies which have to dig out a lot of overburden, which is a much harder job. However, productivity in CRA is much higher than in Robe River. It has an overburden problem, but certainly it has done better in increasing productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that a situation such as the one the honourable member for Bennelong apparently wants bestows on individuals enormous power to cause disruption. It takes only a couple of dissident Kiwis to get into a mining site and find a bit of asbestos, and all hell can break loose. If the honourable member were a mine owner, he would be very grateful in those circumstances if he had a very large union which was prepared to negotiate and see commonsense. I admit not all unions are prepared to do that, but there are a lot of responsible unions. The union movement has shown its responsibility in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then those opposite make a great case for free wage bargaining. I have lived through free wage bargaining. Back in the 1960s I was involved in the opening of the Nullarbor. It was the last great path of development that Australia will ever see. On that project we were stripped of labour. Why? Because of the unilateral action of the mining companies to raise wages. The mining companies tripled the pastoral award. They dragged all the good people out of the pastoral industry into the mining industry and left us virtually without labour. We were forced to develop the Nullarbor, which is pretty hard work, basically with drunks, criminals and pommies&mdash;and thank heavens for the young pommy kids who were out in Australia for six months looking for experience, who were not just chasing big money but were out for the adventure. Without their assistance the Nullarbor would not have been developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the honourable member for Bennelong is a two edged sword. When industry talks about its free wage bargaining, it means bargaining wages downwards. There is no incentive, no reason for industry to do otherwise. We have laments about the 17 1/2 per cent loading. We are told people do not get it in America. They do not. But in America people get a much higher hourly rate, which more than compensates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to make this country survive, we have to have an industry policy that is relevant to Australia. Sadly, the truth is that today in Australia the Labor Party has a policy that does not work very well and the Opposition does not have one at all. That is the reality. Without that policy, without direction in industry, there can be no future for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can ask what sort of industry Australia needs. Clearly it needs industries based on the things we do well. It needs support for the mining industry and the rural sector. I do not believe that in recent times any government has given those industries a lot of support. Honourable members opposite should not kid themselves. They will find in government that they are just as subject to pressure groups as any other political party. In fact, history has shown that. We need just look back at the record of Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having determined that we are going to support industries, we should seek to process downstream to add as much value as we can and then find industries that fit into them. For example, we should support industries that manufacture equipment that people need. This is the way forward for Australia. The Opposition has acknowledged that only 31 per cent of people are involved in the union movement. Obviously, if that is true&mdash;and it is true&mdash;it means that the union movement is not as all powerful as the Opposition says it is; it is not the thing that is holding back development in Australia. We must also ask where the 31 per cent is involved. It is involved, overwhelmingly, in the mining industry, which is very highly unionised, and, of course, in the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a sore issue. I think the Commonwealth Public Service unions need a thorough going over. However, people do not join the Commonwealth Public Service because they are dragooned into it but because they get so many perks from it. They would be mugs not to join the Public Service Union; it is one of the easiest rides in the country. I think that Clyde Cameron, who set this in motion, belatedly realised the problem he caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have in Australia today is the disproportionate power of white collar unions in the ACTU. But honourable members opposite&mdash;those heroes&mdash;are going to stop them collecting dues from their members. If honourable members opposite do that, good luck to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the problem. The Opposition needs to stand up to them and stop conceding conditions to them. That is what really needs to happen with the Commonwealth Public Service. I am sure that could be achieved. Instead, members of the Opposition prattle about increased productivity in the Commonwealth Public Service. What does this mean?  How do we get increased productivity in some of these areas? In some areas the last thing we want is increased productivity. Who would suggest that this country benefits, for example, if this Parliament passes more laws? Does anyone think this country would be better off if we suddenly doubled our output of laws? Of course not. Productivity is another one of those shibboleths which honourable members opposite hang their hats on. They do not really understand what it means. They utter absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the four industrial relations principles. One is the right to free association. In the context of Bertrand Russell's dictum, to treat equals unequally is discrimination, it is abhorrent and it should not be allowed. I am sure honourable members opposite would agree. It is just as abhorrent to treat unequals equally. So to suggest that a few employees will have the same sort of clout as some employer who happens to be unscrupulous is nonsense. But do not worry; it already happens in Australia, and in a big way. There are very many industries where one cannot get a job if one is in a union. It is made very clear that if one joins a union, one is out. That is made very clear to lots of people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would honourable members opposite propose to do about this? It is clearly against their stated guidelines&mdash;although, of course, in reality they support it wholeheartedly. The reality is that the Opposition could do nothing about it; it would go on as it goes on now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another principle is the right to bargain directly. What sort of a bargaining situation is it when the boss says, `This is the score; take it or leave it'? This falls right back on the fact that we do not have any real idea in Australia of the industries we want. I will make a few remarks about the industries we want. I touched on the major industries, the ones we carry on well. We are, after all, the best miners in the world, partly because of our climate. But there are other industries that are basic to Australia, and they are what I call the strategic industries, the industries that Australia needs for its survival. I refer to surveillance technology, communications technology, medicine, particularly tropical medicine, and transport. These are industries that Australia needs for its survival, and we should be supporting them. Neither the Opposition parties when in government nor we as a government have ever had any coherent plan to make sure that Australia is self-sufficient&mdash;in fact pre-eminent&mdash;in those industries. Unlike Israel, we have miserably failed the people of our country in developing a real industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite talk about the right to bargain. Now we have the rule of law. What rule of law is there when we have a large company with inexhaustible resources, tax deductible resources, to implement the law at every opportunity? It simply exhausts the funds of unions. What would it do to individuals? Again members of the Opposition are talking nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no great brief for the industrial relations club. I think the latest decision was an attempt at its own survival. I must say that free wage bargaining worries me, as I think it will lead to a blow-out in wages which will not be contained, except by the most draconian measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Opposition's former heroes, Senator Withers, said that if one pays people peanuts, one gets monkeys. That is true, and that is bad. But it is not as bad as paying coconuts and getting monkeys. That is what happens in a lot of these things. I remember Mr Bond saying, when he was paying one of his people some enormous salary, that he had to pay those salaries to get good men to make sure the interests of the shareholders were looked after. We have to be very careful. After all, we freed the Wool Corporation from the structures of the Public Service Commission. I would not have thought the Wool Corporation excelled itself, despite the higher level of wages received by its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What type of unions will we have? Is the Opposition suggesting we will have such a proliferation of unions that no union will have any influence or power at all?

I certainly will not try to upstage the contribution of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). One point I agree with him on is that this is a Bill which contains a number of amendments. It is a real grab bag of a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), of Acts containing provisions which relate to the Public Service, matters which have been dealt with by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few comments firstly to the amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. That amendment will make it possible, where the Ombudsman of the internal investigation division of the Australian Federal Police is investigating a complaint, for the Ombudsman to refer a question to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion. Currently, the Ombudsman does have that power, but he has to refer it through the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. This amendment will allow him to refer that question directly to the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment in this Bill is an amendment to the Governor-General Act 1974. It was referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The Bill amends the Governor-General Act 1974 by removing the limitation on the entitlement of a surviving spouse of a retired Governor-General to an allowance. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie took some exception to this. If he really looks at it, he will see it would be inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as it discriminates purely and simply on the basis of marital status. The surviving spouse under this amendment will have the ability to have it reinstated where she previously had no entitlement to an allowance on remarriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendments relate to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. There are three amendments proposed to that Act. Two of them are administrative in nature and are intended to bring the office of the Inspector-General into line with other statutory bodies. Provision is now made for appointment of an Acting Inspector-General in the event of the absence of the Inspector-General or of a temporary vacancy in that office. The second amendment ensures that should a person appointed to act as Inspector-General also hold a judicial office, that person may continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of that judicial office while acting as Inspector-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment provides the Inspector-General with the right of access to the annual or periodic reports of the intelligence and security agencies and to ministerial directions or guidelines given to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further amendment to the Ombudsman's Act 1976 caused the coalition some concern. I conferred with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). On balance and after much consideration, we decided that the coalition would support the amendment foreshadowed by the Government. Subsection 9(4) of the Ombudsman Act presently provides that there is no excuse for a person not to furnish information where provision of the information:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)would contravene the provisions of any other Act, would be contrary to the public interest or might tend to incriminate him . . . or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)would disclose legal advice furnished to a Minister, a Department or a prescribed authority . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Subsection 9(4) goes on to provide that such information cannot be admitted into evidence in proceedings against the provider of the information. Two exceptions apply: namely, where the Ombudsman applies to the Federal Court under section 11 for an order that the information be provided; and, secondly, proceedings under section 36 of the Act for the offence of failing to provide such information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will change the aforementioned provisions by giving specific reference to communications between a lawyer and a public servant&mdash;that is, in addition to legal advice being disclosed, instructions to a lawyer would also need to be disclosed. The safeguards preventing admission in subsequent proceedings are retained. Paragraph 22 of the explanatory memorandum says that on the basis of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, communications between client and lawyer would already be covered by the public interest ground referred to in paragraph 9(4)(a). This is probably correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test for claiming professional privilege in discovery in litigation is resolved by weighing up, firstly, the public interest in favour of full and open discovery and the administration of justice against the public interest in fostering confidentiality between client and lawyer. On this analysis, the amendments simply express what is already implied. Whether the existing situation is in itself desirable is a much broader and larger question. For example, a quick reading of the Act indicates that there are no express limitations on how the Ombudsman may deal with or publish through a report these forms of sensitive information. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price) who is at the table might address that question in his response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, an alternative argument. Parliament, in specifically addressing a form of privilege in paragraph 9(4)(b), has excluded other forms of privilege in that that paragraph, dealing with public interest grounds, is not meant to cover professional privilege. In other words, the express mention of one thing&mdash;legal advice&mdash;excludes the mention of the other&mdash;client instructions. If the analysis by the Attorney-General's Department is wrong, the only extension brought about by the amendments relates to instructions to a lawyer, as opposed to legal advice, which is already covered. If legal advice is to be made available, which is the present situation, the natural corollary to that is to disclose client instructions. However, there may be some inherent dangers in such an extension, given that legal advice tends to be expressed in cautious terms whereas client instructions tend to be more frank and open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a quick perusal of the Ombudsman's report for 1989-90&mdash;the latest report, that for 1990-91, has not yet been tabled&mdash;I can say that there is no mention of the need to address claims for privilege with respect to client instructions. The Parliamentary Secretary at the table should take note of the concerns that I have raised on the legal implications of that subsection and may be in a position to comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment in this Bill is to the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989. The Act is to be amended to remove the Administration of Norfolk Island from the definition of `Commonwealth authority'. The Norfolk Island Government is deemed to be a Commonwealth authority by reason of its status as an incorporated body. As a result, the decision by the Norfolk Island Government on a resource matter can be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission. However, it was not intended that the Resource Assessment Commission be able to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the view of my party that the coalition respect the fierce independence of the people of Norfolk Island and their wishes. Norfolk Island is one of the most historic of Australia's external territories and is integral to our national heritage. Norfolk Island has its own legislative assembly, system of local administration and law and its own courts. The Australian Government is responsible for its defence, its international relations, its heritage conservation and, ultimately, its good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Norfolk Island&mdash;I understand that the population is now somewhere around 2,000 in number&mdash;are a unique blend. There are descendants of the original Pitcairners, Australians, New Zealanders and others, with 25 per cent of the population being temporary residents. The legislative framework of the island has its own unique history, a constitutional battle for independence&mdash;that is what I was talking about, with our party recognising its fierce independence&mdash;which in 1979 resulted in the creation of the Norfolk Island Act and a degree of self-government for the Island. The coalition parties are committed to seeing this process continue. We believe that it has been a success. We would not want to see the Government giving the Resource Assessment Commission the power to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government. Norfolk Island has achieved a high degree of self-government. It has proved since 1979 that it is able to act with goodwill in developing a range of laws designed to safeguard and meet the express desire of territory residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of these measures contained in the complaints section, the Governor-General's section and the amendments to the Ombudsman Act, is not expected to be major. Similarly, with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security amendments the financial impact will be minimal. I believe that they do merit support. We had thought at one stage that the coalition would give serious consideration to moving an amendment to the Resource Assessment Commission amendment. However, in view of the fact that it does reduce the strength of the Resource Assessment Commission rather than increase its powers, we decided to accept the Government's amendment in this case. However, it is the view of the coalition parties that the Resource Assessment Commission shall be abolished upon our coming to government. </PARA>

I suggest that the honourable member should read the report from earlier this year or late last year of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Members of his Party were involved in that Committee and were strongly in support of the recommendations. Those recommendations are not in accordance with what the honourable member said were the policies and aims of his Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one other thing clear: the Norfolk Island Act set up a framework for self-government on Norfolk Island within the Act itself. The Act is basically the constitution of Norfolk Island and, whilst it has been modified over the years, it was fully in force at the time of the change of government in 1983. Norfolk Island had no powers over subdivisions&mdash;they were signed by a Commonwealth Minister here&mdash;and it had no powers over a number of aspects of the island where it was deemed necessary for those aspects to be protected for future generations because of the small size of the island and its inability to support a boom or bust type of economy based on a short term advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an island which has a great deal of autonomy&mdash;in fact, practically total autonomy&mdash;and I think that it has been governed responsibly by those people who have been elected to do it.

Whilst Norfolk Islanders may be upset about Australians on Norfolk Island being able to vote in Australia and may be extending that to a threat of independence, having been Minister for that area I believe that Norfolk Island is well served as it is. It has all the independence that it needs to do whatever it desires&mdash;except to destroy the island. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there has been a fairly wide-ranging debate, so, with your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will enter into the spirit of that in a moment. I will begin by dealing briefly with the portion of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill that proposes a series of changes that are intended to improve the management of government employees by increasing the flexibility of existing arrangements, by devolving greater responsibility to heads of departments or agencies, by simplifying and sometimes rationalising existing procedures and by clarifying perceived anomalies. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, members of the Opposition, of course, have no argument with the aims of this particular Bill in that respect; nor do we have any particular reason to object strongly to any of the proposed amendments. However, as the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out&mdash;I would like to pick up on some of his remarks&mdash;the Government's policy of devolution in this respect falls far short of the Opposition's commitment to make the chief executive officer of each department or statutory authority responsible for his staff establishment, terms, conditions of employment and deployment of staff within an overall budget constraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, what I really want to do is to support the Opposition's amendment and the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Bennelong here tonight. I remind the House that the honourable member for Bennelong moved the following amendment:</PARA>

Some of the propositions that I hear him put forward from time to time are, to say the least, interesting and challenging. He admitted here tonight the failure of the present system of industrial relations, but what he was not prepared to bring himself to recognise was how much the industrial climate has changed in Australia in recent years. There needs to be a recognition of how the present system has failed. Basically, up until the last few days we have adhered to a centralised wage fixing system. Almost alone in the industrialised world we have subscribed to and maintained the system. We are starting to recognise at last that Australia cannot prosper with the shackles and constraints of that system any longer. Even the Government has been dragged to a recognition of that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, members of the Government are only dipping their collective toes in the water of change in respect of industrial relations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big difference, it seems to me, is that there is now, hopefully, a new level of maturity in the Australian work force. The Industrial Relations Commission has changed its position on that, and I think rightly so, because there is a new level of maturity. I think someone on the other side of the House said once that the caravan has now moved on to the point where I believe that workers and managers can get together and suitably negotiate conditions&mdash;and it has been shown to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked for some time about abuses of power. There is that potential when there is an uneven playing field, as some workplaces may inherently seem to be. But, essentially, we have seen example after example of how, in today's climate, workers and managers can get together and talk about pay and conditions and come to arrangements whereby each is better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you know what has happened at Power Brewing in our State. One cannot argue with the fact that the employees there got together with the management and came up with an arrangement which was better for everybody. Of course, it turned out that the employees were earning $60 or $80 a week more than their union counterparts outside Power Brewing. What is more, the company was much more productive, and the result of that, of course, has been a success. One cannot argue with that as a model of success.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that particular example, but I would be prepared to look at that. If that is an example of where it did not work, then let us try to understand why it did not work. What I am concentrating on is the potential that it has to work if it is allowed to. The trouble with the people on the other side of the chamber is that they do not want it to work because they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. After all, they are here largely at the pleasure of union bosses and people such as Mr Kelty and others. We saw Mr Ferguson trotting around the world holding the hand of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and telling him what to do and what not to do. I can understand that honourable members opposite have a real problem doing away with that system. Ultimately it will do away with them. I am sure that will happen in the not-too-distant future anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this new approach has worked in many circumstances. We saw it work recently at Shepparton; once again an example of how an enterprise could be saved by doing away with the old system and the sort of work practices that had crept in over the years. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about abuse. If we really want to talk about abuse, then let us look at how unions have abused the power and privilege that they have enjoyed. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie mentioned Robe River. I will talk about Robe River for a moment. Fortunately, that company finally ended up with someone there running the show who decided that enough was enough. Some of the rorts that existed there, and which had been brought in plainly through union abuse of power, were quite incredible. They included having a chef to bring both hot and cold meals to the drivers of company trains so that they had a choice. What about the `wattle' bags they had there, so named not because of their distinctive yellow colour but because of employees asking `What'll I take home tonight?'. A moment ago I was talking about SPC. In that particular case, the workers enjoyed a shiny allowance which was apparently compensation paid to the fork-lift drivers for the glare from the fruit cans. That is the type of abuse that had crept in. And they wondered why they could not survive!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Darling Harbour project ultimately destroyed the New South Wales Government. I notice that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) is not with us tonight, but he would know all about that. The unionists on the Darling Harbour project ended up getting a Chinese meal allowance because they were working close to the restaurants of Chinatown and the wafting aromas from those establishments apparently strained their delicate culinary disposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could go on about the abuse of power that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was talking about. This country has been subjected to the abuse of trade union power for years. It has ultimately almost brought this country unstuck. I believe that now that position is entirely indefensible. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie continues to live in those past glorious days, as members of the Labor Party see them, when those union abuses could continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could talk about the Builders Labourers Federation. The history of that particular union is a catalogue of abuse of power and union thuggery almost beyond belief. We could talk about the painters and dockers and what a great institution they were members of. We could read the catalogues of the Cooke inquiry in Queensland which Mr Goss, when elected, could not close down quickly enough because of the great embarrassment that it was to him with revelations of unbelievable abuse of privilege and abuse of power by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we heard from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as we usually do, an outstanding explanation of the Opposition's very rational, modern and progressive approach to industrial relations. We on this side of the House see industrial relations, along with taxation, as being one of the key areas for reform. Members of the Government are aware that we intend to radically reform the taxation system. However, in tandem with that, we see the reform of the industrial relations system as being absolutely fundamental if Australia is to become prosperous again. Over the last seven, eight or nine years Australia has ceased to be prosperous. One of the reasons for that is the almost manic adherence of the Government to an outmoded, discredited and what has now turned out to be an unworkable system of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One outstanding feature of industrial relations in the last 10 years has been the fall off in trade union membership. The latest ABS figures show that only 41 per cent of the overall work force in 1990 were union members. Only 31 per cent in the private sector were union members. Tonight we are talking particularly about trade unionism in the public sector, where a much higher percentage of employees&mdash;68 per cent&mdash;are members of trade unions. The reason for that, as the honourable member for Bennelong clearly pointed out, was the compulsory element of trade unionism that still exists within the public sector. Compulsory trade unionism in itself is a vestige of the past. Unions have been significantly protected and they have, of course, taken advantage of that protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have identified, in the amendment that we have moved tonight, some of the most objectionable aspects of trade unionism as we see it today. As I said, the first is compulsory union membership. I must say that I have never really heard a reasoned, logical debate which would convince the average person that there is some real rationale for enforcing membership of anything on anybody in our society. It seems to me that to enforce membership of a trade union on people would deny their most fundamental right, and that is the right in our society to associate or, conversely, the right not to associate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hear some reason why people should be forced to join unions, whether they be public service unions or private sector unions. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, we hear members of the Government saying that there is no such thing as compulsory unionism in Australia. We are challenged by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to go out to the work place and see what is happening. When we do, what do we find?  We find a closed shop&mdash;effectively, compulsory trade unionism. That is one of the reasons why productivity levels have fallen so deplorably low by world standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second objectionable aspect of the current system, particularly within the Public Service&mdash;the honourable member for Bennelong alluded to some particular examples&mdash;was the preference for employment clauses; in other words, it effectively means that unless you are a member of the union, you are not likely to get a job. The third plank that we object to is the automatic deduction of union dues. We intend to reverse each of those elements. We regard them all as being counterproductive and, ultimately, we do not believe that they are in the best interests of the workers or the management, or indeed Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want to put down public servants in general because I am one of those who believes that a vibrant, efficient and effective public service is important in any society. I think there are many public servants who take great pride in their work; that they are well motivated and do their jobs well. But I do not think that anyone could argue with the proposition that underemployment is fairly rife within some parts of the Public Service. However, I do not see any reason why we should not have an effective and efficient public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition policies in general and the policies that we are talking about tonight, which are the changes that we are foreshadowing in our particular amendment, have special implications for the Public Service. They will allow the sort of flexibility that should restore the Public Service to the level of effectiveness and efficiency that it ought to have. In doing that, those who are public servants hopefully might be able to stand with some pride in that they are public servants or civil servants and that they are, in fact, making a contribution to society in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">OECD research has shown that, for public utilities, labour productivity in Australia has been less than half of that of our major trading partners. I believe that greater efficiency and productivity is a worthwhile goal. As I said before, I am concerned that the maintenance of the present system and, particularly, the high presence of trade unionism still within the Public Service is really all about power and influence and, particularly, the power and influence of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I observe in passing that the ACTU is patronised to a very great extent by this Hawke Government. There is a plethora of ACTU representation on government boards and advisory committees. I have lists of them here and I would not even be able to start to read them out. But for all on these boards, of course, there are payments for sitting fees and for travelling allowances. I think it is important to put on the record that the since the Hawke Government came to office, it has actually given the ACTU taxpayer-funded grants totalling more than $25m. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

One reason is that I have a continuing interest in both the industrial relations area and, of course, some of the proposals that come up in this Bill, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. I primarily entered the debate because of the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) when he talked about a company in his own electorate, namely, Robe River Mining Co. He made some interesting remarks which I think require a bit of further comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robe River, of course, is driving the trade union bureaucrats of Australia crazy for the simple reason that it keeps achieving. It is interesting to note the claims of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the CRA is somehow more productive, but it is not. I think they were the words that he used. He said that it was more productive but that it had an over-burden problem. By over-burden, I do not whether he means that it still has compulsory trade unionism or whether it has some dirt on top of its iron ore. But it could be a bit of both. I quote the simple facts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has Robe River Mining accomplished? It has lifted its loading rates from 2,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1986 to 5,000 tonnes per hour in mid-1991. The frequency rates for all injuries have dropped from 433 to 268 in the same period. In 1986-87 there were 63 lost time injuries and in 1990-91 there were 12. Ships residence port time has dropped from 173 hours prior to 1986 hours to an average of 74 hours today. Tonnage output per employee for the years ending March 1985, 1986 and 1987 was approximately 10,000. This has risen to a staggering 31,000 tonnes per man, per year at March 1991.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Robe River Mining has achieved a 400 per cent increase in productivity. This has been achieved by workplace reform.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an interesting point that it is not long ago that Dr Lawrence, the Premier of Western Australia, congratulated Robe River because it won the commodities award in this year's Australian export awards. That is what others saw of it. A lot of things have to be understood about Robe River. The first is that, unlike some of the other bigger operators, it operates principally in the spot market. The only reason it survives is by being super efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie also painted this picture of a management that did not really care what it paid and did not really care what sorts of deals it did with the union bureaucracy. It only had a short term mine and it did not really matter. We know that all those deals were done, but I do not think that they were done by policy of the board of directors. They were done by the then manager who now has quite a bit of notoriety in Western Australia. His name is Wyvern Rees, better known as Ollie Rees. Ollie Rees, when he got the sack at Robe River, of course was rewarded by Brian Burke, the then Premier of Western Australia, when he got the sack at Robe River, for his great services to the trade union movement in Robe River. However, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has just pointed out that they got enough food for the family every time they took a train a couple of hundred miles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rees was rewarded with the general managership of the State Government Insurance Commission. Rees is the bloke who threw all the Western Australian taxpayers' money around. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie wants to suggest that, while he was there, there was some broad company policy. Rees was a union plant. I do not know what his long term background is with the Labor movement, but Charles Copeland and others recognised the disastrous performance of the company he managed, due principally to the most stupid of arrangements. We had more people trying to get in a crane than could fit in it. There could not be one person in there operating the levers, there had to be two. There was no room for them, but that did not matter because they both got paid. People refused to be driven along roads because there was a little bit of dust on them or something. They then refused again when a water truck was put on those roads because, of course, they then were too wet. It is absolute union thuggery organised by trade union bureaucrats who have an entirely different agenda on the welfare of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the other point I want to make. These disputes have been going on at Robe River for quite some time. The only phone calls that I have ever received from Robe River&mdash;and there were a number&mdash;were from workers ringing me up because we had some passing acquaintance in the north-west during my time up there. They were saying, `Wilson, for goodness' sake, tell those stupid politicians to get off our backs. We do not want their help. What is happening up here is great. It is giving us some pride in our job. We do not like the thugs who have gone into this place, are standing over us, threatening us and wanting to knock us around if we vote other than according to their recommendations. We rather like the new jobs that we have. We are better paid'. But above all came this common thread, `We have a bit of pride. We are now proud of what we are doing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is trade union bureaucracy going to wake up to what is best for the workers? Of course, the amendment proposed by the Opposition talks about some of this. It talks about compulsory unionism. The best thing about making unionism voluntary is that the trade union bureaucrat&mdash;of course, these benches are full of them&mdash;will not have a career path now. A union bureaucrat starts off in university and does not go out and do a bit of hard work up at Robe River to find out what workers want. There is no way that person is going to get that sort of dirt under his fingernails. He goes straight to the union bureaucracy. There is a divided career path then. If he is really smart, he can become a Bill Kelty or, of course, he can be like the other fellow who is a bit slow and has joined the banking industry. I will think of his name. He has joined Westpac Banking Corporation. He has himself a nice little career. He got himself well-known and they have plucked him in. Or he could become a member of parliament with the hope, of course, of becoming Prime Minister. These are well-defined career paths. No wonder honourable members opposite do not want to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, with voluntary unionism, membership is got on performance. Those opposite should not worry;  people would join. I am a member of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. It does not send the heavies out to collect my dues. It does not get it from my wool cheque. It sends me an account and I pay it. I will tell the House why I pay it. It is because I think it gives me good service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what sort of service do people expect to get when they have to join a union?  They get nothing. That is what the workers are getting fed up with. Metway in Queensland is fighting to the death the staff association and the members who work there, trying to fend off the loving embrace of the traditional trade union bureaucracy. The company does not want it. But, of course, the present Government in Queensland does not want to worry about the company's views. The Government knows where its bread is buttered. It knows that 64 per cent of the preselection vote in Queensland, as in every other State, resides with the trade union bureaucracy. When the trade union bureaucracy says, `Jump', the Government says, `How high?'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the Government something about the trade union bureaucrats. In a free situation, with some genuine negotiation, it could be argued that the work force has more need for the services of a union than in the present centralised system. But workers will have to be convinced about it. They will have to know that they are getting good service. I think that is excellent. That is in the interests of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to Robe River for a moment. Some outrageous things have happened. The last thing that Robe River did, which has infuriated the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), is that it actually took a business decision. It decided that it was fed up with employing its own seamen on its own tugs. I will tell the House why it was fed up. Those seamen on those tugs have roughly the same industrial award as an Australian seaman on a ship sailing around the world. I made some points here the other day. I think that is a stupid arrangement, too, but we probably need to change some of the aspects of shipping so that people can take their families to sea. There is some argument about seamen being absent from their families for long periods and therefore having similar periods at home. But that is very costly and makes us uncompetitive with the rest of the world. I remind the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that it removes one of the greatest and simplest forms of value adding for Australia&mdash;shipping the products, be they primary or secondary, from this country. We are an island nation but we have no shipping industry because we have these literally bloody-minded trade union bureaucrats who until recently demanded that a butcher be on a ship on which all meals were pre-prepared before the ship left port and which were reheated in a microwave oven. I have been told about it by blokes whom I have sat next to in first-class seats on aeroplanes&mdash;who have been going off to operate their couple of cray boats in the six weeks in which they were supposed to be catching up with their relationships with Mum. That is silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that a tug sits at Cape Lambert, which is the port servicing Robe River, and goes out five or six miles to shepherd in a tanker or bulk ore carrier and then ties up again. Those blokes are living within cooee of Mum. Why should they have the one-on, one-off arrangement and all those things?  Robe River got fed up with this and made a sensible decision. It advertised throughout Australia for bids from people to provide a contracted service. That is surely the right of any business in Australia. We are not yet a totalitarian state, although when one goes to open a bank account one might wonder. But the reality is that, when Robe River did that, it got an application from a company which is saving it $1.6m in its first year of operation and $0.6m per annum after that&mdash;and doing it at a profit. I understand that the company is doing it at a profit because it is a small business organisation, owning, operating and servicing the tug itself. What is wrong with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a nation of small businessmen. The Government has a Minister for small business. But one is not supposed to have a small business in the tug business because that is a very big preserve of the trade union bureaucracy. That was the crime committed by Robe River and which caused the Western Australian Parliament, under Carmen Lawrence&mdash;notwithstanding that she bothered to put out a press release congratulating Robe River for its export performance&mdash;to pass a motion condemning Robe River. Robe River gave its work force on the existing tugs six months notice&mdash;and no doubt there was some other form of settlement. Senator Cook and members of the State Parliament have gone on about it. Larry Graham, the member for Pilbara, actually wrote to the manager of Robe River to give him the resolution of the Western Australian Parliament and went on to say in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our democratic society, the Parliament is the manifestation of the will of the people, and in this case clearly the Parliament has condemned the actions of your companies.</PARA>
<PARA>It was trying to save some money for its shareholders by employing a small businessman because the trade union bureaucracy would not let its day workers work at reasonable rates. That was supposed to be somehow anti-democratic. It sure is if you are a trade union bureaucrat because it might mean your job one day. What is the greatest anathema to trade union bureaucrats?  It is workers negotiating with the boss, making their own arrangements, because, if enough of them did that, the simple fact is that the trade union bureaucrats would not be needed. For goodness sake, fancy losing all those opportunities to be Prime Minister!  That is outrageous, is it not?  It is doubly outrageous when one goes into the small business premises in Australia and, as I have and I guess most members have from time to time, one goes looking for the boss. </PARA>

He is probably running around in a pair of steel-capped boots, black shorts and blue singlet. He does not look any different from the other fellows. He sits down at morning tea with them and they have a good chat about their business. They happen to like the boss and to be grateful that, through his bit of energy&mdash;and probably through mortgaging his family home&mdash;he has created a job for them. There are 760,000 similar operations. Those workers do not need Bill Kelty. They are fed up with this Government's award structures because of their complexity. They would much prefer to have simple, flat, hourly rates provided they are at a reasonable level. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than anything, I support what my Party is doing because it will give a few breaks to workers who choose something different.

But we are just giving them also the right to say, `No, thanks;  I am quite happy to represent myself because, from the examples that I see around me at Power Brewing, Lincoln Electric, Metway and thousands of other small businesses where it does not pay you fellows to come around and heavy the trade union fees out of a couple of workers, the people seem to be doing pretty well, thank you very much.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often talk about transport in this place. Let Government members find for me a long haulage driver who wants the award. He wants trip money. He wants it to be generous, and he will always argue for a bit more, but he wants something he can understand. More importantly in this day and age, knowing how voracious the Government is in taking its share, he wants to know how much he is going to get in his hand. Into the bargain, he is fed up with the tax scales and their complexity. Let Government members grab one of those fellows as I have time and again&mdash;I bet those opposite who are trade union bureaucrats never have&mdash;and ask him, `Would you like to own this truck?'. Every time he will say, `Yes'. I am still guarantor for a couple of truckies whom I set up in business. I gave them a break. They did not want the Government's protection so that they worked only a 30-hour week. They wanted to own a truck and to work a lot more than that, and to work hard for the extra money they could make for themselves and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opportunities are what Australians grasp at when they can get out of the web of the trade union bureaucracy. That is why, when we give people the choice, we will find out how good trade unions are, because the good ones will keep members and give proper services. If they do not, they will die. That seems a good ending for those who do not. At the moment they all do not, and they live in some prosperity. It is interesting to find the addresses of some of those senior trade union bureaucrats today. We do not find them in the working class suburbs. Consult the electoral roll. There would not be too many in the electorate of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). They all want to live up and to live it up.

I say to those opposite here and now that the workers of Port Kembla will not accept that, and I support them. I support them wholeheartedly. I joined the picket line, and I will join it again on Friday. The only thing that the Opposition understands about industrial relations is a threat to put troops on the waterfront. It says this to the workers at Port Kembla and at other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strike at Port Kembla is about contract workers. The honourable member for O'Connor reacted very strongly when I interjected about the wage rates for contract work. Contract labour is about reducing working conditions that workers in Australia, with their unions, have fought for and achieved over many, many years, and it is about reducing their hourly rates. Quite frankly, the workers I am proud to represent are not going to tolerate that. They are not going to see eroded the conditions that they have worked for over many years. They are not going to see wages go down. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor and other Opposition members waxed lyrical about voluntary unionism. That is fine; it is great to stand up here and talk about the choice of the workers and whether they are going to join a union or not. The question I would like to ask is this: if there is to be all this freedom in allowing people to decide whether to join a trade union or not, will there be the same freedom of choice in deciding whether or not to get the benefits that the unions negotiate and fight for? Will those people who are not going to join unions refuse the benefits that the unions get? Of course not. They want the best of both worlds. They want the benefits achieved through unionism, but they do not want to be a member of a union. They cannot have it both ways. If people are going to take the benefits that the unions get through fighting and struggling, it is up to them to join a union. </PARA>

In many of the cleaning jobs going on it will be the lowest common denominator. It could well be $2 an hour. The honourable member for O'Connor said that many people say they do not need unions. Like many members of Parliament, I often have people come to me when they have been thrown out of a job and there is some dispute about their severance pay or their wages. I could quote numerous examples. The first thing I ask these people is, `Have you seen your union?'. Many of them say, `I am not in a union'. It is very difficult then for me to go in and do battle for them to get their entitlements. Most of the people who come to me and who have not been unionists most certainly join a union after that.

I do not want to get the correct rate of pay. I do not want the conditions. I do not want the safety requirements on the job. I do not want any of these conditions'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to rise tonight to enter into this most significant debate. Like other honourable members before me, I will concentrate on the industrial relations portion of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. The contribution that we have just heard was undoubtedly one of the most ill-informed and unstructured approaches to this debate that I have heard in many a long year. I inform the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that I know a wee bit about the steel industry. I spent 7 1/2 years in a steel mill, the first 4 1/2 on the floor of a blast furnace&mdash;I have been there, done that&mdash;and I know all about collective bargaining. I grew up with collective bargaining. Is this not what the Industrial Relations Commission last week in its newest national wage case, in response to the April national wage case&mdash;which was a Clayton's wage case&mdash;has given Australia? I support the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that any action by the Government, any action by the Industrial Relations Commission which opens up our constrained and constricted system, is to be applauded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I am pleased that the Industrial Relations Commission has said, `Let us have a bit more action in section 115, and perhaps in the odd case we will even look at section 112 of the Industrial Relations Act'. In April the Commission said that Australia was not mature enough for enterprise bargaining. In October it said, `Maybe you are and maybe you aren't; you can have it', but its description of enterprise bargaining, the Government's description of enterprise bargaining, the Labor Party's description of enterprise bargaining, bears no relationship to my description or that of the Liberal Party or the National Party&mdash;the coalition. Enterprise bargaining to me means a free discussion between management and the people who work in the workplace about how they are going to share the profits of the workplace or business, those profits being what is left after money has been spent on material cost inputs and on government charges&mdash;which are excessive in this country&mdash;on regulations, on taxation, on overheads and on selling expenses. Finally, we get around to the cost of people&mdash;people being a major cost input in most businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House say that those people ought to have the right to negotiate freely the kinds of benefits that they are going to receive out of what is left. The problem we have at the moment is that frequently there is nothing left and, increasingly frequently in this recession that we `had to have', more and more businesses are disappearing because of the total inflexibility of the system. The newest national wage case will not decrease that inflexibility because it says, de facto, `Award wages are the minimum, award conditions are the minimum, award hours of work are the minimum; you can pay more if you can do a deal with your work force and if you get the union to agree'&mdash;not your work force&mdash;`that it is okay, you can do a deal'. Terrific. That is very positive stuff. The problem is that it does not put into the equation the local people at the local plant, at the local workface, where it really happens. They are the ones who are concerned, they are the ones who want to keep their jobs. In these hard times they may have to negotiate down a bit. Next year, when times are better&mdash;if they get better next year, and that is under question&mdash;the work force gets a better slice of the cake. That is positive. Perhaps they could keep their jobs; perhaps more Australian businesses would not be going bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear an awful lot of rhetoric from the Australian Labor Party when it comes to industrial relations. We do not hear much rhetoric from this side of the House. We talk about real people; that is, working men and women, and that is mostly everybody out there. There are very few so-called capitalists left in this world. If we look at the composition of those who own the business enterprises in this country, we find that over 90 per cent of the business enterprises are owned by small people in small business with very few employees, who do good things for this country, and we have to learn how to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary union membership is something we are talking about in the amendment to this Bill; not union bashing, but truly the opportunity to belong or not to belong. I have been an employer for a long time; I have also been a real worker. As an employer I have been required time and time again, because of this thing called the `closed shop', to tell new and intending employees, `If you want to work for my company you have to buy a union ticket, mate, before we will put you on the payroll'. If he says, `I don't want to belong to the union', I say, `That is tough. If you want to work for this company you buy a ticket because the Government of Victoria says that you will build no buildings in Victoria with any people who do not belong to not only a union but the right union'. Increasingly, that right union must have a minimum of 10,000 members. That is wonderful. In its heyday my company employed 45 people. We would love to have an enterprise union because my people do not like the constraints of the central system, they do not like the award conditions. They would like to work longer and smarter. They would like to get rid of closing down an industry for 12 rostered days off a year. What an absolute nonsense that is. It destroys any chance of productivity to close an industry down for 12 days a year so that the union bureaucracy bosses can make sure everybody gets their RDO and nobody is cheating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) really went over the top when he talked about the power of the winder drivers. He was talking about the innate power inherent in the trade union system as practised in this country through centralised control, because we give the unions that control over the system. We give the unions control over the system because we allow compulsory union membership, we allow the closed shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some day my private member's Bill will be passed and we will have true voluntary union membership. Some day it will happen. I do not know whether it is going to be in 1991&mdash;there is still time for an election, is there not?&mdash;or in 1992. We on this side of the House are not sure who we will be facing. Will it be the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), or the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)? It looks like he is in for a shot shortly, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get back to industrial relations. Voluntary union membership is not about union bashing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give an example of an enterprise union that I know of in the United States. Over some 30 years it accumulated several hundred members. It developed such inefficient work practices, and shop stewards in their individual areas developed so much control, that the place became an absolute nightmare of inefficiency. Finally, after 30 years, that enterprise union reached a boiling point of frustration and its membership went on strike. The world was going to come to an end. Seven days later they went back to work. In the process of going back to work they made a decision to join a national union. When they did, life changed immediately. Now, instead of 37 single job classifications, there are five. Now, instead of lines painted on the floor past which people do not walk, everybody does what they are capable of doing and what their training will enable them to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a bloke on the lathe rings up the AF of L and says, `Mr National Union Organiser, would you please come and help me because the boss is making me sweep the floor', the national union tells him to get lost because it has more important things to do. It says, `Go back to work and do the job and perhaps the company might make a profit and you can earn more money next year'. That is an instance in which an enterprise union has not served the company or its membership well and the national union is doing a better job. I make the important point that unions are there to serve their membership. It is long past time they did. All too frequently in this country they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred to the winder drivers and how much power they had, and whether it was not time that we devolved a bit of it. Everybody has talked about Robe River. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that Hamersley-CRA is more productive than Robe River. I dispute that. They are different operations; they process different ore and they have different clients. But it is clear that in the last four years, from March of 1987 until March of 1991, output per employee at Robe River increased by 320 per cent&mdash;that is, 320 per cent in 48 calendar months. That has to be an Australian record. If we could do half as well with half the major enterprises in this country, we would not be worried about our balance of payments; we would have the problem solved. We would not be worried about protectionism and we would not be worried about interest rates; we would be in the best shape that anyone could imagine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about the Liberal road leading to industrial chaos. From my viewpoint, we have industrial chaos in this country now, and we have had it for the entire time that I have had the privilege of living in this great nation. We have the most archaic, antiquated, misdirected industrial relations system in the world. It makes absolutely no sense. I am certain that our forefathers who devised that system were convinced that what they had&mdash;the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and its Act, which was at the forefront of industrial relations at the time&mdash;was the best thing since sliced bread. The only problem is that time marched on and we did not. Our system did not march on; all it has done is become more and more centralised, to the point at which we are so constrained that we do not allow our people on the shop floor to earn more money, we do not allow them to work the hours they would like to work and we do not allow them to communicate with their managements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 17 October 1991 in the Senate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) made a speech on reforming the industrial relations system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1979 an average of 3.8 per cent of full time employees were absent from work because of illness, accident or absenteeism. In 1989 the figure remained relatively steady at 3.4 per cent of full time employees. This reflects the fact that management has yet to address fully issues such as work organisation and job satisfaction which are central to reducing absenteeism.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not just management. Talk about kick the can! We have had a kick the management can concept in this country for about the last two years. We constantly kick management because we say management is incompetent. That is why we have industrial action; that is why the workers are unhappy; that is why the industrial relations system does not work; that is why we are inefficient in this country&mdash;because management is terrible. The work force is terrific but management is terrible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system says that a boss, an owner of an enterprise, cannot sit down at the table in his own premises and negotiate wages, conditions of employment and work practices with his own people; that he has to deal through a union and he has to deal through the Industrial Relations Commission. That is nonsense. How on earth can management ever develop the skills that the Industrial Relations Commission in the April wage case decision said it did not have? The IRC said, `You are not mature enough, Australia; you are not mature enough as workers and you are not mature enough as managers to handle this thing which John Howard, the honourable member for Bennelong and shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, calls enterprise bargaining'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of enterprise bargaining is an Australian concept, not a worldwide concept. It is not a Yank concept or a German concept or an English concept; it is not French, Italian or even Iranian. This really is an Australian concept for Australian conditions. It came from this side of the House, from the Liberal and National parties from work done in 1986. I have been the greatest supporter of that work because I believe it offers us a solution to many of our problems. It offers us the opportunity to move from this massive centralised control system to something that will work in the Australian context without going quite as far as New Zealand went&mdash;that is, totally abolishing the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are times when I believe that perhaps we should just scrap it and start all over again, because we are pretty mature in this country. Yes, we need to learn something about bargaining and yes, we have to practise at it. But we will get better with practice. I am sure managements will learn, and I know the workers will learn, and I think even the unions will catch on that they have to work to keep their members. They have to provide them with some services that they find valuable. That way the unions will keep their membership, regardless of my Bill for voluntary union membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do not need to go all the way down the New Zealand track. Voluntary union membership and voluntary employment agreements will be all about the free choice of workers and management to make decisions for themselves about things which are their business only. What business is it of Bill Kelty or Martin Ferguson if the management and workers at Du Pont (Australia), fibre makers in my electorate, want to make a deal between themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty have to do with how many hours production line workers at Glaxo in my electorate work on their new production facilities? Glaxo is run by a pretty enlightened mob. It has four new lines and $40m worth of some of the highest technological production equipment in the world. Those workers work 12 hours a day, three days a week&mdash;that is a total of 36 hours&mdash;and then they go home. So the lines run for six days a week non-stop and are shut down on Sunday. That is a very enlightened approach. Because of our system it took those parties two years to negotiate the agreement. And then the unions came in and said, `No, you can't do that'. They messed the agreement up and it took another 12 months to sort it out. The unions said, `Only the greenfield part of this plant, only the four new production lines worth $40m, can run 12 hours a day'. Guess what? Nine months later, the whole blessed plant wants to work 12 hours a day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago one of my constituents, an elderly lady in receipt of a pension, withdrew $5,000 in cash from her bank account. Shortly afterwards, her home was broken into and the money was stolen. This tragic event is simply one example of the fear and the anxiety that this Government has engendered amongst the elderly folk and other recipients of social security. Since the election of this Government, there have been constant changes to the social security legislation and continued attacks on the savings of the elderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To find evidence of the Government's arrogance in this regard, one need look no further than my own electorate of Dunkley. The Department of Social Security in Frankston has recently cancelled payments to sole parents who had failed only to inform the Department of their tax file number. Not only does this raise the ugly spectre of Big Brother and a de facto Australia Card, but also it is clear that the Government is now so desperate to raise revenue that dollars are being grabbed from anywhere and everywhere. This kind of treatment directed at those who are amongst the most vulnerable in the community is nothing short of bullying and blackmail. The pampered social engineers who inhabit the Department of Social Security here in Canberra have little regard for the contribution that Australia's senior citizens have made to the development of this nation. The last few years in particular have seen a concerted attack on the elderly, especially by the bureaucracy and its supporters&mdash;the professional do-gooders who lead comfortable lives on the public payroll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why cannot the elderly people just be left alone to enjoy their retirement in peace and quiet? They have worked hard all of their lives and paid their taxes. It is bad enough to have to wait in line for so-called elective surgery, but there are over 70,000 people on the waiting lists of public hospitals, many of those persons being the elderly. Regrettably, Frankston hospital in my electorate has quite a long waiting list, which is not the hospital's fault. It is a great facility with great staff. Why are many on the waiting lists the elderly? Many elderly, to avoid these delays, are joining expensive private funds. Again, I ask: why should they? They cannot avoid the pharmaceutical bureaucracy; records must be kept for Big Brother. But why are they being pestered for tax file numbers? It is just a new rule dreamt up in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this comes on top of incomprehensible changes to roll-over provisions and superannuation. The bureaucrats whose telephone numbers are given for advice do not answer, so no advice is available. Opening a bank account was once a fairly simple and straightforward task. But, thanks to the introduction of yet more rules, intending depositors are subject to a Gestapo-style inquisition and demands of proof of identity. If the elderly try to open a bank account, it is almost impossible, as they do not in many cases have driving licences, credit cards or tax file numbers. If they do eventually open an account, their interest rate is deemed at 8 per cent, which attracts provisional tax apart from the normal tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constant introduction of more and more rules regarding aspects of people's lives, their finances and their medical problems is, to say the least, a pathetic example of this Government's real attitude to older Australians. I ask the Government: why has life become so complicated for our elderly? Take a person over 65 on a small income from superannuation, receiving $368 per fortnight pension, including $62 rent allowance and a $5 pharmacy subsidy, with no tax payable up to $9,699. To this point, it is quite complicated enough. But from here on, it becomes ridiculous. For gross income over $9,699, there is a rebate of 12.8 per cent which cuts out at $16,995. Coupled with this is a 50c tax on each dollar earned over $84. The result is a nasty trap for anyone unlucky enough to fall into this horrendously complicated web of unnecessary regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if that were not enough, to add insult to injury, a 50c reduction in pension for every dollar earned is an effective tax rate of 50 per cent. I wonder how this compares with the favoured status accorded to the Prime Minister's media mates. Their tax rate is reported to be as low as 10 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I submitted a petition to the House on behalf of 300 people justifiably concerned about the treatment of Jews in Syria. Whilst delighted to be entrusted with the task of presenting that petition, I wish now to add my voice to others protesting against the treatment of Syrian Jewry. Ironically, welcome developments in global politics have left us in danger of bypassing this fundamental issue of human rights. The new acceptability of the Assad regime in the wake of the Gulf war and subsequent Middle East peace process, coupled with the euphoria surrounding the mass emigration of Soviet refuseniks, can conceivably divert critical eyes from Syria's reprehensible internal policies. Indeed, since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the spectre of Western leaders tripping over themselves to embrace President Assad has become so familiar as to lead one to think that all pre-August 1990 grievances have been completely forgotten. In the meantime, the oppression of Syrian Jewry and other minority groups such as the Kurds continues unchecked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welcome as we should the current Middle East peace process and related thaw in Syrian-Western relations, let us not forget that little has changed in Syria. Support for the allies in the Gulf war, while commendable, had more to do with President Assad's antipathy towards his Baathist enemy, Saddam Hussein, than it did with any new world order. The people of Lebanon will testify to this. As it now stands, a cash-strapped Syria is being richly rewarded for its judicious opposition to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Economically and politically, it is also benefiting from participation in the Madrid peace negotiations. Any pay back for this new mood of conciliation in Damascus must not involve turning a blind eye to the treatment of Syrian Jews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way as lasting peace in the Middle East depends on Israel's acceptance of Palestinian rights, so it also depends on Syrian acceptance of the rights of its Jewish minority, in particular the right to emigrate. Just as aid to the Soviet Union was made conditional upon the free emigration of refuseniks and just as aid is now being used as a weapon in American attempts to halt new settlements in the occupied territories, economic assistance to Syria should be made conditional upon a relaxation of controls over the Jewish community. For as long as Jewish emigration is prevented, Syria will continue to violate article 13 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A restriction on the right to emigrate is but one of the constraints under which the Syrian Jewish community lives. Constant surveillance of the community by a special branch of the Syrian secret police, the Makhabarat, intrudes into daily life to the point where all travel over five miles requires prior approval. Virtually every activity must be reported to the Makhabarat, whilst every word uttered by the community leaders is monitored, particularly where it involves contact with foreigners. Intrusive personal dossiers are also kept on each member of the 3,800 strong community. Of greater concern is the confinement of the majority of the community to a single ghetto in Damascus, from which contact with the rest of the population is largely prohibited. In a manner reminiscent of a previous regime, the Syrian Government marks the identity cards of all Jews with the word `Mousawi', meaning member of the Mosaic faith. No other religious group is identified in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Past experience should alert Australia to the dangers of ignoring the plight of an oppressed minority group for geopolitical purposes. This is particularly so when the case in question bears a resemblance to past tragedies, the most recent of which was the betrayal of the Lebanon to Syria. As one would expect, the Syrian plans for peace in the Middle East involve Israel's surrendering all territories acquired in the 1967 war. This of course raises questions about the plight of Jewish settlers in the affected areas. On this point the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported on 1 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Syria is not demanding the departure of all Jewish settlers from the West Bank. Whilst not suggesting that all settlements would be allowed to stay, it is prepared to contemplate Jewish residents who would have free passage to and from Israel.</PARA>
<PARA>Aside from the observation that this is a minimal concession to make, Syria's treatment of its own Jewish minority hardly inspires confidence in such an undertaking. Like most people, I hope that the current Middle East peace process will bear fruit. Yet, as the Treaty of Versailles showed, in the fruits of current peace sometimes lurk the seeds of future tragedy. All issues must be dealt with in the current negotiations if we are truly to bring relief to the long suffering people of the Middle East. Let us ensure that no minority group is forgotten in the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a most extraordinary matter whereby one of my constituents, Mr Edward Rice of Bourke, has been unfairly and unjustly treated by the legal processes in this country. Mr Rice owns a cordial factory in Bourke. Over the years this has been a constant target for petty break-ins, usually by Aboriginal children. It used to be broken into frequently&mdash;about two or three times a week. However, if the culprits were caught and reported to the police, it was a waste of time because if they were under a certain age they were not charged; if they were over a certain age, even if convicted, little or nothing happened anyway. Mr Rice found that if he caught someone and reported them he would waste half a day in court. Therefore, he soon learned not to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago Mr Rice spent $6,000 building a six-foot high steel fence around his factory. That was relatively successful because it cut the break-ins down to once a month. Recently he was broken into a couple of times. The last time some cash was taken and his truck keys were pinched. He was annoyed about this because the keys were of no use to anyone and he could not conduct his business in a proper manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a few days someone told Mr Rice the names of two of the four Aboriginal children who had broken in. He tracked down one of them, an 11-year-old boy, Aaron McKellar, who admitted he was involved. He went to his house. The mother was not there at the time. The father was not there either because the parents had separated. However, he spoke to the boy's uncle, Tom McKellar, who Ted Rice thought was the boy's father. Ted Rice explained to the boy's uncle that he did not want him charged by the police and that the boy should be made aware that what he had done was wrong. Instead of letting him off scot free, he wanted to take him back to the factory to get him to clean up some of the mess that had been created. The uncle agreed to this. Mr Rice even offered the uncle the opportunity to come along too, but he declined to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rice drove the boy to the factory, gave the boy a hefty kick up the backside and set him to work. A short time later his mother arrived home and rang to see what was happening and to say that her son had not yet had breakfast. Mr Rice explained the situation to her satisfaction and went and bought the boy breakfast, which he ate. An hour or so later the boy's mother arrived to pick him up, but Mr Rice said he wanted to keep her son for another hour or so. She agreed to that and left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A policeman, having been alerted to what was going on, also arrived to check things out. Again Mr Rice explained what was happening. The policeman agreed it was a better course of action than having the boy charged. He left satisfied. I might add that while the boy was there he retrieved the stolen truck keys from up a tree on the other side of the road, though they were of no use to Mr Rice as he had got a new set cut in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After about 3 1/2 hours Mr Rice drove the boy home. He even offered to pay the boy if he would come back the next day to work. The following day the police rang Mr Rice and said that on the insistence of the Western Aboriginal Legal Service they were charging him with kidnapping and assault. Now kidnapping is a very serious charge; if convicted, one can get between 14 and 20 years gaol. Even though this was obviously a ridiculous charge, Mr Rice, a layman, was understandably terrified. He flew to Sydney, hired the best solicitor and barrister he could and largely disregarded the expense. When the case came up for hearing in Bourke last week the prosecution dropped the kidnapping charge. However, Mr Rice was found guilty of assault. He now has a criminal conviction against his name and he is on a three-year good behaviour bond. He has had to pay $2,000 to a women's refuge in lieu of a fine. On top of that he has paid out $14,300 in legal fees so far, he has paid his own travelling expenses, and he could be up for a lot more money yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have from this situation?  We have a kid who is guilty but has not been charged. We have no attempt by the police to locate the other three people involved, let alone charge them. A man who tried to do the right thing has been charged and has been worried sick for months about a ridiculous charge which has been devastating to his personal family life. He has been convicted on a criminal charge and he is out of pocket, in money and time, to the extent of nearly $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this raises a lot of questions about our legal system and about our Aboriginal legal aid system and how it operates. A travesty of justice has occurred in this case. Ted Rice is not the only loser. Bourke, a town which is enraged by what has happened, is not the only loser either. All of Australia is the loser. The sooner the Attorney-General of New South Wales, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) and all other people concerned with this decision get together to right the wrongs and to see that such a stupid decision can never be made again the better it will be for everyone. Commonsense in this instance has gone out the window, and the sooner it is regained the better. </PARA>

Twelve ships were lost, and these 12 ships were lost through structural faults. In the first four months of 1991 a further six of these ships have gone missing, with additional loss of life. All of these ships were carrying iron ore and some of them sailed from Australian ports after loading ironstone in north-west Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As ANSTO shows in its 1990-91 `Program of Research' publication, ANSTO's programs are conducted within the scope of 35 projects. Of these, 13 do not depend in any way on the presence of or access to the MOATA or HIFAR reactors, as shown in the following table:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The closure of HIFAR would have a major adverse effect on the 22 projects identified in (1) above as depending on access to a reactor. Closure would have similar serious effects on research carried out by Australian universities and industry using HIFAR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The estimate was only notional and not based on any specific replacement device for HIFAR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) One of the justifications for HIFAR is the production of technetium 99m for medical purposes on a cost-effective and reliable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Molybdenum 99 is a precursor for technetium 99m&mdash;that is, technetium 99m is created through the radioactive decay of molybdenum 99. Molybdenum 99 itself is not suitable, and is not used, as a radioactive tracer for medical applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Molybdenum 99 is imported at considerable extra cost on occasions when HIFAR is shut down for extended maintenance. The excess cost of importing finished radioisotope products to replace those produced in HIFAR would be in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million each year and up to 90 per cent of this would be for products incorporating molybdenum/technetium isotopes. Importation of medical radioisotopes would lead to uncertainties in supply and erratic delivery of patient care throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The absence of a reactor at ANSTO is not seen to be a situation that could occur on a short unanticipated timescale. A contingency plan for the absence of a reactor at ANSTO is therefore unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The ANSTO Act requires that `In undertaking its functions the Organisation shall have regard to the national science and energy policy objectives of the Commonwealth Government.' It is inevitable therefore that the objectives of a number of ANSTO programs will have a close relationship with programs of other public research bodies subject to the same Government policy objectives. Examples are ANSTO programs in advanced materials, environmental science and biomedicine and health where the objectives are to contribute towards Australia's industrial innovation, and environmental and health management. A high level of cooperation ensures that these ANSTO programs complement those of other research bodies as indicated in (9) below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The unique multidisciplinary skills and facilities of ANSTO have always been made available to the wider Australian research community through a well developed network of communication and cooperation. For instance AINSE, the Australian Institute for Nuclear Science and Engineering, was established by ANSTO (then the AAEC) in 1958 specifically for the purpose of coordinating and facilitating access to ANSTO's expertise and national facilities for scientists from Australian universities and similar organisations. Membership of AINSE now stands at 21 universities plus CSIRO in addition to ANSTO itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO liaises closely with other government and university research bodies as well as industry. Such liaison is facilitated through regular meetings of a series of Program Advisory Committees established in each ANSTO research program area which contain representatives from industry, universities, medical bodies, and relevant State and Commonwealth Government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO also has bilateral arrangements with several universities and teaching hospitals, eg the National Medical Cyclotron (NMC) located at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, which is currently being commissioned, and the Australian Centre for Advanced Risk and Reliability Engineering (ACARRE) with the University of Sydney. Additional networks are under discussion in the context of the Government's new Cooperative Research Centre proposals which will further enhance this communication and cooperation. ANSTO is already party to one of these CRCs, the Centre for Waste Management and Pollution Control, in cooperation with the Universities of NSW and Western Sydney, the CSIRO Division of Water Resources, BHP Co Ltd, ICI Australia Ltd, Australian Defence Industries, Brambles Australia/Cleanaway, IBM Australia Ltd, Sydney Water Board, NSW Public Works Department, NSW Department of Water Resources and the NSW Waste Management Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) ANSTO's commercial activities are driven by objectives and strategies contained in ANSTO's Strategic Plan, including the objective of ensuring that ANSTO's applied research, commercial and training activities in nuclear science and associated technologies contribute to Australia's industrial innovation, and environmental and health management.

Even so, development and improvement of glass as a waste form is still proceeding. Thus the time taken so far for Synroc development (1979-1991), with comparatively low expenditures, is far from excessive.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There are no clear-cut standards by which the Department judges whether serving ambassadors should be relieved of their duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serving ambassadors could be relieved of their duties if they failed to perform their duties with the professionalism, integrity or efficiency required of their position. An ambassador could also be relieved of his or her duties where circumstances were such that the ambassador was not able to meet the operational requirements of the Department at the post. This might occur where the ambassador was ill or was required to be absent from the post for a protracted period. In any of the above cases, it would be the circumstances of the particular case, and not any set criteria which would determine whether the removal of the ambassador was the appropriate course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there are no formal criteria covering the `standing aside' of ambassadors.

The decision to terminate the appointment in this case was not in any way intended to prejudge the outcome of the inquiry but was based solely on the Government's responsibility to ensure that its overseas missions can perform their tasks effectively.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The general practice of each of the three research agencies is to perform contract research on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In operating on a commercial basis the research agencies generally include the full costs of overheads, a profit margin and other additional costs when making arrangements for contracted research. When the contracted research clearly falls within the existing research strategy of the agency and there will be benefit to the agency's own programs in performing the contracted research, a decision may be made within the agency to forgo the profit margin and/or cover some of the overheads itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to performing contracted research, the research agencies may enter into collaborative research and development agreements directed towards generating defined products or processes, where both the contributions to the research and the benefits from it are shared on an agreed basis between the agency and a sponsor.

The granting bodies provide an opportunity for the research agencies to acquire additional research funding in areas relevant to the research agencies' mission and areas of expertise.

It is possible for a request to be made for the return of a person in the absence of a treaty, although whether this would be granted is a matter for the law and practice of the country concerned and its decision in a particular case. A request without a treaty basis normally requires a reciprocity undertaking; that is, that the requesting State would extradite to the requested State in like circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is no negotiated arrangement, and the special arrangements between Commonwealth countries do not apply, extradition is considered on a country by country basis. Where a request by Australia is granted by a country on the assumption of reciprocity, a serious risk of misunderstanding arises. This is because of the need for Australia, if subsequently asked to extradite, to apply the Extradition Act (which requires the making of Regulations) and the consequent application of statutory bars to extradition from Australia. In view of possible differences in legal systems and the desirability of exchanging information on conditions and limitations on extradition, my decision was that it was preferable to seek to establish a treaty basis for extradition with Jordan rather than proceed with an ad hoc request. Australia has informed the Jordanian Government that Australia would be happy to enter into negotiations on an extradition treaty with Jordan.</PARA>
