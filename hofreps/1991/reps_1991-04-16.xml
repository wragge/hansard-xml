<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, before you call on Question Time, I ask you a question in relation to the conduct of Question Time. During Question Time yesterday, you indicated that you had an undertaking from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that there would be at least 14 questions asked each day, and that, if necessary, Question Time would go on longer if Ministers gave long answers to questions. You will recall that yesterday only eight questions were asked and answered. Have you spoken with the Leader of the House with a view to having additional questions today?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Now that the Prime Minister has had 24 hours to refresh his memory, I repeat my question which I asked twice yesterday: did he meet privately with Laurie Connell before the infamous lunch on 15 June 1987? Did he discuss the Government's attitude to gold tax at that meeting, or at the lunch?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not finished the answer yet. Wait and see. Opposition members will get no comfort from this answer whatsoever. Indeed, they will need to examine their own position very closely. I repeat: my program shows that no private meeting was arranged with Mr Connell on 15 June, and no such private meeting with Mr Connell occurred. I was properly concerned yesterday to say to the House that it was possible that Mr Connell was the first to arrive. If that was the case, it did not constitute-and it was not intended to constitute-a private meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are five fundamentally important points that need to be made on the issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, as the honourable member for Bennelong said this morning, I-and, for that matter, anyone else-should not be expected to remember matters such as whether Mr Connell was the first to arrive. Secondly, and very importantly, as the honourable member for Bennelong said, such questions and whether there was in fact a lunch and discussion about party politics are irrelevant. This morning, the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's when there's a link. It is when you change policy or you give a fresh commitment in consequence or in expectation of a particular donation, and certainly when the circumstances suggest a degree of secrecy and covertness about it, that you have a problem . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat what the honourable member said--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members may have heard it, but they do not like it, and that is why I am repeating it. The honourable member said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It's when you change policy or give a fresh commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, as you and all honourable members of this House will be aware, I have consistently asserted, and I do so again, that there was no change of policy and no fresh commitment made at the luncheon.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Mr Connell's own evidence under cross-examination absolutely confirms my assertion. This is what Mr Connell said, and I ask all honourable members, particularly those opposite who have asked questions, to listen. Mr Connell said:</PARA>
<PARA>What I was wanting was some confirmation of the Prime Minister's view in respect of the introduction of a gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, by definition, it is only possible to confirm something which is already understood.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Carlton" NAMEID="DF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very hollow laugh this time, my friend. I shall repeat the words of Mr Connell. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What I was wanting was some confirmation of the Prime Minister's view in respect of the introduction of the gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, by definition, it is only possible to confirm something which is already understood. So Mr Connell, on his own statement, was not seeking-if I can use the language of the honourable member for Bennelong-a change of policy or an embellishment of policy; he was just seeking a confirmation. He obviously understood the policy as I had announced it as recently as that very morning on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio. That total series of allegations and fabrications by the Opposition on this matter is destroyed by the very evidence of Mr Connell himself under cross-examination. In precisely the same way, may I say, by the criterion set this morning by the honourable member for Bennelong do these allegations and these fabrications fall entirely to the ground.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, while this point, in terms of what I have said earlier about there being no private meeting, has no basic relevance, it is interesting to note that in Mr Connell's own evidence the gold tax question was not the subject of conversation at some private meeting that he alleges took place. Let me quote from the transcript of his cross-examination. After he said that he had no recall about whether the matter had been discussed, this question was then put to him specifically:</PARA>
<PARA>So you positively say that during the course of the luncheon itself, as distinct from this private meeting that you speak of, this gold tax was the subject of conversation at the lunch?</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat it. In answer to the previous question, Mr Connell said that he could not recall whether there had been any discussion of it at what he alleges was a private meeting. He could not recall whether there was any discussion of the matter there. But he is specifically nailed. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>So you positively say that during the course of the luncheon itself, as distinct from this private meeting you speak of, the gold tax was the subject of conversation at the lunch?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Connell answered yes. It is all perfectly clear; but let me say this finally: the standards of the Opposition in this whole matter are best illustrated by the fact that yesterday in this House the Leader of the National Party, when referring to the gold tax issue, quoted the transcript of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Prime Minister have anything to say in the question?</PARA>
<PARA>MR CONNELL: Yes I believe he did.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it did not suit the purposes of the Leader of the National Party to go on and to quote, as he could have, what followed in the transcript. I have already referred to it, but let me go to it. The Leader of the National Party had the transcript in his hands, and he did not quote it. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, when you say `I believe he did', are you saying you have a specific recollection of this occasion or not?</PARA>
<PARA>MR CONNELL: Yes. I am saying that he was able to confirm the view that there would not be a gold tax introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Leader of the National Party had in his hands the very words out of the mouth of Mr Connell which destroyed the basis of the allegations and the innuendo that he was putting to me.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole basis of the Opposition's proposition has been, from the time it started on this miserable affair, to talk about seeking some private commitment, some private undertaking. It had the evidence in its own hands-him saying, `Yes, I am saying that he was able to confirm the view that there would not be a gold tax introduced'. Out of their own mouths and by their own actions are revealed the standards, the miserable, low nature of members of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be a high requirement of public policy that the tax system be both efficient and equitable, and that has been the policy which this Government has pursued. As the Prime Minister has said, no interest group has ever been able to buy the favours of this Government in terms of tax. By knocking out capital gains against all the vested interests-the fringe benefits tax, the abolition of entertainment as a deduction, foreign source income; all of these various issues-it is obvious that the Government has followed an entirely fearless approach to tax reform which, again, is in corroboration with what the Prime Minister said earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, in the debate, I referred to a number of articles particularly in the West Australian where Western Australian members of Parliament on the Opposition side believe that they have a duty to diminish the revenue of the Commonwealth by protecting certain sectors of commerce from legitimate taxation. I referred particularly to the utterances by the honourable member for Pearce, the former Senator Chaney. In doing so, I referred to Senator Chaney's arrangements for Mr Howard to visit Mr Bond. He shook his head as though he had not made arrangements and intimated in his body language to the House that it was not right when, in fact, Mr Howard confirmed it after Question Time. Then Mr Howard said-I will come back to Senator Chaney--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the end of Question Time the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I cannot honestly recall everything that took place in the discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the discussion with Mr Bond. Today, on the Howard Sattler program in Perth, the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot give you a verbatim account of every minute detail of the conversation that you could have a conversation four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It may. I think that is what happened. I mean, once again, don't hold me to that. I mean, crikey, I can't be expected to remember who said what first.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition got up today and, in a snide way, asked the Prime Minister whether he had had time to refresh his memory. What the honourable member for Bennelong did was dump on the whole charge by the Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister should have remembered all the details of a lunch four years ago when the honourable member for Bennelong quite honestly said to the House, `I can't remember and I should not be required to remember'. In other words, the honourable member for Bennelong has dumped on the Opposition strategy, the principal thing being, firstly, that the Prime Minister should have remembered everything that was said at lunch and, secondly, there is something wrong with meeting business people.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition spent the last year travelling around and visiting nearly every boardroom in this country he could get into and meeting every chief executive officer and manager that he could. If he believes there is something wrong with meeting people in business-apparently he believed then that it was wrong to meet Mr Connell, but he did not mind Mr Bailey meeting him to lend him $2.3 billion to take over John Fairfax and Sons--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back directly to the revenue, and to something far more sinister. The Prime Minister made a reference to changed policy in his answer. Let me just recall these facts. In the 1987 election campaign the Opposition gave a commitment against the taxation of goldmining income, and so did the Government. The Government changed its policy when it introduced legislation in 1988 to tax the income of gold companies. The Opposition had, at the same time, indicated that it would support the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At an investment seminar in New York, Mr Howard said that the Opposition had given a commitment during the last election campaign to oppose a gold tax during the life of the current parliament, but it would be very hard to justify a tax exemption for one section of Australian industry over another. In other words, government and opposition opposing the taxation of gold; and government and opposition supporting the taxation of gold.</PARA>
<PARA> Then there was a change with Mr Peacock. He changed the Opposition's position on gold. There are some extensive reports of this, but more can be gleaned from it in the context of the current discussion because what we see is a very strong stand. On 9 November 1988, an article in the Age by Michelle Grattan, under the heading, `Coalition against gold tax for the time being' states:</PARA>
<PARA>While the West Australian Liberals want the Opposition locked into a promise to scrap the gold tax if elected, other Liberals want to keep the position open. Senator Noel Crichton-Browne spoke particularly strongly against the tax. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, recommending the legislation be opposed, said the Opposition had no choice given the strong commitments that Mr Howard had given. Senator Stone, while making it clear that this was not an economically logical decision, said there were times when a choice had to be made between political venality and economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA>It said that, after the May statement, Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would appear to me we wouldn't be making recommendations to block it.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it reports:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating said Mr Peacock appeared to have succumbed to political pressure and it appeared Mr Howard had been rolled.</PARA>
<PARA>On 10 November, the next day, a press release by Senator John Panizza, a Western Australian senator, appeared:</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australian Liberal politicians are particularly pleased with the decision of the Opposition to oppose a corporate tax on the gold industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `Western Australian Liberal politicians are particularly pleased'; the press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator John Panizza explained that the decision was a major success for members of the WA Branch of the party. Senator Panizza pointed out that the gold industry, especially in Western Australia, would benefit if the Liberal Party is successful in both the forthcoming Federal and State elections.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the gold industry would benefit if the Liberals were elected. Then a report appeared on 8 November which said, `Coalition rebuffs Howard on gold' by Peter Logue. It read:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition will oppose the Federal Government's planned gold tax in another rebuff to Liberal Leader, Mr Howard. Opposition from three Western Australians, along with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock, ensured Mr Howard's view had only minority support.</PARA>
<PARA>Those people were the honourable member for Pearce, Mr Chaney; the honourable member for Tangney, Mr Shack; and the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey. It said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Illustrative of the political pragmatism at work in this issue, was the decision by the Opposition spokesman, Mr Shack, to oppose the tax, putting his Western Australian loyalty before his normal economic rationalist stance. With an election looming in Australia's main goldmining State, neither Mr Shack nor his Western Australian colleagues, the Senate Leader Senator Fred Chaney and the spokesman for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Wilson Tuckey would support the Government proposal.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Chaney denied this yesterday but agreed that he would have said something about how `everyone has items which are important to his constituency', and this was important to him. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>If Chaney and Peacock had taken the position last year that they have now ultimately taken, it would have made things a lot easier for Howard.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that not only did the Opposition change its position on gold, it also changed its leader as a result. The fact is that it is the group which supported Mr Peacock and inveigled him into changing his public position on gold-that is, the honourable members for Pearce, O'Connor and Tangney and these Western Australian senators-who moved against Mr Howard. So what we see now, and what is supposed to be a vile attack upon the Prime Minister, is that the Liberal WA Inc. has actually changed policy on the gold tax and then changed the leader to make sure that the policy stuck.</PARA>
<PARA> Never in my time as a Federal member of parliament have I seen a more disgraceful claim than this by Senator Chaney in protecting the revenue of the Commonwealth. He made the point that everyone around the table had a distortion. This is the man who supposedly presents himself as someone who is virtuous, upright, upstanding and after good policy; a little goody two-shoes, unctuous Fred, who actually says that he has a distortion which suits him: the non-taxation of gold.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. If the December 1986 Cabinet decision was no gold tax for the life of the next parliament, and if there was tremendous political pressure to make this plain, why did the Government take nearly seven months to make its three-year commitment public? If the Prime Minister's tale is right, why did he expose his Government to huge and unnecessary damage by not making the Government's three-year commitment public until his letter was published on 10 July, the day before the election?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not repeat all the things that I said yesterday, when I provided the answer to the honourable member's question, but I thank him for asking it again today. As I say, I provided the House with a detailed account of the events leading up to the letter of 7 July 1987. As I said on that occasion, the reason for that letter was the political pressure created by the earlier letter of the then Opposition Leader on 26 June 1987. On this point it is interesting to note that in all the 14 press releases by Senators Durack and Chaney in the two-year period between June 1985 and 26 June 1987, none made a commitment for the next three-year term; not one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fairness, though, I would note that those press releases and the Liberal's resources and energy policy statement released on 19 June 1987 said that the next Liberal Government will not impose a tax on goldmining income-a pledge which you will note, Mr Speaker, is remarkably similar to mine on 15 June 1987. I remind the House that I was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if you are re-elected will there be a gold tax?</PARA>
<PARA>I answered, `No'. The point is that our written commitment for the next three-year term arose from the political advantage sought by the Opposition through its total and early capitulation to the demands of the goldmining industry for a written commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the question of the Opposition: what caused that capitulation on 26 June 1987 to the demands of the goldmining industry for a written commitment? The Opposition has to ask the question why it was that it succumbed to the pressure and gave the industry that commitment in writing. I have explained fully in the House, prior to today, what the pressures and political realities were that were building up in that period. I have said to the House, and I repeat, that as we came up to the election period any commitment on this matter which did not encompass the term of the next government was politically worthless. I made it quite clear that we did not want the situation, if we could avoid it, where we would put this in writing. If we did it, if we said yes to writing to this body, then we would be saying yes to everybody that came to us asking, `Will you put it in writing for this period of time?' and we would be in the situation where we would be doing it for thousands of organisations. We did not want to do that, but as we came-as I said in this House-towards the election situation, it was quite clear we had to indicate for the purposes of leading up to the election that in our period we would not do it. That is why I said the Government would not do it.</PARA>
<PARA> I made it quite clear, as I say, on 15 June in the radio broadcast that that applied to the period of the Government. Going back to the answer I gave earlier today on this question of what Mr Connell himself said he was seeking, he did not apparently have any doubt in his mind as to what the position was. He wanted a confirmation of it-and confirmation, as I say, can occur only when it is known and understood that that would, as it would have to do, apply to the whole period of the next Labor Government.</PARA>

There it was announced that staged reductions in tariffs on sugar were to go back to the situation where the tariff level would be $76 per tonne from 1 July this year and $55 per tonne from 1 July 1992, and that the prices prevailing at the time of the statement equalled the protection rates of about 28 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

<PARA>To pay private investigators to investigate people in the community, as a political party, is improper. I mean the United States found that at the time of the Watergate affair.</PARA>

Why do you not reverse your earlier decision and stand aside your good mate pending the finalisation of the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2652" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say, on this matter of Mr Burke, that it is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition could not get a proper and factual focus on this issue. I refer to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition described Mr Burke's leave arrangements as a special deal for special mates. The Leader of the Opposition is fundamentally wrong on that point. He is incapable of seeing that in this situation normal rules have been applied in regard to the circumstances that apply at this time. The only way in which the Opposition can analyse this issue is in terms of special deals for special mates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear that Mr Burke has sought three weeks special leave to allow him to appear at the Royal Commission. A grant of special leave is not uncommon in the Commonwealth Public Service. It is the established way to deal with exceptional circumstances. For all heads of our diplomatic missions, including career appointees, questions of conditions of service, such as eligibility for special leave, are determined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the advice of his Department. I understand that there are no relevant precedents to guide the Minister in determining the best course of action in the particular circumstances of Mr Burke.</PARA>
<PARA> In considering its advice to Senator Evans on the most appropriate way to address Mr Burke's situation, the Department was advised by the Department of Industrial Relations that special leave on full pay would be granted in the circumstances to a normal public servant. On the basis of this advice and on its assessment of the issues and interests involved, the Department recommended to Senator Evans that paid special leave should be granted. The Minister, Senator Evans, agreed to that recommendation. If the Royal Commission requires Mr Burke to stay in Australia for more than the three weeks now envisaged consideration will be given to extending these arrangements. The Royal Commission will pay Mr Burke's travel expenses. Mr Burke has not been stood down and on the completion of his special leave he would be expected to return.</PARA>
<PARA> I have gone to this issue at length on a number of occasions in this place. The point has now been reached when the Leader of the Opposition should stand up in this place and assert what his position of principle is. The only conclusion that I and the Government are able to draw from the position that has been advanced by the Leader of the Opposition is that his position of principle is this: if an allegation is made against an official, then that allegation of itself is sufficient to require the Government to stand down the person against whom the allegation is made. The conduct of the affairs of this place will be made much easier if the Leader of the Opposition will stand up and assert that that is his position. Is it the position of the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition that it is sufficient for an unsubstantiated allegation to be made and on that basis, and that basis alone, the person against whom the allegation is made should be stood down? If that is their position, let them state it.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be known that, as far as I and the Government are concerned, we will not embrace that position either on the grounds of morality or on the grounds of the proper functioning of government. It is immoral that we should have a position where a man can be impugned, an allegation made against him, and then he is stood down. It is immoral to prejudge him and say, `All right, you're guilty. Down you go'.</PARA>
<PARA> I also ask the Leader of the Opposition to understand what the implications for the functioning of government are. If that principle is applied then all that has to be done is for a series of unproven allegations to be made against public officials, Ministers, or whoever one likes, and that is still enough for them to be stood down.</PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to get up in this place and state what his principle is. Is his principle that it is sufficient for an unsubstantiated allegation to be made and that on that basis it is his view, his position, that in those circumstances a person should be stood down? If that is his position, he should state it. It is not the position of this Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a submission to the national wage case the Commonwealth put the view that now is the right time to introduce greater flexibility into the wage determination system by encouraging enterprise bargaining agreements. I am greatly disappointed that the Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in its decision today, refused to break away from the centralised wage fixing system. It awarded a 2 1/2 per cent increase to all employees under awards subject to the awards meeting certain criteria implementing its structural efficiency principles. It refused the Commonwealth's proposal for a $12 increase on the grounds that a flat increase would compress relativities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Commission believes a flat increase might compress relativities, it would certainly mean that the lower paid would be materially better off at 12 than someone on a higher income. For instance, a tradesman on $407 a week would receive $10.20 from the 2 1/2 per cent, but a Deputy President of the Commission would receive $64 a week on a salary of $132,000.</PARA>
<PARA> I disagree with the decision and I disagree most strongly with the conservatism of the Commission that has clung to the pre-eminent role of the national wage case awarding increases and postponed the introduction of a more flexible system of enterprise bargaining. It is only through enterprise bargaining that we can obtain the great productivity increases available from changing workplace arrangements and conditions and it is only through enterprise bargaining that we can make the wage system more responsive to the changing conditions of demand and supply or to different skills in different regions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the honourable member for Bennelong chime that we are hoist on our own petard. Let me put that fallacy down. What makes John such a simple person on wages is that in 1978, 1979 and 1980 he let the system go, believing that it was deregulated. Because the existing craft structure stayed in place, we had a wages explosion across awards, which dislocated the profit share and smashed Australian investment. There is no quick transition from the highly concentrated centralised system we have to a decentralised system without the transition which is of the variety encompassed in the accord mark 6 between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for a basic change to the restructuring of awards and underlying the structural efficiency principle providing for agreements between enterprises and unions to change the productivity of the business for a higher level of remuneration. I believe that now is the time to be making that transition. We would all like to see a more flexible labour market in this country, but we want to see one that will work, not one that will blow apart again a la Howard in 1979-80.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Mr Speaker. There is a simplistic view that one can go from a centralised structure which has existed in Australia for 90 years to a decentralised structure and that the structure and maturity of Australian business are such that such a transition can be handled quickly and accommodated easily. It cannot be, and that is why the Australian Labor Party, in government, has been the only party which has thought through this transition and why the case which was put to the Commission by the ACTU in accordance with the accord and the Government was, I think, the right case. The Commission has shown conservatism in the matter by not seizing the opportunity to see this transition take place when the labour market is weak. To lose months and months in another discussion is, I think, missing an opportunity which exists. The fact is that the 2 1/2 per cent can be accessed by employees, but again to the advantage of people on higher incomes, not lower incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I was also disappointed with the fact that the Commission refused the ACTU claim, supported by the Commonwealth, for the phased introduction of an addition to award superannuation. Superannuation has been the Government's preferred change to savings in Australia. It is now bigger than anyone imagined a few years ago. Not only will it provide Australia with a pool of savings but it will also deal with the demographics of the ageing of the Australian population by providing a retirement income as a top-up to the pension in the 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had the wit, with the ACTU, to introduce a scheme of privately funded national superannuation. It has not done this by going to the Commission; it has made these arrangements itself and sought the Commission to ratify them. The Commission has now recommended a national conference on the issue, presumably with the Commission sitting at the table. The fact is that superannuation is bigger than the Commission or the rest of us. Superannuation will continue. It will be one of the great principles of change of this Labor Government to provide a retirement income for ordinary working people. It will also be a salvation in that it will provide a pool of national savings to complement our own savings and diminish the call on overseas savings, which is of course the flip side of our national debt, the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is no outright rejection here by the Commission of the quantums in terms of the 2 1/2 per cent, the fact that it has rejected a flat $12 and has a set of conditions that need to be complied with to access this 2 1/2 per cent will mean that a wage increase of 2.2 per cent of average weekly earnings, which the Government in fact had been supporting, will end up being a more expensive wage increase of 2 1/2 per cent, more delayed, and will probably produce some industrial heartburn.</PARA>

But, in the absence of such advice, we get back to the basic question of principle. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition did not take up my challenge. He said, `I take this opportunity of answering the challenge put to me by the Prime Minister', and then conspicuously failed to answer it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the Cambodian issue, it is Australia's judgment-and I think that of the vast majority of other interested countries-that the United Nations peace plan for a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia, which Australia did much to initiate, still provides overwhelmingly the best way of ending the conflict and the suffering of the Cambodian people. The peace progress is moving forward slowly-more slowly than we would prefer. However, the cumulative achievements, particularly over the past year, do mean that a comprehensive solution is now clearly within grasp. I note that this judgment I have just made was confirmed by a detailed exposition of a United States policy towards Cambodia and Vietnam by Assistant Secretary of State Solomon in testimony before the House Asian Pacific Affairs Subcommittee on 10 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has been actively encouraging the key players to fix a specific timetable for the final negotiating phase, including the early reconvening of the Coordinating Committee of the Paris Conference on Cambodia. Deputy Secretary Costello, who has been tireless in his activities in this matter, visited Phnom Penh on 16 to 19 March and then went on to Hanoi on 20 and 21 March for discussion with Vietnamese and State of Cambodia leaders. In those talks, both the SOC and Vietnam reaffirmed their commitment of the comprehensive settlement process and their readiness to move on to the next steps.</PARA>
<PARA> All Cambodian parties have now indicated their support for the early convening of a second meeting between the Paris Conference co-chairmen-Indonesia and France-and the members of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, to discuss further the draft text prepared by the Permanent Five. According to the latest reports, the meeting is expected to take place in Jakarta around the middle of May. All along, Australia has recognised the inherent difficulty of achieving a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict. Even allowing for the progress that has been made, we are far from complacent about the difficult steps that lie ahead. The view we have taken consistently is that the best way to test fully the commitment of Vietnam, the Phnom Penh regime and other principal parties is to carry forward the process as quickly as possible to its final negotiating phase.</PARA>
<PARA> In that sense we very much welcome the latest move by the United States to move the peace process forward by explaining directly to Vietnam and to the State of Cambodia the benefits that will flow in terms of more constructive relations with the United States once a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict is signed. I am sure that all members of the House hope that this movement forward will continue in the interests of peace in this region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition cannot get away from this point: is it or is it not saying that any representative of this Government, whether it is Mr Burke or any other representative, is entitled to have the proper and traditional protection that is afforded to any public servant in a situation where, if an allegation is made and a person has to appear-obviously, as for Mr Burke, or anyone else who is serving the Government-arrangements would be made for that person to have leave to appear before the tribunal in which the allegations have been made?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assume that the Opposition takes the view that that is a right which should apply to anyone who is serving the Commonwealth. If it is not saying that, it should make it clear. Is its position that if someone serving the Commonwealth-whether in Australia or overseas-has an allegation made about him in a tribunal, he has the right to come back to prepare himself for and appear before that tribunal? If the Opposition is saying that he has not got that right, it should say it clearly and we will know precisely what its standards are.</PARA>
<PARA> What this Government is doing is saying, in respect of someone who is serving the Commonwealth and against whom an allegation has been made, that that person has made an application for special leave and on the advice of the relevant departments-the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-that leave is being provided with pay. The Opposition seems to have a different position. Let the people of this country know the position of the Opposition. It is that if some public servant is so accused, has allegations made about him and is to appear before that tribunal to prepare his defence he is not entitled to anything-such people are to be stripped of their salary simply because the allegation has been made. They have to go and appear, stripped of their salary on the basis that an allegation has been made. That is the position the Opposition has adopted.</PARA>

Secondly, I challenge him to answer this question: is it the position of the Leader of the Opposition-or just the position of the honourable member for Moore-that if an allegation is made against a servant of the Commonwealth and he is required to come back and prepare himself to go before that tribunal, that public servant shall not have leave, shall be stripped of his salary?

Nor would the lessons that can be learnt from looking across the Tasman carry very much weight with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Government does not intend to move away from consistent policies designed to protect those who are most disadvantaged, those who are unemployed; it will protect families notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances. Despite significant unemployment and continuing economic difficulties, we have seen a recognition and a willingness on the part of the Government not only to improve the safety net but also to ensure that there are significant reforms. We have set standards and benchmarks in relation to family payments; we have ensured that family payments were indexed for the first time; we have linked the improved social security system to retirement income policy as far as the aged are concerned, involving occupational superannuation and providing greater security for their retirement for people in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the demonstrations that have taken place in New Zealand, and perhaps some of the underlying causes of those demonstrations, we see that in difficult economic circumstances that Government has sought to take it out on those who are least able to care for themselves. So we have seen a reduction in the standard single rate of unemployment benefit by $14, or nearly 10 per cent, despite the rising unemployment; a massive cut in unemployment benefit; a reduction in the standard single rate of sickness benefit by $27 to $135, or a 17 per cent cut-reminding us of the commitments made by the Opposition in the last election campaign; and a reduction of $25-$NZ27-per week in the benefit rates for couples with children and sole parents. In these difficult economic circumstances we have seen, on the part of the conservatives in New Zealand, a willingness to effectively remove the family allowance system with all the impact that that has on those families, particularly the families where there is no adult unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the honourable member for Farrer what the implication of this is in terms of the Australian situation. The implication for Australia is clearly that we can decide to govern on the basis of principle: we can govern in a way that, despite difficult circumstances, ensures that we care for those who are most disadvantaged and ensures that the social security system is not only protected but is also made more flexible to ensure that people can move into the work force; or we can turn against families, the unemployed, those who are sick and disabled, and ensure that they bear the real costs in any recession in terms of economic difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government intends to maintain its social security system, which is there to cope with difficult economic circumstances and not to be dumped to serve the interests of a party that has no interest in principle but in fact chooses to attack the weak.</PARA>

The fact is that these are matters that the Western Australian royal commission should inquire into-these relationships on the Liberal side-because they are so well chronicled and they have been so effective in changing the Opposition's policy and removing its Leader who wanted to join with the Government and tax the income from goldmining companies. It is the relationships of the honourable members for Pearce, O'Connor and Tangney and Senators Crichton-Browne and Panizza which ought to be examined. They should be brought before the Western Australian royal commission to find out what their relationship with this long-established industry really has been; including, lately, Alan Bond and, for that matter, Mr Connell.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Denison for his question. Last week the United Nations Security Council accepted Iraq's response to the Security Council cease-fire resolution 687. As a result, hostilities are now formally concluded. The terms of the cease-fire set out in resolution 687 are comprehensive. They require Iraq to accept and respect Kuwait's established borders, pay reparations, destroy its weapons of mass destruction and accept a demilitarised zone along the Iraq-Kuwaiti border.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The successful implementation and monitoring of the cease-fire is vital for the future peace of the region and for the authority of the United Nations. This is evidently a major and complex task. The United Nations is now setting out to establish the necessary machinery for that task to be discharged. Australia has been consulting its allies about how we could best contribute. In the light of our internationally recognised and respected expertise and commitment in the field of chemical disarmament, it has been agreed that the best contribution we could make would be in that field. We have therefore advised the United Nations that Australia is prepared to provide staff to the special commission set up under resolution 687 to monitor and implement the destruction of Iraq's chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.</PARA>
<PARA> We are prepared to provide experts in chemical weapons as well as administrative and logistic support for the commission. Our offer to the United Nations envisages that our contribution could comprise 20 to 25 people, and the work of the commission might last for some years. It is, of course, up to the United Nations to determine the final composition of the special commission and other organisations established under the cease-fire. I conclude by saying to the honourable member, who I know has a very sincere interest in this matter, that our offer reflects not only our unswerving support for the role that the United Nations has taken in the Gulf crisis, but also, very importantly, our longstanding commitment to chemical weapons disarmament.</PARA>

<PARA>. . . the Leader of the National Party, when referring to the gold tax issue, quoted the transcript of the Royal Commission . . . :</PARA>
<PARA>`Did the Prime Minister have anything to say on the question?' to which Mr Connell replied:</PARA>

<PARA>I go on quoting the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it did not suit the purposes of the Leader of the National Party to go on and quote . . . what followed in the transcript'. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to page 2575 of Hansard yesterday, and my speech-perhaps one of my better speeches-in the debate for the suspension of standing and sessional orders. What I said is very important to this serious matter of misrepresentation and misleading the Parliament. At that page I said:</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Prime Minister raise it?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell: I don't recall. </PARA>
<PARA>Did the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA>Connell:-</PARA>
<PARA>these are my words in the House, as recorded in Hansard-</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, I believe he did. He was able to confirm that the gold tax would not be introduced and that was of considerable interest to me, my company Paragon Resources, and the companies of Alan Bond. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the printed record that has arisen in part from the records of the scribes in the House. It has also arisen from the documentation which I tendered to Hansard in accordance with normal convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the start of Question Time, when the Prime Minister raised this, as a matter of courtesy I have signified my concern. I then went and checked with a senior officer of Hansard in relation to the actual tape of the proceedings of yesterday. The senior officer of Hansard has advised me-just half an hour ago-that in fact I did say that entire paragraph. In other words, that I did quote beyond the words, `Yes, I believe he did'. I did go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>He was able to confirm that the gold tax would not be introduced . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen evidence in this House today of the abysmal standards of the Government and we now move on to the next of the sorry episodes that have characterised this Government-the mismanagement of education in this country and the establishment of the export of education industry by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The crisis in confidence in education in this country, which touches higher education, schooling and all those involved in the export of education, is in large measure because of the `bull in the china shop' approach to policy and administration adopted by this Minister. The Minister has a very characteristic stamp which he has put on every aspect of policy under his control. This is the big, bold, bright idea-a rush to implementation and an almost total disregard for the consequences-indeed, a patent unwillingness to return and to assess the effects of what he has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In education, the Minister's approach has been bolstered by a historically false and intellectually naive confidence in the power of governments and central administrations to know what is best. The result is that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is not a great educational reformer; he is instead a destroyer, a cause of uncertainty and chaos throughout education in this country. The double tragedy is that, at the very moment when so much in education needs attention, improvement and reform, the Minister has done so much damage to the foundations, both human and material, upon which a genuine reform program might have been developed. </PARA>
<PARA> If one thing highlights the incompetence of this Minister for the task which the Prime Minister has given him, it is the disaster of what has been dubbed in newspaper language the foreign student scam. One of the Minister's bright ideas was to correct the balance of payments deficit-he took it on himself to do this-by pumping up as rapidly as possible the export of education. </PARA>
<PARA> In his drive to create and treat education as an industry, to regard it in a purely instrumental way rather than something on which the reputation of this country depends and which can develop the intellectual, moral and social potential of individuals, the Minister, by his ill-considered actions, has tarnished, undermined and severely damaged the international reputation of our education institutions, both public and private-a reputation for outstanding quality which was developed under previous coalition governments. All that has been squandered by the actions of this Minister. He has wrecked the orderly administration of Australia's immigration policy. He has left stranded in this country large numbers of often destitute foreign students who still do not have the benefit of clear decisions from the Government about their futures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian taxpayer is paying a heavy price, both for those students who found the door finally slammed in their faces-in the last Budget $50m was allocated for those students-and for those students who were admitted and now often find themselves in need of social security and health care. This Parliament has never had an explanation of why this disaster was allowed to happen. There has never been any public accounting or explanation by this Minister of why this problem was allowed to grow and grow before the doors were finally slammed shut, too late. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet all of this could have been avoided if only the Minister had listened. But this Minister does not listen. When a person knows that he commands the administrative means to convert his truth into practical policy, he knows he does not have to listen. This refusal to listen and take heed has set the tenor of this Minister's time in his portfolio. Whether it be in the field of higher education, research, schooling or curriculum, or whether it be in funding or institutional arrangements, the Minister has not listened. As one frustrated State officer in the Minister's department wrote in one memorandum in recent years:</PARA>
<PARA>Criticisms have been unacknowledged and there have been frank admissions throughout this whole period of this unbridled flow of purported students into this country, some of whom were genuine, many of whom were not; nothing will be changed until there is a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>It is only now that the people of this country are beginning to learn what kind of character this Minister has become. The Minister knew and, as early as July 1987, his department knew. In a minute to the Minister his department stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There are also fears that some non bona fide applicants may be applying for English language studies with motives such as full time work in Australia or long term stay as the primary intention. </PARA>
<PARA>The same minute advised the Minister that the English language intensive courses for overseas students industry was already setting up its own regulations for the industry and was attempting, on its own initiative, to restrict the flow of illegals. The Minister's department continued to be very well informed by the industry about this activity and the reasons for it. There were a few bad apples in the language college bucket and the industry was keen to have them removed. Effective government assistance would have been useful to the industry. Yet nothing was done. A letter dated 13 April 1988 from one school complained:</PARA>
<PARA>What is extremely frustrating is that no action has been taken by the OSO to withdraw accreditation from the institutions whose practices have been the subject of official complaints. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only did the Minister refuse to come to the assistance of the industry in this government generated crisis but he rejected the very strong advice of his colleague in Government, the former Minister for Immigration, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). Documents now in the public domain as a result of our freedom of information request clearly show that the former Minister and his departmental officers were well aware of the problems with illegals and that they tried to stop it. But Mr Holding and his department were up against a Prime Minister then totally immersed in his unrealistic courtship of China and a Minister who saw himself as the saviour of the balance of payments-two fantasies which were to have deplorably serious consequences for tens of thousands of people and for Australia's reputation. Let me quote one sentence from this letter that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports sent to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>My overseas officers indicate that while it remains easier for persons to be admitted to Australia as students [with a work permit] than as tourists the courses will thrive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how careful the screening was. Yet the Minister and the Minister's Department made it clear that they were not going to act. In a minute dated 22 September 1988 from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, we read the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The problems had been identified at an early date by this office, as far back as October 1987. No one in Canberra has wanted to know about it and the measures taken to date are not going to do anything to solve the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>This assessment was blindingly accurate. Both the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and his senior officials clearly chose to deny the meaning of the evidence before them. In an extraordinary minute dated 12 April 1988 from a senior official in the Minister's Department we find the confirmation of that. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>DILGEA statistics indicate that there may be an overstay problem with PRC students. </PARA>
<PARA>Those statistics indicated that beyond question. The minute continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Media reports also indicate PRC students in particular may be undertaking full time employment. To counter these problems DILGEA has proposed the introduction of more stringent bona fides testing and removal of work allowance for students undertaking short term courses. In the absence of any firm evidence to support DILGEA's claims, the Department will resist the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>There are none so blind as those who will not see. Not until late 1990 do we find a clear admission in an inward cablegram from Beijing to Canberra that most ELICOS applicants from the People's Republic of China are not genuine students. </PARA>
<PARA> The result is that, of an existing 90,000 illegal immigrants in Australia, a further estimated 30,000 have been added to the total by this Minister. The result is that criminals-drug couriers-have used the ELICOS loophole in the administration of our immigration policy to get into this country. According to Australian Federal Police reports, possibly up to 150 drug couriers have entered. No less than 10 were arrested as they entered Australia on student visas. The result of this foreign student scam, as the press calls it, is that potential students from countries other than the People's Republic of China-students with genuine educational intentions-have been turned away from Australia by the ruin of our reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this whole sorry episode the Minister has sought to blame the victims-those who responded to his call to provide educational services so that he could achieve his fantastic objectives. He should have acted sooner to bring them into line, he said. They should have acted sooner. The States should have acted sooner. It seems that everyone should have acted except the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> But, when the Minister did act, the chaos continued. He first handed responsibility for regulation to the States; then in November last year he introduced legislation into this Parliament at short notice-such short notice that no-one in the industry knew that this legislation had been introduced or what it contained. We in the Opposition had to inform them as to the Minister's intentions in this legislation. Universities were astonished to find that they were covered by this legislation, as were the non-government schools. The States were baffled by the fact that this legislation had been introduced after the Minister had handed responsibility to them. Then, of course, there followed a flurry of consultations and a host of amendments introduced in the Senate. A Senate committee, chaired by a member of the Minister's Party, has made it clear that it will not be rushed by the Minister to push this legislation through the Senate. It is going to examine it clause by clause and make sure that, if any framework is to be put down by this Parliament, it is going to be a satisfactory one because no satisfactory framework has been put forward by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Worst of all, there has been no recovery of Australia's reputation in our region. Professor Ken McKinnon, now President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, in an address late last year, summed up the situation as it is seen throughout the education sector when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>To put it bluntly, the Australian Government is making a mess of its policies towards overseas students. There is disarray within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That was after the clampdown on the students from China. This is the commentary on the current state of policy. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The policies are increasingly making Australia look inhuman, incompetent and financially gouging. </PARA>
<PARA>This disaster in the field of ELICOS is only a shadow of the crisis developing across the whole spectrum of Australian education that this Minister has set in train. In higher education the Minister's achievement has been to provoke an unparalleled brain drain of outstanding academics from this country. The demoralisation he has spread is one of the main reasons why Australia is facing over the next decade a huge shortage of qualified academics. </PARA>
<PARA> But the last word should go to one of the Minister's own Labor Party colleagues-the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss. The Minister has admitted-he has admitted it in a confused way, but he has admitted it-that there has never been greater questioning of Australia's schooling than there is at present after eight years of this Government. So he thought he would put schools on the agenda at the Special Premiers Conference. What happened? Mr Goss said that education was not on the agenda because of Mr Dawkins's bungling. Suddenly the proposal was thrown into the ring without any supporting policy, without any position paper, and the Premiers were not prepared to accept that sort of slapdash late attempt to push something through that had not been the subject of discussion and negotiation. In Queensland's Sunday Sun, Premier Goss put it more bluntly:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins, he said has been incompetent and arrogant in the way he has approached the matter.''</PARA>
<PARA>That is the model of what has happened in the export of education industry. For the future of education in this country, the Prime Minister has only one option: dump Dawkins. </PARA>

Of course, it comes as an enormous disappointment to find that all he has been able to do today has been to repeat some histrionic assertions and to rely on a couple of tawdry facts in this attack, not on me but on a major and developing industry in this country. It is not me who has been savaged by this shadow Minister. It is the sabotage that he is wreaking on this industry which is of great concern to me. I will just give a feeling for what is at stake here-what has grown from nothing to something in the space of a few years.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just sit down and be quiet. The fact is that a few years ago the number of students coming here and paying full fees was very small-a few dozen maybe. What we now have is an industry the value of which I accept is difficult to quantify, but one figure which is being used now in the context of the Industry Commission's investigation into the costs and benefits of this industry is $700m a year. That is what it is estimated that this industry is worth. This $700m a year comes from the payment of fees, the use of foreign funds to pay living expenses, the contribution to air fares coming to and from Australia and all those kinds of things. How does that $700m line up in relation to our other export industries? It is three times the value of the exports of live animals from this country-three times the exports of our live sheep, cattle and other animals going from this country. It is about half as important as our wheat industry. The export of unmilled wheat is only twice as big as this industry. It is about three times as big as the export of wine from this country-another industry which has grown quite strongly in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the allegation? What is the basis of the attack on this industry? Putting entirely to one side the obsession of the honourable member for Goldstein with my personality, I ask: what is it that he has used to back up an attack on a major industry, one which is already making an enormous contribution to Australia and is already extending Australia's influence as a provider of education and training services throughout the region? The honourable member for Goldstein is rather like Henny Penny running around, screeching his head off, waiting for the sky to fall in -in this case, a sort of hirsute Henny Penny. What is the basis of the attacks that he has brought against me or against this industry?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course this industry has grown rapidly. If we look at the number of overseas students in higher education, we will see that there were no students in 1986 under this program and that now there are 14,000 full fee paying students in our universities. From what the honourable member has said, where is there a skerrick of evidence about maladministration in that area? Nothing he said related to the question of higher education, because nothing can be said in attacking this great growth that has occurred. There are 14,500 overseas students happily studying in our universities. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the honourable member for Goldstein is relying on the fact that in the English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) there has been a great growth which has reached 17,000 students in a very short time. He ran around trying to confirm some slander, some ill-based assertions to justify his continuing attack. This attack by the honourable member for Goldstein started months and months ago. He was hardly in the position of shadow Minister when he started attacking me in this area. He could not find the evidence. In the end, he was unable to find evidence and he did not have the guts to come in here and ask me a few questions about it. If it is such a scam, if it is such a scandal, how come he has not asked me one single question in this House about it? He put in a freedom of information request with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. He thought, `I'll get him; I'll get Dawkins'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing at all wrong with that. He thought that hidden in the Department was the evidence of my incompetence and my lack of attention to detail in this program. What happened was that he was delivered 5,000 separate documents from my Department and from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA). From all of those 5,000 documents what was he able to rely on in order to justify expressions such as `tarnish the industry' and `severely damage this industry' and suggestions that I had squandered this great opportunity and wrecked the industry through maladministration? What can he rely on?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall tell honourable members what it is. The honourable member for Goldstein discovered that there were a couple of Thai tarts here, a couple of prostitutes from Thailand. That is what he discovered-not in the papers he got from me, but from the papers that he got from DILGEA; an unsubstantiated report that DILGEA would not put its name to and which related to the alleged illegal entry of a couple of Thai prostitutes. That is what he has based this on. The honourable member for Goldstein talks about drug runners, sex, prostitution and all that sort of stuff. Two tarts from Thailand was all he was able to uncover in order to get a headline on this issue. No scandal, no maladministration, but just a couple of poor little girls from Thailand who arrived here, who engaged in this particular activity, who were caught and who were then thrown out of the country. If anything, his revelations indicated the effectiveness of the compliance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> What about these drug runners? The honourable member for Goldstein says that there are `hundreds' of drug runners. It may come as a surprise to the honourable member for Goldstein to note that in 1989 about 915 suspected drug runners, couriers and others were apprehended at the Customs barrier. In these papers he was again able to discover an unsubstantiated report that perhaps 10 suspected drug couriers from Colombia were apprehended, turned around and sent away. Of course, people will be apprehended. That is why we have such an elaborate arrangement. Here we have two Thai tarts and 10 suspected drug couriers out of how many? Out of 110,000 students who had come to this country under the decisions that we took! What could the honourable member for Goldstein discover from poring over 5,000 separate pieces of paper that he scanned looking for the evidence of my maladministration?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, he selectively released these documents, but what he found did not please him. What he found revealed that every time there was a substantiated allegation, I did act. The papers revealed that I had acted in relation to every occasion when a substantiated complaint had been made. The honourable member for Goldstein relies on the letter of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). That letter came from the Department which had opposed the relaxation of the entry provisions of the student program in the first instance. The Department had never wanted to allow any of these students into the country. It wanted to continue to apply the bona fide arrangements in a way which would discourage all students from ever coming here and would have meant that students from our region continued to go to North America and Europe. Of course the Department had concerns and of course it wrote in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I was determined not to turn the clock back and wipe out an industry we were just getting onto its feet. That would have been the effect of my accepting the recommendations of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports at that time. I said to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, `We do not need to go to that extreme; we do not need to go back to the old rules, which prevented students coming here at all. We can manage this program and deal with the problems as they arise'. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports essentially agreed to that process and to a number of measures being taken, measures which continued with his successor. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall take the opportunity later to table a note which has been prepared by the Deputy Secretary of my Department, Mr Hickey, which indicates quite clearly what the honourable member for Goldstein would not indicate because he would not release and publish all of the documents that we provided to him, the documents which would have revealed what action that I took, not just from the period of the letter of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports but before that in terms of what was needed to get this industry cleaned up in areas where it was obviously deficient. </PARA>
<PARA> This note from Mr Hickey reveals that in the first half of 1987 he was first aware of the emerging pattern coming out of China and, therefore, we introduced living allowance and the prepayment of tuition fees in order to deal with that particular question. It goes on to indicate about half a dozen or so different occasions when we took action to tighten the arrangements, to improve the administration, to remind the industry of its obligation as far as these matters were concerned. Mr Hickey also related to the question of what the role of DILGEA was and, maybe, should have been in this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein has forgotten that my Department is not responsible for the issue of visas; it is the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It was not my Department which was responsible for apprehending the illegal immigrants or chucking them out. However, we tried to encourage the industry to report any students who were not turning up to the proper authorities and we did urge the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to take action in those particular cases. Immigration's problem was that it did not have the resources. It now has them and, therefore, we are seeing those people who are breaching the conditions of their visas being tossed out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that anyone who was even a B grade professor in one of our better universities would understand that it is important to get one's facts right before one makes these assertions. But the facts that the honourable member for Goldstein found did not suit him and, therefore, he ignored them and he just relied on the innuendo, the assertion and the scuttlebutt around the industry in order to manufacture his case against me. The height of hypocrisy arrived when we decided that we had to legislate. We could not rely on the States, we could not rely on the self-regulation of the industry and we had to regulate it ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Bill was hastily drafted. I said it would be. I also said that once it was through the House of Representatives I would consult with the industry before finalising its form in the Senate. One of the few advantages of a bicameral system is that that can be done. At the time I introduced it I said that I would do that and I did consult with the industry. A week before we introduced the legislation, this bloke was up on his feet saying, `It's about time you did something to regulate the industry'. A week later when I introduced the Bill, he said, `This Bill will kill the industry'. So he cannot get it right on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to lay the deceit on his part about what has happened to the industry. Since we introduced the new rules in the middle of last year, there has been a major decline in the number of ELICOS students coming from China from 7,000 to 370. That is exactly the result we wanted. To say that this has spread to other areas is quite untrue. In the last six months of last year the numbers of students have increased in Bangkok, Korea and a number of other areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not killed the industry. In this industry, even in the English language area, which has been the only area of concern, of the 300 institutions and colleges which now exist serving this industry, only 15 have been in trouble. Of the 110,000 students who have come to this country, essentially only a handful have fallen foul of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein has a lot of answering to do. He is trying to sabotage a new and infant industry by these loose accusations which are personally based. They have nothing to do with reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak in this matter of public importance. It is an issue of considerable moment. There have been no histrionic assertions from this side of the House; there have been no tawdry allegations; there has been no attempt on the part of the Opposition to sabotage a scheme in the public interest. What has happened is that there has been an absolute and undoubted failure on the part of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in relation to the administration of a program for which he is ministerially responsible and accountable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it very clear: this Minister has made it his particular credo that he is a can-do Minister. He has a manic desire to get his own way and to put in place a program for which he will be remembered. I assure him that he will be well remembered because he has sabotaged the Australian public interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it very clear: today the Premier of Victoria made one remarkable claim as the Minister for Small Business, Mr Rowe, resigned for some rather indiscreet comments uttered anonymously. She said that she had re-established ministerial accountability. If ministerial accountability meant anything, this Minister should have resigned. The Prime Minister should have called for his resignation or sacked him if he did not resign. He has damaged the Australian economy; he has damaged his own Government; he has shown a disregard for the Westminster conventions; he has shown a cavalier disregard for the Government's own policy in the area of national language; and now he runs away from the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Minister has done something even more severe than that in my judgment: he has damaged Australian society by bringing into total and absolute disrepute our immigration program. He has facilitated the entry of a large number of people into Australia. They are here illegally and have no right to remain in this country. It has done long term damage to Australia. This is the principal issue upon which the Minister should be held accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not dispute that in the area of selling education to people from abroad there are important objectives to be gained if we are able to put such programs in place. In fact, when the Jackson Committee of Review on the Australian Overseas Aid Program reported and called for such programs to be developed, the Opposition gave voice to the need for programs in that area. But that is no excuse for misadministration or for maladministration by the Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now acknowledges that we have of the order of 90,000 illegal entrants in this country. I believe that grossly understates the number of people who are here illegally. The figures that were provided by the Government never included the 20,000 entrants from the People's Republic of China (PRC) who were granted temporary entry after the events in Tiananmen Square. The fact is that the Government has not included the 25,000 people from the PRC who were permitted entry under the pipeline processing arrangements put in place by this Government to facilitate entry after Tiananmen Square. The Government's program in this area failed because this Minister refused to put the proper arrangements in place to check the bona fides of entrants under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the charge that the Minister ignored in all his comments today. It was not an issue of benefit derived from selling education, it was not an issue as to whether or not the 1,700 students who had been able to come here into our higher education institutions were bona fide students; the issue was whether or not of the 110,000 students who came in under the English language intensive courses for overseas students, or ELICOS, program, the 45,000 students from the People's Republic of China have contributed significantly to the number of illegal entrants in this country. That was the issue. When one considers those numbers in relation to the whole, the enormity of that problem can be well and truly understood. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence was in the papers provided by the Minister and by the Department under the Freedom of Information Act. The Minister for Immigration was not a man who was putting forward the arguments of his Department in a vacuum, he was a man briefed by his Department. He well knew that programs in this area could lead to abuse and was seeking to offer warnings to those who were involved. The warnings were clear and unambiguous. </PARA>
<PARA> When Minister Holding wrote in this document to the Prime Minister he was not giving anecdotal evidence; he was giving objective material that had been provided to him about the extent of the overstay problem already evident. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Data which have only recently become available support that view. For example, at end January 1988, 29 percent of the 1987 ELICOS student arrivals still had not left Australia despite the expiry of their entry permit and have now overstayed by up to 10 months . . . The data indicate that this overstay rate is increasing, and is especially high for students from the People's Republic of China and Korea. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I am also aware that there appear to be some organised abuse of the program which involves overseas students working full-time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>There was clear and unambiguous evidence available at that time which suggested no more than that the arrangements that the Minister has now told us have been put in place to check bona fides have reduced the number of entrants from the PRC from 7,000 to 370-a result which the Minister tells us now was exactly the one wanted. That was the result that was wanted back in 1988; that was the result that was wanted in 1989; that was the result that was wanted in 1990. The Government continued, even when it knew all that, to put in place programs which brought to us a large number of overstayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, on 21 November 1989-I refer to page 2969 of Hansard-gave us the information that is the most damning indictment of this Minister. He told us:</PARA>
<PARA>The overstay rate at the end of May 1989 for students from the People's Republic of China was 40 per cent. Since 1 January 1986, 15,111 PRC students have arrived in Australia and up to the end of May 1989 only 1,685 (or 11.2 per cent) had left Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>What he was telling us was that that 40 per cent understated the problem, because the rest were still here under visas which permitted them to remain; otherwise they would have been illegal too. After that the Government put in place an arrangement for those students who were demonstrating in Peking that they could not come to Australia-25,000 of them in the form of applications-and those people were allowed into Australia under what the Government euphemistically called pipeline processing. What was pipeline processing? I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>`Pipeline' applicants will be assessed against a lower education level criterion (year 10 compared with year 12 for the global measures) and will not be subject to more extensive immigration bona fides testing . . . Immigration bona fides tests are applied to assess the applicant against the stated purpose or reason for wanting to come to Australia and likely compliance with the entry conditions . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So the Government put those tests aside and allowed another 20,000 people into Australia. And what do we know of that? We know right now that over 8,000 of them-students from the People's Republic of China-are applying to stay in Australia as refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that our immigration program-Australia's national interest-has been compromised by this Minister. No amount of bluster can overcome it. The Minister should have been sacked for that reason alone. But there is the catalogue of other events which have taken place. If the Westminster system meant anything, this Minister should not have been dropped; he should have been shafted as quickly as the Minister and the Prime Minister could make it possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just been addressing a group of primary school students from my area. I described to those students the theatre of parliament and how it is somewhat laughable at times when people shout across the table. I find the allegations here somewhat laughable. This is theatre, not at its best-probably at its worst-because these allegations are very, very old. This stuff goes back to 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) clearly has been on top of the allegations made about those studying English language intensive courses for overseas students and has worked since that time to make sure that any damage that has been done to the industry has, firstly, been minimised and, secondly, reversed. When we read the figures we find that this is a prosperous and booming industry. </PARA>
<PARA> People use the term `ELICOS'-English language intensive courses for overseas students-all the time. These courses were designed to give people, mainly from Asian countries, the opportunity to come here and study, paying fees. In that sense they were an export effort on the part of the education community of Australia. They have been very successful in that regard. No-one would suggest that people from Asian countries do not have a poor background. A number of them-and the Minister has already said this-have used the ELICOS program as a means of queue-jumping, as a means of trying to stay in Australia, or to earn money before heading back to their land of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been particularly so in the case of people from the People's Republic of China. We know that. We understood it early on. We have constantly moved to change regulations so that we could exclude those sorts of people and those sorts of actions but, importantly, not to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. We do not want to ruin the ELICOS industry. We do not want to ruin this mighty export effort on the part of the education industry. We do want to tighten it up. We have tightened it up and we will continue to monitor it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) used to be a nice fellow-rather, I used to have a lot of regard for him. He was a professor at Monash University, my old university. At the time I was a postgraduate student he was publishing material on the relationship between various class groups and voting habits. I remember the book; it really was a very good book. Of course, we could not agree with all of its conclusions; nevertheless, there was a great deal of integrity, thought and proficiency in the study. To come here today and move away from that position of integrity and serve up this nonsense is a real pity. Perhaps the honourable member ought to go back to Monash University and do something useful in society. He should not muck around with this nonsense and these allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, we have been very successful in our export of education. Some of the ELICOS colleges which have gone broke in recent years have gone broke because certain colleges set themselves up exclusively to take students mainly from the People's Republic of China in order to make sure they would undertake these intensive English language courses. The point is that some of those colleges were not good managers of money, and some of them were clearly in the business to rort it. We know that, and we have been hard on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members know when most of them crashed? Do honourable members know when the real problem arose? It arose because of the Tiananmen Square event, that disgraceful event where the People's Republic of China repressed its own people who were asking for and demanding democracy in June 1989. From that point on students who wanted to come to Australia under any guise were stopped. So all those people who were in the business of making a quid out of those students, and who exclusively based their income making capacity on those students, went broke. Of course they went broke! Their source of supply stopped overnight as of June 1989. So it was obvious that a certain number of businesses which had based their capacity to make income solely on those students would go broke because of the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a fault of this Government. It has very little to do with this Government. But the fact is that some of the colleges went out of business because of those actions. So when people cite figures about colleges which have gone bust, they need to explain very clearly to those listening to this debate that much of that damage was done by the People's Republic of China itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at some of the contributions to this debate. The honourable member for Goldstein has really been trying hard to get this particular debate onto the agenda. He has even been trying hard to get any sort of media coverage. He had a radio interview recently with the famous Ron Casey of Sydney on 2KY on 27 March 1991. What the honourable member for Goldstein was attempting to say was that there are all sorts of terrible people being imported under this scheme, that they should be here to learn the English language but in fact they become prostitutes, drug runners and whatever else. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the Minister supplied the honourable member for Goldstein with some 5,000 documents, do honourable members know what he found out? Not a lot: not a great deal whatsoever. In fact the whole thing was a bit of a boilover. But Ron Casey, our dear friend from Sydney, in his interview-and Ron is no friend of the immigration program, as we all know-revealed the whole thing. I will take a little time to read through this. On 2KY on 27 March 1991 Casey said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I would like you now to go on to just what illegal activities these people have been up to because that really is the core issue. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case it was. Dr Kemp replied:</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly one of the core issues and the illegal activities involve breaches of visa regulations, undertaking employment which they were not entitled to undertake. There are allegations of the theft of documents . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Terrific! Casey asked:</PARA>
<PARA>But with the greatest respect, Dr Kemp, to what degree? Are we talking a large proportion of the students or are we talking about isolated incidents and we are tarring everyone with the same brush? I must get some specifics from you. </PARA>
<PARA>DR KEMP: We are certainly not tarring everybody and I think we have to make it quite clear that there are a limited number of students involved in each of these offences.</PARA>
<PARA>Casey-still at it, good man-continued:</PARA>
<PARA>What proportion, would you put a guesstimate on it?</PARA>
<PARA>DR KEMP: I wouldn't attempt to put an estimate on the proportion of students who are involved in these sort of offences. These are offences investigated by the police and reported to the department. </PARA>
<PARA>Casey, by now almost exhausted, with time running out and the news coming up:</PARA>
<PARA>Given that I have already admitted that I believe that these language students coming from the east are for the most part queue jumpers-</PARA>
<PARA>putting his own view-</PARA>
<PARA>I have not been able to get anything substantial out of you. </PARA>
<PARA>`You' being the honourable member for Goldstein. The honourable member in reply:</PARA>
<PARA>These documents that we have released clearly show that there were students that were involved in this. </PARA>
<PARA>Casey, exasperated:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, but one student, two students, out of the tens of thousands. I mean all we have done is to blacken the reputation and made them criminals of just about every Asian language student--</PARA>

<PARA> . . . that has come to this country in the last four years and you will not be specific as to what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA>DR KEMP: No, I am quite specific about it. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we go; we are finally getting to it:</PARA>
<PARA>CASEY: Give me numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>DR KEMP: Each of these are documented and we are talking about students-certainly we are not talking about--</PARA>
<PARA>CASEY: You are talking about a minuscule number that you have blown up into a big story. </PARA>
<PARA>DR KEMP: No, I haven't blown it up into a story, this is one of many documents. </PARA>
<PARA>CASEY: I am not impressed. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on. At the end of the day Casey wiped the interview because it was absolutely useless. I suppose that Casey contributed to the beat-up in the sense that he bothered even to interview the honourable member for Goldstein, but Casey at least said, `Put up or shut up', and at the end of the day he flicked the switch. The honourable member for Goldstein was not good copy; he just did not go over on the radio because he had nothing-5,000 documents, came in with a truckload, fingered through them; it must have taken him weeks to do that. What an awful waste of the resources, intellect, time and energy of the honourable member for Goldstein. It proved absolutely nothing and did nothing, except to blacken the names of a lot of good students under the ELICOS and under the auspices of other schemes. Incidentally, those students earn this economy a great deal of money-I believe somewhere in the vicinity of $370m a year; it could be somewhat nearer to $500m in the next couple of years, while the wider economic implications are nearer $1 billion. Which honour- able members on the other side of the House even thought that this country could make education into an export industry? It had never been heard of before; the Minister, who is to be congratulated for it, not only had the idea in mind but also put it into practice, earning hard dollars for this country. We have good academics in this country; we have good teachers in this country; and we have a great contribution to make to those students in Asia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, together with its companion Bills, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1991-92 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1991-92, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1991 to 30 November 1991, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills which will form part of the Budget for 1991-92 will be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $12,062m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $1,364m, or about 12.75 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase reflects a combination of factors including:</PARA>
<PARA> * price and cost increases and the impact of exchange rate variations;</PARA>
<PARA> * the inclusion of those ordinary annual services of government items which appeared in the Supply Bill (No. 2) in 1990-91 because they had not previously been included in the annual Appropriation Bills; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the full year effect of new and enhanced programs which have commenced since the introduction of the previous Supply Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA> Examples of these increases include:</PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-General's</PARA>
<PARA> * $26m for the first full year of operations of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Community Services and Health</PARA>
<PARA> * $33m for residential care for older people principally from an increase in construction activity reflecting increased approvals on previous years of capital grants for construction of aged person nursing homes and hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> * $120m for services for families with children as a result of the 1990-91 Budget policy changes, enhancements to child-care relief and changes to the payment cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>Veterans' Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> * $38m for other services reflecting a large increase in the demand for medical and hospital services for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence</PARA>
<PARA> * $288m for equipment and stores flowing from increased payments for approved projects coming on-stream and greater activity levels for existing equipment projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment, Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA> * $107m for special employment, education and income support reflecting growth in student assistance programs, including student numbers, indexation of benefits and an additional payment in the Supply period in 1991-92 compared to 1990-91, as well as new measures-namely, implementation of the Active Employment Strategy in Jobtrain and the 12 March initiatives in the new enterprise incentive scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> * $28m to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, largely reflecting the significant growth in Aboriginal programs between 1989-90 and 1990-91 on which the Supply estimates for the two years were based. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry, Technology and Commerce</PARA>
<PARA> * $142m for other services with the $143m increased provision for national interest payments by the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Wheat Board in respect of Iraqi wheat debt default partially offset by net reductions in other items. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Security</PARA>
<PARA> * $69m for running costs, which includes provision for payments to the Australian Valuations Office and the Australian Government Health Service for which there was no Supply provision in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasury</PARA>
<PARA> * $56m for Australian Bureau of Statistics running costs largely as a supplementation to take account of the peak in outlays in August 1991 associated with the 1991 census of population and housing. </PARA>
<PARA> * $47m for Australian Taxation Office running costs largely reflecting anticipated expenditure on the modernisation project, increased funding for the Child Support Agency and some `one-off' payments anticipated in the first half of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1991-92 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The amount sought is $500m, or about 17.1 per cent, more than that provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1990-91. Of this figure only about $50m is as a consequence of new initiatives not previously included in the annual Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The residual flows largely from lumpy payments associated with existing programs which have previously been approved by the Parliament. Major increases in existing subdivisions include:</PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Services-</PARA>
<PARA> $54m for payment to the Department of Administrative Services common service trust accounts to fund approved acquisition programs and to provide additional working capital as these agencies move to a more commercial operating base. </PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industries and Energy-</PARA>
<PARA> $47m for payments to or for the States and Territories principally as a result of payments to Victoria in lieu of royalties following revised petroleum taxation arrangements. This increase has been partially been offset by variations in the timing of other payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasury-</PARA>
<PARA> $108m for payments to the States and Territories largely as assistance for debt redemption. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of new provisions which reflect new Government initiatives, these have been separately itemised in the Bill, in accordance with longstanding convention, and include:</PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-General's-</PARA>
<PARA> $5.9m for advances, establishment grants, payments and operating subsidy for the Auscript-Commonwealth Reporting Service Trust Account-as the Commonwealth Reporting Service is moving to a trust account as part of its commercialisation arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill has been introduced for the sole purpose of fixing up a problem, which is entirely of the Government's own making, in relation to fees paid under Medicare for various pathology services. The background to this dates back some six or seven years, to a time when automation of various pathology tests was being performed. These relate particularly to so-called ELISA tests-a type of assay which is performed by a number of pathologists-which are enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. They are a nice, easy and very effective assay to automate. It transpired, quite correctly, that a number of pathologists were using the automated system but were still receiving an older-type fee, which was appropriate for a non-automated system but not for the new ELISA tests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, quite reasonably, determined that as the test was easier and faster to do-it usually takes a few minutes, as opposed to a few hours-it would amend the medical benefits schedule and lower the rebate paid for those particular tests. They cover a range of similar tests. The determination was based upon advice given subsequently by the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee and by the Pathology Services Advisory Committee. I understand that their advice has to be based upon some 10 pages or more of principles; understandably, therefore, sometimes those principles are not entirely followed. It seems that this was the common problem in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognised that there was a problem and in 1987 tried to fix it. In essence, it is trying to introduce some reduction in fees for these particular tests. The range which it now wants to introduce is of the order of $12 to $17 for the first test. If these tests are not covered by any particular item number, it falls back into a catch-all item, No. 1345-which is an old number which was deleted some four or five years ago-for which the rebate was of the order of $34.50. This was never really intended to cover the ELISA test, but it is the catch-all test. It was intended to be used for tests measuring a range of different items, including arsenic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was aware that there was a problem. It did try to fix it; but it tried to fix it inappropriately. In 1988 there was a court case involving Queensland Medical Laboratories in which, on a technicality based upon the fact that the advisory committees had not actually followed the appropriate prescribed principles, it was decided that the new item numbers were invalid and, therefore, any fees claimed should be paid under old item number, 1345. That was a case taken on a general basis. As a result of that, in 1989 a particular Queensland pathologist, Dr Richard Peverill, took out a court case against the Health Insurance Commission effectively claiming back payment for a number of these ELISA tests. He was successful, having exploited the technicality which was there, and he either has been paid or is about to be paid a total of $1.7m. That is $1.7m of taxpayers' money, which I am sure could be put to much better use than going into the pocket of a Queensland pathologist. </PARA>
<PARA> If this loophole or technicality is not corrected, I understand that the same pathologist has outstanding claims which may amount to some $7m. If the course is pursued by pathologists across Australia, a total liability may amount to some $100m. That is $100m of taxpayers' funds, as I pointed out, which could very well be used either in other areas in the Health portfolio or in a number of other portfolios, much better than going into the back pockets of a number of other private pathologists. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the pathologist concerned has exploited a technicality. He obviously has the law on his side. The question which arises is: who is at fault? Is it the pathologist or is it the Government? I am sure that the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) will use his usual anti-doctor rhetoric and blame the whole thing on the pathologist involved. I guess that to some extent there is some justification for that. I have no sympathy for the pathologist in this matter. But clearly, the problem is a Government problem. It is due to the incompetence of the Government, in the first place, in terms of the advice it received and the way the determination was arrived at. It is due to the incompetence of the Government, in the second place, in not fixing it in 1987, and also the delay from the original court case involving Queensland Medical Laboratories in 1988-when it must have realised there was a problem which needed fixing-up to now, 1991, which is three years in which virtually nothing has been done. As a result of that three-year delay, the taxpayers are shelling out $1.7m to a private individual. The whole pathology profession agrees with the position of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Opposition agrees with the position of the Government. We supported the initial changes when they came in four or five years ago, and we support them now. Clearly, where a test or a procedure becomes automated or easier to do, then it is appropriate to lower the fees so long as the other changes involved are taken into account. So we have no problem with the fees which are going to be charged under these new item numbers, 2294 and 2295, and we support those. Clearly the professional bodies have taken a view that this is appropriate not only because of the Government's desires but also because of their own desires. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint letter from the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal Australian College of Pathologists says that they actively support the measure, since the result of the legislation not going through would be detrimental not only to the Government but also to the profession. They point out that the profession has no difficulty with the legislation, which legitimises what almost everybody was doing-with the exception of one or two individuals whom I have already named. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid I have to be critical about the Government's attitude to the whole matter. In the first place there seems to be incompetence and, in the second place, ineptitude. It was drawn to the previous Minister's attention some four years ago. It went through the Queensland Supreme Court in 1988. There was another court case in 1989 with Dr Peverill being successful in his action. I do not honestly see how the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) can defend such procrastination. I accept that he was not the Minister at that time, but his pre- decessor was running the Department at that time, and I am sure he has had a few words with a few people with regard to their incompetence on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all pathologists would agree with the intent of the legislation as it was originally enacted, and this legislation corrects the problem. What is happening is that we are helping to bail out the Government yet again and save the taxpayers a whole lot of money. In the first place, that $1.7m has gone, and I understand-the Minister might give us some up-to-date information on this-that it is not possible to regain that $1.7m, some of which has been paid and part of which I gather is about to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things we have to ask is exactly what the Government was doing throughout this whole period. In the end it seems to be a relatively straightforward procedure to fix the matter, so why was it not fixed earlier? Clearly, all the pathologists knew about it. The court case in 1988 received very wide publicity and was a major defeat for the Government. Not only did the pathologists know, but I presume the Department knew. I would be surprised if it did not-I would be more than surprised; I would be appalled if it did not-so presumably, therefore, the relevant Minister and his advisers at the time knew. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the Government doing? Hoping it would go away? Hoping that the pathologists involved would decline a gift of $8.7m in total? That is a lot of money to decline. One has to be very altruistic to give away that amount of money. We do support this legislation and we will help to bail the Government out of this mess, mainly because it will save the taxpayers' money, but we have to be very critical indeed of the procedures which the Government has pursued up to this time. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a number of other outstanding problems in this area which the Government has not fixed with this particular legislation. The Government's own report a few weeks ago pointed out the difficulties of overservicing and overusage in general but, in particular, the Minister made the point in a debate which we had with Paul Lyneham-a debate which I might add never went to air; I think the Gulf crisis overtook us both, perhaps because we were more boring than the Gulf crisis, which I think is probably fair comment-that the main problems were in secondary referrals in pathology items in particular, and the increase in overuse and overservicing in that area has been very significant. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures indicate that the number of services between 1984-85 and 1989-90 in this area have increased by some 20.6 per cent overall. The percentage of services bulkbilled over that period increased from 43 per cent to 59 per cent. If we look at it in numerical terms, the number of services bulkbilled increased by 65 per cent, comparing 1984-85 with 1989-90. That is a very sizeable increase due to bulkbilling. There are rumours around, and anecdotes galore, that the main problem with overuse and overservicing is in the so-called 24-hour-although many of them are no longer 24-hour-bulkbilling clinics where because revenue is important to the clinics it is important not only that people be referred to pathology services but also be seen subsequently for another item number. </PARA>
<PARA> In case the Government wonders how much we are talking about, according to the last figures I have pathology services amounted to some $550m a year. We are not talking peanuts. We are talking about overservicing on a big scale, both in terms of percentages and, more importantly, in terms of money. There is a lot of hard cash there. We are concerned about $1.7m going in this particular item here, but we have also $550m going in pathology items, a sizeable number of which are overused or misused, or overserviced, and the Government is not doing anything to redress that. It is a golden opportunity to resolve some of these problems. It is very clear they have been going on for a number of years. It is very clear there are a number of different factors involved, of which bulkbilling may be one of the most significant although it is by no means the only one. It is very important that we do attack these things. Bulkbilling should not necessarily be a sacred cow. If it is a sacred cow, it is about time the Government looked at whether it needed a bit of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government very correctly-we supported it-in the last Budget introduced price signals for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). It was not a popular decision, and I understand it caused the Government some difficulties. It was not an easy decision for us to support, but it was the right decision and price signals are important here. To a certain extent it does not matter if in the end the whole price is rebatable from either Medicare or private insurance, whichever is appropriate; the important thing is that there is a price signal there. The patient sees a bill, and we get rid of this misconception that the services are free. They are clearly not free in any stretch of anybody's imagination; they are paid for by the taxpayer in the end. It was very important that some price signal be introduced into the PBS, and the Government did the right thing. The Government introduced it and used a reasonably satisfactory way of resolving some of the problems faced by the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government knows, we supported it on that issue, but the Government cannot bite the bullet here and say that price signals are needed in the Medicare area. One of the problems with bulkbilling is that it does relate, without any doubt at all, to overservicing. As I say, it is not the only cause but it is one issue which the Government can address and should address. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of other areas of misuse in the Medicare system, some of which were passed on to me only this week. For example, Dr Lewis, a well-known physician in my electorate, had a 57-year-old patient who came to see him last week-a Vietnamese gentleman who had arrived in Australia only two weeks prior to coming to see Dr Lewis. Within a fortnight of his arrival in Australia he was admitted to Bankstown hospital and was diagnosed as suffering severe mixed mitral disease. As I am sure the Minister knows, one does not get this disease overnight. It is not an acute illness; it is a long term disease. It is a chronic disease usually based upon a history of rheumatic fever in childhood. </PARA>
<PARA> It turns out that the patient had been here for only a very short time and yet he had already received a Medicare card. It is not clear what sort of visa he was on, and I am not clear whether the problem is one of the Department giving a card inappropriately or whether it is a problem of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs not screening an individual before he came to Australia and seeing whether in fact there was a medical condition which may well have precluded him from coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> He has been in hospital now for approximately a month and the cost of his treatment obviously will run into tens of thousands of dollars by the time it is finished. There is a major problem with this particular issue and I think this is one example of something which needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> This happened also with a Dr Zipser from Kempsey, who phoned me about a patient who came in the other day. He had a Medicare card and offered it. It so happened that the Medicare card was not in the same name that he had given to the doctor. The doctor's receptionist said, `This is the wrong name', whereupon the patient drew out a wallet of six Medicare cards and said, `Take your pick'. I understand the Minister is about to reissue some of the Medicare cards, and he has accepted there are problems with those, so I will not pursue that any further other than to say it is a widespread problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, there was a problem with a lady from Melbourne who went into a local Medicare office. She was told-rightly or wrongly-there was no money to pay her. She went to the Medicare office in early February and was eventually paid in March. When she asked why there was no processing for her claim she was told, firstly, that cheques are not processed-clearly that is inappropriate-and also that there was no money to pay her. The doctor had only charged the scheduled fee, so there was no particular problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA> A doctor-again from my own electorate-phoned me the other day and spoke to me about a young lady who had been in Australia for 25 days. She was 24 weeks pregnant, and the state of her visa is not clear to us. She was about to fly back to Belgium. She returned, having been in Australia for 25 days. As far as we can tell, she was not a permanent resident of Australia but we do not have confirmation of that. She said she had decided she would like to have the baby in Australia. I can understand that; it is quite a nice place to have a baby, particularly since the baby would have Australian citizenship. What greater gift can one bestow upon one's child? When she came back two weeks later, having been in Australia for some 25 days, apparently as a visitor-I do not have confirmation of that-she had not only her Medicare card but also a pension card. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; She had both a Medicare card and a pension card. I have the numbers here. I will not read them into Hansard, but I will pass them on to the Minister so that he can investigate what is going on. This seems to be a rather strange case. She has now had that baby at a cost to the Australian taxpayer, but at no cost to the Belgian taxpayer. I understand that there is no reciprocal agreement with the Belgian authorities in terms of health benefits. It does seem rather difficult to explain exactly why the taxpayer is funding that particular problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also had a letter from an old friend of mine, Dr Alice Glover. The Minister may know her because she worked in his Department; he may have heard of her. She was a ray of brightness amongst a sea of mediocrity in many aspects of the Minister's Department. She worked for the therapeutic goods administration, so I am sure he will understand what I mean. While she was there I probably experienced the best relationships between outside practitioners in terms of getting commonsense decisions about approvals for new drugs, which was her particular area of expertise. She was responsible for that. Since she left a few years ago the situation has reverted to its previous disastrous incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Glover has now gone into general practice. I think she went into general practice because she was so frustrated with the bureaucracy. She pointed out in her letter that she had sadly exchanged one bureaucracy with another. The main problem she had with her new general practice was having to deal with her previous employers. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention a particular case of a patient who is referred to as John B. He is fiftyish and has a terminal illness, a rare progressive neurological disease. He was in hospital for a couple of admissions and was eventually discharged to a nursing home because Dr Glover agreed to undertake his care and to see him on a regular basis, even though the nursing home was some distance away from her practice. She agreed, bearing in mind and understanding that it would involve some sacrifice from her and some personal cost, but Alice Glover is a very caring, very involved person who puts looking after her patients far ahead of looking after her bank balance. </PARA>
<PARA> John was doubly incontinent; he could not speak properly-he was totally dysarthric; and he was fed through a gastrostomy tube going straight through the abdominal wall into his stomach because he could not swallow. He was able to understand what was going on even though he was locked in by his disabilities. He was not able to tell the nurses what he wanted or to take any action to improve his existence; indeed, it was a very difficult existence for him. Dr Glover made many trips. On one particular trip she spent approximately an hour communicating with him and his nursing staff and organising his treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The normal fee for such a visit is $24.65, but there is provision in the schedules for a consultation of `unusual length or complexity'. I am not sure how on earth anybody could take any view other than that this was a consultation, firstly, of unusual length and, secondly, in view of his very complicated history, of great complexity. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Glover wrote to the Health Insurance Commission asking to be reimbursed under the definition of `unusual length or complexity'-I think it is item 65, if I remember rightly-for which the fee is an astronomical $56. She received a letter back effectively saying that she had to be joking and that in this situation nothing would happen. She points out that she is actually saving the community enormous sums of money because if she were not prepared to look after John in a nursing home he would have to be in an acute category hospital bed, which costs hundreds of dollars per day. Yet she has to look after him for a rate barely comparable to that given to a plumber who would call at the same nursing home to fix a blocked drain. </PARA>

We have helped to bail the Government out of a difficult corner in the interests of the taxpayer. We believe that is the appropriate way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sadly, there is a whole range of other issues-I have touched upon a very few-which have not been addressed in the slightest. The Minister will turn around, as he always does-he will use the same excuse he used when he was the social security Minister-and say, `But we have the Cass review; now we have the national health strategy'. That is a wonderful excuse and I understand his grabbing that straw not to make any decisions. We look forward to the health strategy results and some recommendations from that process. It will be very interesting to see which way he goes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of nettles here that the Minister has to grasp. Sadly, while he is delaying, those nettles are getting more and more poisonous, not just to him but, more particularly, to the Australian community.

He mentioned that the cost to revenue is currently about $550m in the pathology area. I think I agree with him. In that area there is a lot of overservicing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was listening; I have my notes here. That is exactly what the honourable member said. He also went on to talk about price signals. He referred to the $2.50 that was imposed this year on people receiving the pension. Price signals are fine if we want to control things such as pharmaceuticals, but what about medical services? If the Opposition wants a price signal to stop people using medical services it has to ask: who is being disadvantaged by that? Are people on incomes such as ours put off if they have to pay an up-front fee of $10, or is it people like pensioners, people on low incomes or young families with young kids who really are struggling to make ends meet? Are they the sort of people who respond to price signals in exactly the same way as we do? Of course, they are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member's argument is sterile and so predictable. One only has to pick up any magazine, such as Australian Medicine, which I will refer to a little later, to know exactly what members of the Opposition are up to. The honourable member talks about price signals. We are talking about health services; we are not talking about some market-oriented service or provision of goods industry. The honourable member touched very briefly on bulkbilling. Although he did not elaborate, I got the impression that he sees bulkbilling as some sort of evil and wants to get rid of it. I do not know whether he has spoken to many people out on the streets about bulkbilling, especially those who go to doctors who bulkbill. Consumers think that bulkbilling is a good idea. The simple fact is that many doctors do too. A lot more bulkbilling is happening. As every year goes by the bulkbilling level rises, in spite of what apologists for the Australian Medical Association (AMA) might say about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about a Vietnamese patient in Australia, which I found very interesting. He might be right in what he said about the health check. This man got a Medicare card and is receiving the treatment. What sort of treatment could he expect under the honourable member's proposal when he gets it? Would he be on the health voucher? We do not know. Why should these people not get medical treatment if they are permanent residents of Australia? The rest of what the honourable member had to say, apart from that about Dr Glover, is not worth answering. I will come back to Dr Glover a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Just before the honourable member sat down, he got on to the national health strategy and disparaged the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) for using this as an excuse for not doing anything. The national health strategy will allow input from all parties into an area of great importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has been operating now since 1984 and it is entirely right that we should have a national health strategy and that we should put our position papers that are being distributed throughout the community at present to allow people in the medical profession, people who represent patients and all other associated groups, such as political parties, to have their say about how we can improve the areas involved in delivering health services. Page 2 of Australian Medicine of 4 February 1991, which the AMA kindly sent to me, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In an unprecedented move, the Presidents of the 15 Medical Colleges and the AMA have agreed to a joint approach to the Federal Government's National Health Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>It says `a joint approach' as though there is some sort of threat out there and we have to circle the wagons and get everybody together. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The combined weight of the political and academic arms of the profession will provide a voice to the Medicare review that the Government will have difficulty ignoring. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members can see there the sort of mentality that is starting to fester in relation to what the national health strategy is all about. Instead of taking it for what it is, there is a defensive mechanism. But the best is yet to come. On page 3, the article talks about `The Seven Principles'. There are seven principles that these bodies have said that they are going to stick to, and basically I have no disagreement with them. The first six are motherhood statements; nobody could disagree. But No. 7 is a very interesting one. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Civil rights and liberties must be assured. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes straight up to the high ground. It goes on in point form. The first point says:</PARA>
<PARA>Patients must be free to choose their own personal doctors. </PARA>
<PARA>Why are they not now?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Bob Woods" NAMEID="1K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr Bob Woods</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because you legislated against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are not against it. There is nothing to stop any medical practitioner in Australia from treating either a Medicare patient or a private patient on equal terms. There is nothing in legislation to prevent it. There is nothing to stop any doctor from treating any patient. In fact, in their surgeries, they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But restrictions are being placed on certain access to certain medical services by the medical profession. The area of private hospitals is one. The Medicare agreement, at 4.4, allows for Medicare patients to be treated in private hospitals. But who bars it? It is the medical profession; a barrier exists only because it has been put there by sections of the medical profession. I should not say that all of them bar it. As is the case with the Bill before the House today, the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill, it is only a minority of the total profession who engage in these sorts of restrictive practices. </PARA>
<PARA> But the next point in the article is a lulu and takes a lot of beating. No wonder it is buried right down at the bottom of the page. Again under `Civil rights and liberties must be assured', the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>Patients as consumers of medical services, must be free to negotiate with doctors on the price of medical services provided. </PARA>
<PARA>How would you be? Right down at the bottom of these seven wonderful principles we come to the nub of the whole thing-that is, the freedom, as they see it, of those in the medical profession to set their own fees irrespective of the capacity of the patient to pay those fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come back to that a little later. Do honourable members think that patients want that or that people in the community want to be able to go up to the doctor or medical practitioner who may be operating on them and say, `I really want to negotiate the fee that you are going to charge me before you operate'? Can honourable members imagine anyone being so dumb as to haggle with a surgeon or a medical specialist just before they are going into hospital to have that medical specialist or surgeon operate on them? Why should they have to, but why would they want to? Yet this is enshrined as one of the seven principles under the heading `Civil rights and liberties'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) may shake his head; but he used to be in it. We would expect that of him as the defender of the AMA. Even under the current system, where they can do this, a section of medical practitioners put out a little statement when they send out their accounts. I refer to a statement from an obstetrician who sends it out with every account. He says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the Government's action in taking away by law patients' rights to full insurance cover against medical costs, patients themselves are now responsible for payment of the substantial gap which exists between the government-permitted refund amounts (Medicare and Private Insurance) and surgical fees. </PARA>
<PARA>This obstetrician is saying that the naughty Government is stopping patients from insuring for anything above the schedule fee. That is totally dishonest. Yet that statement is enclosed with all the accounts this gynaecologist sends out. It is an outright lie. That is the sort of thing we are dealing with and that is the sort of thing that happens when patients have the freedom to choose to pay whatever the surgeon tells them to pay when they go to receive their medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Remember that the patients are the people who pay the bill. It is a master-servant relationship and the patient is the person paying the bill. If honourable members were sitting down to design a medical insurance scheme that favoured the patients, whereby patients would be looked after, they would not choose to let the patient deal directly with the doctor about what the level of the fee should be. The reason people would not do that is that there is no way of knowing what a fair and reasonable fee is. Nobody in the community, I would venture to say, apart from people who have an active interest in that area, would know how to negotiate with a medical practitioner on a fair and reasonable fee for any operation-appendix or any other operation honourable members might like to think of. How would a person in the street know what was a fair and reasonable fee? How could people negotiate on fair and equal terms? The simple fact is that they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if members of the AMA are against setting fees for medical services. They have their own set of fees. They are not against the principle of setting fees; they are against the principle of allowing either patients or patients' representatives to have a say in helping them set the fees. That is why for some time I have been advocating collectively set fees, whereby the medical profession and representatives of consumer organisations who have an expertise in this area sit down and negotiate collectively the schedule fees which should apply. If there is any difference between the parties, they can arbitrate. Once those fees are set, they should not be exceeded. That will be the whole nub of health insurance when we come down to it, and it is enshrined in these wonderful lofty principles right down at the bottom of the page where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Patients as consumers of medical services, must be free to negotiate with doctors on the price of medical services provided. </PARA>
<PARA>I reject that. I think that patients would be much better served by having those fees collectively set so that members of the medical profession get a fair and reasonable fee, as they should, for the services they provide. If we use a system such as that, it is entirely possible that we can make it a lot more attractive for some members of the medical profession to go out of our capital cities. We could put in differentials to recognise the fact that it costs more to run a practice in a remote location than it does in the city. We can build it into a system like that. But the best advantage of it is the fact that people do not have to pay out of their own pocket what are huge sums of money in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Another letter sent out by a different doctor recognises the fact that in some cases his fees financially hurt the patient who is seeing him. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Please do not hesitate to discuss with me, or my staff, any difficulties in understanding or meeting an account, as I value your goodwill and I will do everything possible to assist you. If you need to budget for your confinement please contact my rooms early in the pregnancy for details of current fees. </PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. There is a recognition out there that some of the fees being charged by a minority of the medical profession are financially crippling Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Just recently in the House I spoke about a scheme operating in Perth whereby Medicare patients could have access to treatment and operations in private hospitals if they put their houses up as collateral. At the time I pointed out that there is nothing to stop Medicare treating those patients in private hospitals. But once again, we cannot get a section of the medical profession to treat Medicare patients in private hospitals. There is no medical and no administrative reason why they cannot be treated in private hospitals, but the doctor-dollar relationship comes between them and their treatment. That is what it is all about. That is why, once fees are collectively set and adhered to, people have a chance of getting access to medical treatment on equal terms. But whenever there are two classes of patients-where privately insured patients can, in some cases, be charged excessively; certainly in excess of the scheduled fee in all cases-then access to medical services is uneven. In many cases, access to medical services is based on ability to pay rather than need. </PARA>
<PARA> We never heard the shadow spokesman talk about anything like that. Time and time again he comes in here with little stories that doctors send to him. That is all he does. The one thing that we can always be sure of is that neither from the current shadow spokesman nor from the previous shadow spokesman, to whom he is now talking, will we ever get an inkling of what they would do. Throughout his speech the shadow spokesman said, `This needs addressing. That needs addressing. You should look at this'. Why does he not look at it? Why does he not come up with a few solutions? The simple fact is that the only thing that we know about his policy is, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, health vouchers: `There is a good idea; we will go with health vouchers'. But apart from that little glimmer of light through the darkness from the Opposition side in over a year, since the honourable member has been spokesman, we have heard nothing. It is not good enough that he put it to the Minister to come up with answers. In actual fact, the Minister will. If the shadow spokesman really wants answers the best thing he can do is to stay in opposition. The one thing that we can be sure of is that, if those opposite were to come to this side of the House, they would be run by the AMA, as they have always been. Because of their history, the one thing that we can be sure of is that Medicare will be dismantled in exactly the same way as Medibank was. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to a case that the shadow spokesman brought up. I think that he has a case with Dr Glover. There may well be instances in which the Medicare schedule does not properly remunerate doctors for the services they provide. But under the scheme of collectively negotiated schedule fees, that would be addressed. The medical profession could put its cards on the table and say, `This is really what it costs us to deliver that service', but it does not do that. It chooses to have the AMA fees, hit the patient with a fairly hefty bill, and then try to collect it. I am sure that the patient described by the Opposition spokesman may not have been in a position to pay it and, therefore, would not have been pushed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that patients came first when setting these Medicare schedule fees and, first, that patients be protected from having to go and negotiate with their doctors on unequal terms; secondly, that the medical profession be adequately rewarded for the services it provides; and, thirdly, that access to medical services be based not on ability to pay but on equality of access. And the only way to do that is with collectively negotiated schedule fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the national health strategy announced by the Minister and alluded to by the shadow spokesman is the vehicle by which all of those views can be put. If the Opposition has a view, that also should be put. In the end, all the views expressed in the national health strategy, such as the one now under way, will be taken into account. But certainly, under this Government at least, the patient, not the doctors, will be the central focus of that national health strategy. I am sure that out of the process we will arrive at not only a better health insurance system but also a much better strategy to look at many of the pressing problems alluded to in previous debates. It seems that the area of preventive medicine and a number of other areas need addressing. This can be done only with a comprehensive review. This stands in stark contrast with what the Opposition has either proposed or done in the past. In the last eight years we have had six or seven health policies from those opposite. It is about time they got their act together and started contributing positively to what is a very important debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) seems to like to get up on these debates. Of course, over time he has become known as the principal doctor basher of Australia. That is unfortunate but it is a fact of life that he would like some unconstitutional legislation passed in this place to conscript doctors and get all of them on the government payroll. When that is achieved we will have no problem with overservicing; we will have the problem of underservicing only. The doctors will say, `Righto, you pay me so much a year, I will see X number of patients and, when my eight-hour or five-hour shift or whatever is up, I go home'. Of course, that is not the way that the Opposition perceives the delivery of health services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that always escapes the honourable member for Canning and, unfortunately, the Government is that there are two components of health: one is the delivery of health services and the other is the very clear welfare responsibility of governments.

One of two Ministers of the Burke Government-it was either Hodge or Pearce-gave an interview to a journalist. This was reported in the paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fine; I do not object to that. But I am talking about health and I am giving an example to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) of how people believed that government could run business and, with due respect, that includes health services. They believed that they could run it better than could private enterprise. In this case, they lost half their fingers on the first handshake; and they were the honest ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am surprised at the sensitivity of the Minister. I thought that he was one of those who were not too happy with some of these donations. We will get away from that. But I really thought the Minister was upset about what had been going on in the last few days and what went on in Perth some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that the delivery of health services is not an area for government activity-it never was and it has been a disaster whenever governments have tried it. The Opposition realises this. It is a pity that the Minister will not listen. He might be making a genuine attempt. I am grateful for his attendance. That is more than his predecessor did on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am here to point out a few facts to the Minister that need not be critical. By the way, in his response, I would welcome his enlightening me and the Parliament as to how my constituents who are in the public hospital queue can go to a private hospital and have Medicare pay their hospital bill. I do not know how that works but, boy, I would want to get a press release out this afternoon if that were the case because I know many people urgently needing so-called elective surgery who would be delighted to go to a private hospital if Medicare, as the honourable member for Canning has implied, would pay their bill. We are well aware of their right to go but, as the Government is at pains to tell us from time to time, well over 50 per cent of people today are not privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to be noted is that the honourable member for Canning was trying to throw up a smokescreen with those remarks. Secondly, the Minister had better tell us now, seeing as his expert on doctor bashing has told us that it is all the fault of the doctors that people do not go to private hospitals to get urgent medical treatment, how that can be managed and paid for by Medicare. Of course, as we also know, under the legislation that this Bill seeks to amend, people who go to a private hospital and are privately insured still cannot get full cover. The Government prevents their getting adequate cover to pay the full cost of going to a private hospital. So the privately insured are deserting private health insurance in droves, if only because they see themselves as being disadvantaged in terms of cost because they have private insurance. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canning made reference to the restrictive practices of doctors. One thing about doctors is that, provided one is privately insured, one can have some choice under Medicare in terms of a consultation. I recollect that the honourable member for Canning had some trade union involvement prior to his coming to this place. There is not much choice in terms of the labour practices of a lot of trade unions; they do not believe in choice. Workers are told that they will do as they are told-no ticket, no start. Of course, they continue to subscribe to the most tragic of all circumstances, which even the Treasurer (Mr Keating) criticised today-that nobody is worth more for his efforts than another. Of course, that is not true. When we take that away, particularly in a field such as medicine where excellence is so important, standards decline overnight. Of course, somebody who is better and perceived in the community to be better than others should be able to charge more for his services; that is his or her reward for being better. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded again of the trade union area. It is interesting to note that shearers, notwithstanding that they were the first people to be unionised, still do piece work. They are still highly competitive on the board. They want to be better than their mates and they get rewarded for it. Surely it is time that Australia woke up to the fact that, whether it be in the delivery of health services or in the delivery of manufacturing, financial incentive is the most practical way of achieving productivity and improved standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is all about the lowest common denominator. Of course, the legislation before us is just another example of how legislation fails. Unfortunately, it is all about numbers. The legislation is here to correct the fact that, notwithstanding an agreement with the profession as to payment, the legislation created an entirely different situation and has caused the Government huge embarrassment because somebody has been able to apply and win in court on achieving payments that I think everyone would now accept were in excess of what was reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of all this is probably in the honourable member for Canning's remark that people are now having to put their houses up as collateral to get an operation. He wanted to paint that as some problem created by doctors. Why is this happening? It is happening because some people trusted the Minister and his predecessor's rhetoric which said, `When you are sick and you need an operation to overcome pain, suffering and blindness, we will deliver; we will provide that operation immediately'. But, of course, the Government has since discovered the runaway cost of its very generous universal scheme. What now? The only effective method of controlling costs that it has so far discovered is rationing. It is rationing the services and when some people who trusted its word--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those fools-the poor people who trusted the Government and its rhetoric-when they can suffer the pain no more or get fed up with tripping over things because they cannot see because of cataracts, go and mortgage their houses. They do it because they have been conned into believing that they need not insure privately because the Government will provide all-and the Government has been found wanting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened in terms of the budget. When the Liberal Party of Australia left office people paid, I think, nothing for a prescription-I will stand corrected if that was not the case; but it was minimal. Pensioners certainly did not pay anything. All that has escalated since Medicare because of the Government's inability to control costs. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time that this Government introduced Medicare, in round figures government expenditure was $3 billion on health, $3 billion on education and $3 billion on defence. They were in the top five big ticket items. If the Minister has consulted recently, he might be aware that we are now spending about $7 billion on education, $7 billion on defence and over $13 billion on health. Were the Minister able to get up and say that that had all been successful and that people are getting a super-duper service relative to that expenditure, I guess he might have an argument. But the simple fact is that people are now waiting two years and are still being told fibs about the reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canning wants to blame the medical profession. The Government wants to blame all sorts of other things. If it were as honest as the New Zealanders it would state the real reason. During the time that I was shadow Minister for health I attended a conference at which the keynote speaker was Dame Dorothy Fraser, a highly regarded medical public hospital administrator in New Zealand who had just been one of a number of members on a government inquiry looking at the New Zealand public hospital system. I happen to have her written speech still. She said words almost exactly to this effect: `We have 50,000 people on public hospital waiting lists in New Zealand and waiting lists are the means by which we ration public hospital services'. She was honest. She told us what the purpose of waiting lists was. She then went on quite properly to complain about the administration of waiting lists and to point out that, if one is in the know, if one is aggressive, wealthy or a well-known politician or other important person, it is very simple to queue-jump. In fact, she said that sometimes it is not even necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister that, if he or one of the members of his family known to the medical profession were to become very ill tonight, without any interference from him he or she would get special treatment under Medicare. That is inherent in the system. Dame Dorothy Fraser complained about that. She said that that was wrong, and I agree with her. But it is just another component--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other day we had an economist talk about vouchers. `Vouchers' is a lovely word. It has been built up by certain interest groups to be something dreadful. I have a definition of `vouchers'. To me, `voucher' says: fund people, not institutions. The honourable member for Canning actually remembered people in his speech when he said that we should not be ruled by the Australian Medical Association, the patients should come first. I wish that people on the other side of the chamber could understand that patients come first. Just as in the wool debate and in the wheat debate, the situation inevitably arrives where the institutions come first. We had a wool debate not about whether the reserve price scheme had failed, but about whether the Australian Wool Corporation should survive. Because of this Government's rhetoric and its commitment in previous elections, the issue is not whether people are well served by Medicare but whether it should survive, whether it should continue. There are a heck of a lot of bureaucrats pushing that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has chosen to interject: if all of his elderly constituents had an increase in their pensions sufficient to allow them to buy private health insurance, would they or would they not be better off? They would have immediate access to private hospitals if they had private health insurance. If someone wants to know what that increase in the pension is: it is a voucher. That is all it is. It is a voucher service. As I said, `voucher' has become an ugly word; but that is what it means. Would the honourable member for Chifley object to that? If he does, he should stand up and say, `I am so much a socialist that I would not try to raise the pension level for pensioners sufficient to allow them to buy their own private health insurance and have immediate access to the total system'. I would like to hear him say that and put it on the record. He has wanted to criticise vouchers in a simple form. That is what `vouchers' means. It is an interesting point. I am quite happy to say it. </PARA>
<PARA> When I did that calculation some years ago and I applied the same principle to the family allowance and I applied the same principle of a subsidy to elderly people, I found that it was $3,000m cheaper than the cost of the Government's providing a universal medical service to the whole of Australia at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The great problem with what the Government has attempted is that it is more interested in creating an institution than in looking after the needy. The best way to look after the needy is to reserve capital and to pay them the money, to give them levels of welfare sufficient to guarantee that they can personally access medical institutions and medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is losing money by trying to run the shop. Of course, in a minute the Minister will tell us that operating costs of Medicare are less than those of the typical private health insurance office. However, he will not tell us that Medicare does not collect any money; it is only in the business of paying. That is a cost not measured in the Australian Taxation Office, where all of the revenue is gained but only some is identified as a Medicare cost. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the cost to the community? I hope that the Minister does not say that it is 1.25 per cent. I hope that he has been around the Department of Community Services and Health long enough to know that is not the cost. The cost to the Federal Government is the $13-plus billion that I mentioned. That is much more than 1.25 per cent of $96,000m worth of revenue, as anybody could tell. These are the problems. The Government has a tiger by the tail because it ignored a fundamental principle of government: do not run the shop. The Government talks about selling Telecom Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd and all these organisations, and at the same time it defended to the end the service principle side of health. </PARA>

The Government took the decision, but it cannot recognise that it messed it up when it got into the business of providing health services and not just providing the financial assistance that people deserved, which would have cost a lot less. For the Minister's information, I point out that that was a policy. The Minister should not get up and speak this rubbish about lack of policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members for contributing to the debate, particularly the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) in terms of the cooperation in relation to a problem. I am not sure that I would agree with the language he used of `bailing the Government out', but it certainly was one which we felt needed to be addressed, albeit a technical problem. Nevertheless, it was one that a particular person was prepared to exploit. In terms of that problem, he was able to achieve a decision which will mean that there is a financial benefit. I think that is highly regrettable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly join with the honourable member for Lowe in acknowledging the support of the profession in relation to this amendment, not just in the sense that it now supports this action but in the sense that the profession as a whole, while being aware of possibilities since the changes in the regulations have been made, has been prepared to honour that. I think that the profession has acted honourably in this matter. That is reflected in the fact that it has very clearly indicated its position to both the Government and the Opposition. In that sense it has been prepared to recognise that it is not in its interests to have a system that is corrupt and it is not in its interests to have a system that does not operate in a way that is based on rules that are clearly understood and clearly equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to spend very much time on any other point. There are a number of issues raised by the honourable member for Lowe that I regard as serious case studies and they are matters which I can have a look at subsequent to this debate. However, I note that there has been a delay, if you like, in sorting out this issue. That does not refer so much to current practice as to how tests might have been described in the past. The fact is that the case that has been referred to opened up the possibility for exploitation in past practice. That is the particular concern of this legislative amendment. While the pathology table that was introduced in 1988 was thought to correct that defect, the advice of the Pathology Services Advisory Committee that it was a necessary precondition for making a regulation governing the rebate for this test was found invalid by the Federal Court on definitional grounds in 1988. The effect of this decision was for the rebate for this test to be determined again under the 1986 table. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1989, the industry and the Department of Community Services and Health in consultation developed a new table which went through Parliament and came into effect from 1 August 1989. This is the table that is in force now and has been valid since it came into effect. As I indicated, this Bill will make sure that pathologists can go back and claim the difference between the one invalid superseded item and a higher paying and now superseded item. Essentially, that is the point. It is not that action has not been taken, but that that loophole, once discovered or effectively established within a court setting, does open up a possibility of retrospectivity on the part of pathologists, if you like, which the Government needed to sort out or fix up. The consequence of not fixing it up potentially could have amounted to as much as $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the fact that the Government and the Opposition are at one on this particular piece of legislation and that, of course, makes it helpful. If we get disputes occurring for political reasons when the thrust of our policies is at one, then I think that is very unfortunate. I acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA> I will not go on at great length. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has indicated once again by his remarks that deep divisions exist within the Opposition. The reason we have had so many health policies from the Opposition over a period is that it is so fundamentally divided. It is divided because, on the one hand, it wants to go for a private system which is essentially based on private financing but will inevitably involve public care. The net result of such a system-whether it is a voucher system or whether there is a much greater reliance, as I think the honourable member for Lowe would have, on private insurance-is essentially to create a circumstance in which there are no effective controls. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it astounding that the honourable member for O'Connor is quite unable to conceive the fact, to realise, or to understand that a country such as the United States has a system which is heavily privatised on the financing side. This is a system which none of us in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries can really afford in terms of the overall impact on the health bill. Canada and most European countries approach health insurance in a way which recognises not the threat involved in terms of public funding and financing or Medicare-type schemes-that is, schemes of universal health insurance-but the fact that it is absolutely fundamental if they are to control costs. The great mythology that was built up in the 1970s around Medibank was that it would result in some massive explosion of costs. The experience of Medicare in the 1980s is that Medicare has enabled us to get a handle on costs and to ensure that the overall health bill remains at around 8 per cent of gross domestic product. It is very much a means of control. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that we do not need to address various problems-not so much with Medicare or financing-which arise in the health area and the health system. Both the Government and the honourable member for Lowe have referred to problems associated with the dramatic increase in demand for diagnostic services. I would not disagree with the honourable member for Lowe that such an increase in demand has occurred. I would disagree with him in the sense that it has little to do with the issue of bulkbilling. The costs associated with pathology and other diagnostic services are driven by the medical profession. They are not driven by the health consumers who are so often the scapegoats to the Opposition's approach to health. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the context of Medicare it is necessary for us to deal with issues of ballooning costs. The diagnostic area is one such area that obviously is on our agenda. As part of the national health strategy a paper will soon be released which deals specifically with pathology. We hope to get some community discussion and debate from that paper as to how the issues that go particularly to the area of pathology might be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not about having a national health strategy as some kind of smokescreen for doing nothing. It is about addressing the issues that arise out of the national health strategy in the various papers that are released and to do so as promptly as it is able. Where opportunities arise quickly following the release of papers, then I certainly will not be seeking extended delays. I believe that the success of a health strategy depends on developing some momentum so that we are able not only to identify the issues, to ventilate them and to make them transparent to the public, but also to address them where necessary by legislation or by changed policies, where changes of policy are necessary in the strategies that might be adopted by the Health Insurance Commission or might be adopted particularly by the Department as it seeks to ensure that we have a system of health in this country that is fair, efficient and able to contain costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not at all attracted to the notion that we can solve our problems of health in this country by spending more on health-by increasing that 8 per cent to 8.5 or 9 per cent or something like that. Within the overall envelope of money that we are spending on health in this country, we need to do very much better in resolving the problems without adding to the overall health bill. There are all sorts of opportunities to do that at the moment. We not only have the national health strategy, but we also have a Premiers Conference process. Functional reviews are being carried out on major portfolios, such as the health portfolio. We can talk to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always a little amused by members of the Opposition. The honourable member for O'Connor thinks he can achieve much mileage by mentioning the issue of waiting lists, as if somehow the Commonwealth Government directly administers the hospitals and is directly responsible. We are not disinterested in the issue of waiting lists. We have funded substantial amounts of money to the States for the hospital enhancement program, particularly to assist in providing options and alternatives that would have the impact of reducing waiting lists and further adding to the very considerable increases in productivity that are occurring with our hospital system-the increasing throughput. Many more patients are effectively being dealt with than ever before through our health system. The notion that somehow the Federal Government, the Commonwealth Government, can wave a magic wand over the question of waiting lists and resolve that problem is just so much nonsense. It is a complicated issue that can be dealt with only by looking at the specifics. Indeed, when we look at the specifics, we see that in many areas of discretionary surgery there is not really a problem at all. We need to look at that issue with regard to both supply and demand; we need to look at it in terms of hospital administration; and we need to look at it in terms of aspects of health financing. This is a complicated issue. Frankly, the honourable member for O'Connor does not help us very much by coming in and making his wild statements. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) indicated, fundamentally the national health strategy will be built on a concern for people. We should be able to resolve problems on the basis of those humane and sensitive values within the context of a social justice strategy, on the basis of seeking to ensure that problems of access and equity are resolved where they are problems, but not at the expense of introducing inequities which flow more from the productive side; for example, the inequities which flow from the absurd situation that we have for remuneration. In New South Wales we have levels of remuneration which are frankly unsustainable on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say one ought not to address issues of remuneration and fees for doctors, and be concerned in some areas about the levels of income for certain types of doctors. It has to be on a fair and equitable basis overall. There is no doubt in my mind that Medicare, in the context of overall concern about incomes in the community, in the 1980s made a major contribution to restraining costs in this country in terms of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA> But this particular piece of legislation is not about all those things. As the honourable member for Lowe has said, it is about fixing up a particular problem. It is one that we agree on. I commend this piece of legislation to the Parliament, and I hope that the effect of it will be to resolve a problem that has existed. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that I am anxious that we do not get a repetition of this kind of issue. I certainly will be taking up with the Department the extent to which we can get a process of legislative review which will mean that Ministers are not confronted with the situation of having to deal with problems which ought to be dealt with more speedily than this issue has been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of health I think we ought to have a strong process of review which means that we do not have to spend sometimes very large amounts of money on another profession-that is, law. By attention to detail and by a process of review we can ensure the integrity of our Budget processes and ensure that people in the various professions know that the Government is extraordinarily vigilant and willing to be fair but, at the same time, wants to be very tough so as to ensure that money does not go to people who, frankly, neither have the need nor any moral right to the money that they sometimes receive. I say that, I think, without fear of contradiction from the college and the profession. They do not have an interest in this kind of practice being allowed to develop. With those words I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak to all the elements of the legislation which comprises this cognate debate. Indeed, I think it would probably be impractical to comment on each of the matters dealt with in both pieces of legislation in the time available. I will be content in the first place to talk about the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has decided to extend the bounty on metal working machine tools and robots for a further six years, and to extend its coverage to include more products. The new scheme is to include phased reductions in the rate of bounty payments to reach 5 per cent by the middle of 1996. This reduced rate will bring the level of these bounty payments into line with the average effective rate of assistance to the rest of the manufacturing sector, excluding of course the car and textiles, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the extension of the computer bounty scheme last year, the metal working machine tool and robot bounty is to be extended following a favourable review of its operation by the Bureau of Industry Economics. The BIE assessed the effectiveness of the scheme according to a number of criteria given to it by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. These criteria included the extent to which the scheme has encouraged restructuring towards high technology manufacturing, as well as the extent to which the same scheme has helped to maintain a modern and viable metal working machines industry and has encouraged robot production. </PARA>
<PARA> The review concluded that the industry would have grown less if the assistance of the bounty scheme had not been provided by the Government. The BIE also made this claim for the computer industry and the computer bounty scheme, but I must say the significance of that is not immediately obvious. As the BIE itself concedes, the size of the industry as a whole has as much to do with cyclical demand conditions as with the operation of the bounty scheme. A larger industry may be desirable for a number of reasons, but a smaller industry might be judged even more desirable still were it to be more efficient as a result of an absence of government assistance in the form of bounties. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the BIE was inconclusive as to whether the industry, in its present form, was viable in an economic sense without continued assistance. It did note, however, that in view of reductions in assistance to other areas of manufacturing, the current level of assistance may be excessive in maintaining the industry at a viable level. Measures to keep the level of assistance to this industry in line with that given to the rest of the manufacturing sector, such as those measures contained in this Bill, are thus to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau has been forced to rely largely on evidence supplied by the manufacturers as to the effect of the bounty in encouraging restructuring towards the use of high technology and new areas of metal cutting technology. The BIE also has made a number of important reservations about the role of the bounty scheme in encouraging the development of the high technology associated with robot production. The most obvious of these, and one which applies in other industries as well, is the fact that high technology may be fostered without the benefit of domestic manufacturing activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Such technological development might be achieved simply by acquiring the relevant equipment and technology from abroad. Australia is noted more for its adaptation of foreign technology than for the manufacture of high-tech products. Thus we should not be fearful of borrowing our technology from foreigners at the expense of Australian producers, if that is where our comparative advantage lies. This is particularly true given the currently depressed state of robot manufacturing in Australia. In this connection the review notes on page 56:</PARA>
<PARA>The question as to whether the rate and direction of technological development is appropriate to Australia has not been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>This would appear to be the case for the administration of this bounty scheme. This question is only relevant, however, in the context of government holding the industry accountable for its use of bounty payments. In the absence of government assistance, this is a question best left for Australian business to work out for itself. Governments are not qualified to make these sorts of judgments, and should not attempt to make them through targeted assistance schemes such as bounties. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the tariff on passenger motor vehicles will be reduced by 2.5 per cent per year to reach 15 per cent in the year 2000. In the report of December last year on the automotive industry, the Industry Commission found that the cost to the community of tariff protection for the car industry is currently a massive $1.6 billion per year. That is equal to about $4,000 for each vehicle Australia produces. The customs tariff measures affecting the car industry for the most part implement Industry Commission recommendations, so we have a good idea of the value of these measures to the Australia community. It is estimated that the phased tariff reductions for the car industry will be worth between $640m and $985m each year in additional national product, but the Commission's report on the automotive industry also noted that the industry's ability to compete at the reduced tariff level could be greatly enhanced by successful micro-economic reforms elsewhere in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the industry policy statement delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) quite recently did not address itself to micro-economic reform issues in a satisfactory way, so these gains in competitiveness for the car industry are unlikely to be realised under this Government. We thus find that these Bills reflect the main difficulty with the industry policy statement as a whole. While these Bills make some substantial progress towards the elimination of protection over the next decade, the Government's progress in industry policy is far from uniform and in some cases, as with the Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill 1991, which we debated here last week, the Government has taken a major step backwards towards a protectionist past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, but more specifically on the former. In relation to these Bills, I start with what I believe is a fairly pertinent quotation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am referring to policy decisions in relation to the reduction in protection to negligible levels by the year 2000 . . . I am strongly committed to each of these decisions in their entirety . . . On the decision to reduce levels of protection can I say that overwhelmingly it has been rural and regional Australia-particularly our export industries which have borne an unfair burden in relation to the costs of protection. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting neither a member of the Government nor a member of the Liberal Party; those words of wisdom actually came from none other than the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), in a speech he made to the Federal Council of the National Party on 28 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Members on the other side of this House have to realise that they cannot have it both ways: they cannot have a policy that aims to reduce protection to negligible levels by the year 2000 and then scream every time the Government acts to reduce protection in an industry that does not suit, as members of the National Party consistently do in the bush. I will refer more specifically to this a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives being debated today are a continuation of the Government's strategy since 1983. The Government has been developing an internationally competitive export-oriented industrial structure through a major process of micro-economic reform. This was patently necessary because of the damage caused to our industries as a result of decades of protection. Years of sheltering behind protective barriers left us a legacy of economic woes, inefficient industries that could not compete overseas, higher prices for consumers, and higher costs for our very efficient primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation being debated this evening results from the March industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Building a competitive Australia. That statement resulted from the Government's recognition that the primary industries and resource sectors contribute more than 65 per cent of Australia's total exports. The package of measures announced by the Prime Minister will help us to improve our productive capacity so that our economy will be more internationally competitive. In the Prime Minister's statement, he made it clear that the most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is indeed further tariff reduction. The Prime Minister also made the salient point that the poorest Australians are hurt more by tariffs than are the richest Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister emphasised, the Industry Commission estimates that the burden tariffs impose on the lowest income Australians is three times heavier than that imposed on those with the highest incomes. There is a social justice argument alone for a major shift from a protection-ridden economy. The initiatives announced in the March statement that are addressed in this Bill are as follows: the general level of assistance will be reduced from 10 per cent and 15 per cent in 1991 to a general rate of 5 per cent by 1996; tariffs on motor vehicles will be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent in the year 2000; tariff reductions on textiles, clothing and footwear will be accelerated so that the maximum tariff will be 25 per cent by the year 2000 and the termination of quotas will be brought forward two years to 1 March 1993; and general agricultural assistance will be reduced in line with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to single out two aspects of this legislation for comment, as they are particularly relevant to my vast electorate of Kennedy. Firstly, the adjustment to levels of sugar tariffs: the measures announced in the statement will ensure that Australia's primary and resource industries remain the backbone of Australia's internationally competitive industry structure over the 1990s and beyond. As we have heard, the overall package included lower tariffs across the board, reforms to Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing arrangements and changes to taxation arrangements. This will mean lower input costs and greater competitiveness for the primary industry sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the overall economic package, the Government believes it is appropriate for sugar tariffs to be brought back on track with the spirit of the May 1988 Economic Statement. Prior to the changes implemented in July 1989, it is fair to say that the sugar industry was relatively highly assisted in comparison with other Australian rural industries. In 1988 estimated levels of support were 35 per cent and 25 per cent respectively to the production and refining sectors. I believe that those in the industry who loudly opposed the changes, fearing greatly reduced returns for Australian growers, have been proved wrong. The 1989-90 season was the first season that the Australian sugar industry became subject to new marketing arrangements, including the removal of the import embargo on sugar and the introduction of a tariff system. In fact, as international prices have been quite buoyant for most of the period since 1 July 1989, growers have enjoyed higher returns than they would have had under the old arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sympathetic with those industry groups such as the Australian Cane Growers Council and the Herbert River canegrowers, who are understandably concerned about the impact of the reduced tariffs on their members. However, I believe it would pay them to keep in mind that overall the likely impact of this proposal on sugar producers seems fairly insignificant, especially when set against the backdrop of traditionally volatile and cyclical sugar prices. Other factors, such as world prices, policy changes in major sugar producing and trading nations and the reforms recently announced by the Queensland Government, are likely to be far more important than the tariff changes under consideration here. </PARA>
<PARA> Lower domestic prices will have a further dampening effect on the consumer price index, and make processed foods which include sugar more competitive with imports and in export markets. It is fair to say that with lower tariffs prices to producers and consumers for sugar consumed domestically should be lower than they would otherwise have been. Any expected loss of revenue predicted by the industry should be offset, as lower prices will stimulate an increase in domestic demand and thus greater sales. I am sure domestic users of sugar will welcome lower tariffs, which mean lower production costs. These reforms are part of moves to make the Australian economy more internationally competitive by, apart from anything else, reducing inflation. However, there is a maze of interventions practised by governments around the world which adversely affect export dependent producers such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, that champion of the free market, the United States of America, is right up there with other market offenders, the European Community (EC) and Japan. Only last year the United States Government voted against a moderate reform which would have reduced domestic support for its sugar industry. Recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics research found that a 10 per cent reduction in EC sugar quotas would provide gains of almost $200m in export returns to Australian sugar producers, and US sugar policies cost Australia on average between $123m and $313m per year between 1982 and 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 the US global sugar import quota was found to be illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This resulted from an action launched by Australia in 1988 and offered promise for some measure of reform to the US sugar policy. In September 1990, however, the US replaced the global quota with a tariff quota regime which is expected to have the same practical effect as the global quota. The new arrangements have been quite rightly condemned in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the frustration of the Chairman of the Australian Cane Growers Council, Harry Bonanno, with decisions such as those made recently by the United States. Unfortunately, we cannot as a nation afford to succumb to similar protectionist fall-backs, as our economy depends very heavily on exports. Overall, we export a larger proportion and a wider range of farm produce than almost any other country. The figure is around 70 per cent. To be specific, it is 80 per cent for sugar and wheat, 60 per cent for beef, 95 per cent for wool, 50 per cent for coarse grains, and 60 per cent for dried fruit and canned deciduous fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote the Opposition spokesperson for trade and trade negotiations, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), on the need for the measures concerning the sugar industry introduced in these Bills. When asked on ABC radio in Queensland on 5 April 1991 what the coalition would do about sugar tariffs, the honourable member for Mayo said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our view of tariffs is that in general, not to be specific about sugar, in general Australia has to move away from the era of high protection and we can't say we'd move away from the era of high protection in every industry except sugar. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree. Last night in this House the honourable member for Mayo went further and made the logical point that as our sugar industry is the most efficient in the world, it does not need high levels of tariff protection to beat off foreign competition. It is a shame that his coalition partners in the National Party are not so enlightened. It gets very confusing for rural people when the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), comes out strongly in favour in reducing tariffs, as he did in a speech to his National Council last year, and the honourable member for Mayo supports the effecting legislation in this House, and yet Senator O'Chee is running around country Queensland describing the tariff as the `sugar industry's worst nightmare'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators O'Chee and Boswell are constantly ingratiating themselves with those rural industry leaders who so desperately want to go back to the safe and lazy days of agrarian socialism. It is extremely ironic that it is the likes of those Queensland senators who are the first to damn the socialist Labor Government-yet, what do they want? A government regulated and controlled market place? I believe that it is about time they stopped telling people what they want to hear-depending, of course, on their audience-and got serious about economic policy. We have to be competitive in the world economy. I, for one, have the utmost faith in the most efficient sugar industry in the world to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this Bill that I want to comment on concerns the extension of the existing duty-free entry provision for capital equipment. The savings in import duty will encourage the undertaking of industrial projects in Australia. The measures will allow for greater participation of Australian manufacturers, the boosting of Australia's international competitiveness and increased exports. The extension of duty-free entry to minerals processing equipment not made in Australia in the ordinary course of business will greatly assist the booming mining industry in my electorate of Kennedy. The Australian Mining Industry Council welcomed this move, along with other initiatives announced in the statement Building a Competitive Australia, such as lower tariffs across the board, revised depreciation arrangements and much wider wholesale sales tax exemptions. These provisions will encourage the downstream processing of our resource based industries and further enhance our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not want to waste the time of this House by commenting in depth on the attempt by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) to score a cheap political point by the moving of his amendments, which I do not support, can I say that people in the bush are well aware of what a broad-based goods and services tax will mean to them. They know that they will be paying more for petrol, food, general farm inputs, power, clothing, health services and the like. They know that it is this Government that is acting to reform the waterfront as part of a major program of micro-economic reform of the transport industry. They know that people in the bush will not benefit from the promotion of full and effective competition in telecommunications; that without the current Government imposed system of community service obligations and telephone installation, call costs in the bush would escalate out of sight. They also know that the workers of this country have fought hard for their rights and that the coalition's industrial relations policy will plummet us right out into the Dickensian England era. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of measures now before this House demonstrates that this Government is committed to providing a stable long term environment in which Australian industry can compete internationally and prosper. In conclusion, I again quote from the speech the honourable member for Farrer gave to his Federal Council on 28 October last year, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The world economy in the 1990s is bound to be one of international competition. It has been a measure of our lack of national self esteem that we have felt the need to continually protect local industries, particularly our manufacturing industries. The very act of protection allows the perpetuation of uncompetitive work practices, management techniques and attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Australia will have to become more internationally competitive and the predictable reduction levels of protection will set in place a frame work to encourage more aggressive and competitive attitudes within industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The measures as set out in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 will go a long way towards satisfying the coalition's new-found enthusiasm for a more competitive Australian economy. I indeed support the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991 legislates protection cuts announced in the 12 March statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It deals with the phasing-out of developing country preference margins to newly industrialised countries, implementation of the post-1988 textiles, clothing and footwear plan, protection cuts post-1992 for general manufacturing, TCF and motor vehicles, extension of existing duty free provisions for capital equipment, tariffs on agricultural products, the introduction of a TCF import credit scheme, a free rate of duty for specified products and some other relatively minor changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The financial impact is large in respect of the tariff cuts but reasonably small in respect of the rest of the measures. As my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has said, the Opposition will not oppose the proposed tariff reductions. However, for the motor vehicle and TCF proposals it must be understood that our policy is to bring assistance into line with that for other industries by the year 2000. But that will be in conjunction with a program of comprehensive structural reform, and today we will be moving an amendment to delete the introduction of the TCF import credit scheme and we will move an amendment calling on the Government to implement immediately a program of economy-wide reforms to give Australian industry the means to compete against increased foreign competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, we will again support accelerated phasing down, and out, of the three textile bounties. We will not oppose extension of the metal working machine tools and robot bounty-in line with our previous position on the extension of the computer bounty and the export market development grants scheme. We will not oppose broadening the computer bounty to include printed circuit boards because it is essentially a short term measure. We will, however, oppose the introduction of, or increases in, minimum thresholds in bounty schemes, and we will move amendments to delete these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker made the point quite accurately that it may be true that administrative costs of administering small bounty payments are high, but there is nothing inherently efficient in a large operation. Of most concern, the thresholds may deter potentially efficient new entrants and effectively reduce competition for the larger established producers. Arguments that the lack of thresholds will lead to industry fragmentation are weakened by the fact that all relevant bounty rates are phasing down, and eventually out, in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, we will not oppose either of these Bills but we will propose some amendments that we see as sensible, sane and consistent. However, in considering the Bills I draw attention to the fact that the Government is operating in but one narrow sector of the economy. Certainly, as we have said many times, we support reduction of protection, but only as part of that broader package. But I ask the Government: where are the other measures that industry needs to help it so much? Has the Government not learned from the past?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look for a moment at the 1980s of the Labor Party Government. We have been faced with a long process of transformation of our industry and commerce. We started from a long way behind other countries and we have to restructure the economy in a very fundamental way. But we have to recognise that Australia is a small economy at the edge of the world. We are going through a period of rapid global change in trade patterns-North America, northern Asia and Europe-and the cost of new technology as part of that restructuring is astronomically high. Overseas countries commit heavy government support for research and development, and under this Government our commitment to financial support for R and D in this country has been declining. </PARA>
<PARA> Some industries and technologies are of particular strategic importance-design and process industries, for example. We should not be supporting individual products and individual companies-the winner picking that is so characteristic of what we see even today when we look at this Government's actual policies. International cooperative relationships are vital for the acquisition of knowledge and we have to recognise that our market share in Asia and for technology intensive products in general has actually been declining under this Government. We have minimal involvement in international technology development programs and, unlike some other small Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, Australian industry has not developed strength in any specialised areas of high value added industry. The cost of export market entry places severe strains and demands on the resources of our small firms, and of course there is a very high risk factor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that we build structural competitiveness in Australia, but unfortunately our national system of innovation infrastructure is weak. We have few strong industry clusters and we have very poor networks. Therefore, we must not only implement major reform on the waterfront, in industrial relations and the like, but also implement our technological abilities. There are of course limits to innovation push and we have been very good in Australia at pushing out of universities, R and D facilities and the like some very bright ideas, but industry has not taken them up. Basically it has not worked in this country and perhaps we need to look more at adapting some of those major technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> What is essential is that we, as a nation, keep up funding levels to R and D. We need diffusion of technology and development of our intangible assets. The economic benefits of new technology arise from diffusing that technology throughout the economy rather than from isolated innovation in odd spots here and there, and there are unlikely to be high returns from publicly supported R and D unless there is strong and dispersed demand for improved performance in general, and in new technology in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> A critical area for new technology generation and diffusion is managerial and organisational technology. By this I mean we need higher productivity, a commitment to better quality, greater flexibility at all levels, and innovation of all kinds. We need strategic management of intangible assets, the changing of our corporate culture, the development of skills and knowledge resources, recognition of the significance internationally of reputation-that is, a good reputation, but also where it is a bad reputation, because that will of course damage us-and recognition of the vital role of intra- and inter-firm relationships. There are significant changing trends going on around us. Quality and low cost were always important in manufacture. Now we need to add flexibility as a criterion due to shorter product cycles. I remind honourable members that economies of scale are now being transformed into economies of scope. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Australia has a poor history in the whole innovation field. We tend to take short term views, and focus on the domestic market. Financial institutions have a short term profit need. Inflation, interest rates, regulation, lack of competition and inconsistent government policy in the 1980s have driven many worthwhile companies away, and by `away' I mean overseas or out of business. We have developed a culture of speculative investment, not direct investment. A survey in 1988 of 6,000 firms told us that only 33 per cent-a third-had acquired or even planned to acquire any form of technology. This was primarily for expansion, for adding on to their capacity. There was very little replacement of existing equipment. In other words, we are going to be faced in the years to come, and as we come out of the recession and start to pick up again, with an ageing of our core capacity in all of our industry and commerce across the board. Sixty per cent of the companies surveyed were not even planning to invest in technology in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparing that with overseas, Australia has just half the investment rate in technology of the United States. We are significantly behind Canada and we are very poor compared with Japan and Europe. Of course, we have a very special problem with the large number of small firms. A lot of our problems include a lack of skilled personnel, and we are not seeing any changes coming from the education sector to meet that shortfall. We have a lot of software problems, and there are the interrelated economic difficulties. There is a lack of commitment to training in this country and the Government should be giving the lead. There is a lack of flexibility. By that, I mean flexibility in structure as well as in the numbers that we deploy. There is a lack of vendor support. If we want to import high technology equipment, because we are so remote we often cannot get that direct support. Australia's geographical, cultural and commercial isolation from the manufacturing heartlands of the world is a major problem compared, for example, with the position of Canada, which is just across the border from America, and can ship in that support if it needs it. </PARA>
<PARA> Our poor industrial relations practices mean that we have a low return on investment, our accounting techniques are poor and out of date, and our investment strategies service us not well at all. It is now generally recognised that Australian industry is underinvesting relative to its competitors. Of course, technology is part of the total scenario. What we also need is a broader strategy, and again I ask the Government: where are the reduced Government regulations, the lower taxes, the cheaper fuel and power costs, and the labour market efficiency? Where are the lower cost levels for land transport, shipping, the waterfront or communications, and where are the sustained lower interest and inflation rates?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was talking about the record during the 1980s of the Government and highlighting some of the problems and the sorts of actions that the coalition believes it should be taking to fix some of this country's current chronic economic problems. Of course, the Government has been in office for some eight years. At the end of its present term it will have been there for 13 out of the last 20 years. It can no longer blame the coalition, as it tends to try to do most days in Question Time. What is its message going to be to working Australians about what it is trying to do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard some fine sounding words from the Prime Minister for the long term. He says that his Government is doing something. He says it is reducing protection. He promises to fix the cost imposts on industry and commerce. But where is the actual action? Where are the cheaper power costs? Where is the meaningful anti-dumping legislation to give some balance to the so-called level playing field? The Government should not be fiddling at the periphery. It should be implementing stronger reforms across the board, and it should be doing it now. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look in more detail, in particular, at the amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act. Firstly, I would like to look at the general information industry. In 1987 the Australian information technology industry had sales of nearly $8 billion. In 1989 the top 50 information technology companies in Australia are reported as having had sales of $8.85 billion out of an estimated industry total of $10.3 billion, and employment of over 36,000 people. Australian-owned information technology companies form only a minor part of the industry and they had sales of approximately $1.8 billion in 1989, although this was up 25 per cent over 1988. The Australian Information Industry Association report, published this month-I finally got a copy yesterday-entitled The Development of the Australian Information Technology Industry in the 1990s, claims a 1990 turnover of nearly $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The top echelon of the 50 information technology companies are all multinational corporations. In terms of sales revenue, IBM Australia was the top information technology company in 1989 with sales of $1.4 billion. In fact, IBM Australia's revenue accounts for approximately 10 per cent of the entire domestic information technology industry. At least IBM is doing something about really exporting. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 Telecom ranked second with an estimated $450m in sales, mainly from data communications and other value added services. In that year the top 50 information technology companies had export revenue from $247m to $360m. But less than half of those top 50 companies were exporting themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1989 the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) was asked by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to evaluate the effectiveness of the computer bounty and to make recommendations for future assistance. The BIE concluded that under the bounty scheme the Australian information technology industry has developed considerably, averaging approximately 25 per cent sales growth over the period in which the scheme had operated. The BIE, while not prepared to attribute industry growth solely to the bounty, was prepared to suggest that the bounty has been influential in encouraging industry growth. It also said that there is no doubt that if the bounty had been set at zero the industry would be much smaller and less vibrant than it has been over the past few years. It concluded that the payment of bounty on exported production had assisted firms in gaining exports and the availability of the bounty may have boosted research and development activity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with the concentration of non-Australian owned firms in the computer industry, the net benefit of the bounty to Australia-other than in terms of employment-was considered difficult to judge. In truth, there are more computer vendors in this country than almost anywhere else in the world. They come from America, Japan and Europe. Our indigenous industry is absolutely microscopic. Most of them will either trial products here or dump the end of production lines here. It is a very competitive industry. I say that having functioned in that industry for 10 years or more before I came to this place. </PARA>
<PARA> For the information industries in this country the 1980s was a period of rampant growth, bounty or no bounty. Bounty outlays are around $50m in a market of nearly $10 billion, a mere drop in the bucket. I do not believe that those bounties have really made any significant impact at all. Does the Minister really believe that that bounty has made a significant impact? I would like to hear him respond. Does he really suggest that most of the benefits do not finish up going overseas with all those multinational companies?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian computer hardware sector is either relegated to a minor niche market role or to subcontractor status. The measures in this Bill that we are debating tonight will help a little, but really it is a case of tinkering at the edges. Why does the Government not tackle the big issues? Mr Speaker, I can tell you from bitter experience because my electorate is there, that Victorians are already cursing the Cain-Kirner years-years of protection, picking winners, government interference, failing to tackle the hard problems and borrowing on a huge scale. Australians as a whole are beginning to curse the Hawke-Keating years for just these same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side will not oppose the Bills. We will seek to amend them. Above all, I urge the Government to do all the other things that I have talked about this evening, all those other things that are so necessary to give Australians hope now and a more secure and prosperous country in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the political profiles in Australia may appear confusing to many in the community, there is perhaps no issue that better demonstrates the difference between the two sides of the House than the issue that we are debating tonight; that is, industry development. It is interesting to hear the speakers opposite and to read their comments thoughtfully. When we do so it becomes clear that there is no philosophy in what they are saying; it is fundamental ideology. I refer to the inconsistency, for example, of the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who basically said that nothing should change in industry support and protection and tariffs until all the other things are done that the Opposition talks about on its so-called agenda. I refer honourable members to the speech he made at the textile, clothing and footwear annual dinner last year where he basically said that we need to make the other changes first. He said that to make changes to the protection levels without all the other restructuring is `letting down those sectors and also letting down the economy and the Australian consumers'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that dinner he made it very clear to the textile industry that he would only undertake the tariff reduction programs it spoke of when it had full enterprise bargaining in the industry. That, of course, meant when the employers could set the wage levels at a level that suited them. That is particularly interesting because it is an industry in which some disreputable owners-not all that many-have used the invidious system of out-workers, people working at home on production only on their own sewing machines. They are usually people with a lesser grasp of English, such as migrant workers-virtually modern day slave labour. Most members of that industry are good employers and run productive and worthwhile enterprises, but there are some who will demean the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry is aware of enterprise bargaining. That consists of doing a deal with a lady with no other skills and poor opportunities for work and telling her how much she will be paid to make a pair of shorts or a shirt at home. That is enterprise bargaining. The Opposition wants enterprise bargaining not just in all the textile industries, but in all industry in Australia. The Opposition's agenda is to do the reforms first-mainly enterprise bargaining-and then reduce the tariffs, because then it will not matter. In other words, the workers will take massive cuts in wages and, in that context, we will not need tariffs. That is the philosophy. But it is not a philosophy at all; it is an ideology. It is a view of human values. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were doubtful about the Opposition view, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) strongly reinforced it. Basically he said that we have to remove all our tariffs or we cannot talk about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); otherwise we diminish our capacity in the Uruguay Round. Does anybody in this House, let alone in Australia, believe that for us to have an effective argument at GATT we have to be the only country without some form of assistance to our industries? Do we actually believe that? The only way to believe it is to use it as a justification for an ideological position. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the last eight years has seen the most dramatic changes in Australian industry development is not accidental; the switching from tariffs to bounties has been continuing and has been a hallmark of this Government's performance. The significance of that is that tariffs work to increase the domestic market price; they increase the price to Australian consumers. If we are attempting to develop export oriented industries, clearly a higher domestic price works against that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most remarkable example of the introduction of bounties occurred in the steel industry, with the steel bounty in 1983. That encouraged the investment by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd of substantial amounts-somewhere in the vicinity of $1 1/2 billion to $2 billion-and within a relatively short time we saw BHP again exporting steel. That export growth has been maintained despite difficult circumstances and BHP is now a competitive steel producer in world terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House incorporates extensions to the bounty concepts and schemes. For example, the printed circuit board bounty is a switch from tariffs to bounty, which in turn will mean that industries that use circuit boards which are not available in Australia will find that they are cheaper and industries that are developing and manufacturing circuit boards will be assisted in so doing. The net result of that, of course, is that our export price will be much more competitive. As is the case with so many inputs to manufacturing, the tariff system that we have had for very many decades-not for the last eight years-has increased the cost inputs to manufacturing and hence the add-on costs to exports. The most graphic example in recent times involved the changes that were announced in the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 12 March. They reflected more than a doubling of the tax revenue for the removal of the sales tax on inputs for manufacturing and they will save industry more than twice the tax savings. In other words, in addition to the tariff and tax add-ons, there are also the margins and other costs which input to manufacturing. Whilst the reduction in the tariff itself is important to the manufacturing sector, the actual benefit is invariably much greater than it may appear to be. In looking at this area of advanced technologies, advanced manufacturing and the like-and it is one that the Parliament does not often discuss-it might be of interest for honourable members to be aware of the comments of a Mr Howard Evans, the Chairman of the Council of Australian Machine Tool and Robotics Manufacturers (CAMTROM). A statement from the organisation reads:</PARA>
<PARA>`Federal Government policies in respect of the Australian machine tool and robotics industry are paying dividends and enabling many local manufacturers to get substantial runs on the board', the Chairman of the Council of Australian Machine Tool and Robotics Manufacturers . . . ,</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard Evans, said today. `This sector of Australian industry is clearly attaining world competitive status, and is providing competitive and technologically-advanced solutions for local industry as well', Mr Evans said.</PARA>
<PARA> `Amidst all of the economic doom and gloom that fills the media these days, the success stories coming out of our industry are worth shouting about. What is more, the positive support of the Federal Government over the last six years via its metalworking machine and robot bounty has been the linchpin of these successes', according to Mr Evans. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Evans went on to list a long series of sales, orders, contracts, increased research and development expenditure and contract negotiations developed between Australian companies and overseas companies, all of which he relates back to the last six years of government policy. I quote from the statement again:</PARA>
<PARA>All of the companies mentioned above-</PARA>
<PARA>and there are almost two pages of them-</PARA>
<PARA>have recognised the value of continued Federal Government support for the industry in the form of the metalworking machine and robot bounty which provided payments totalling $14.2 in 1989/90. These companies, and other CAMTROM members, have been using the support provided by bounty to reinvest in R&amp;, design, training and international marketing which is now generating the sort of benefits outlined above. </PARA>
<PARA>Other schemes, such as the grants for industry research and development scheme, have also been well utilised. That is what is actually happening. That is not rhetoric, it is not ideology, it is not politics; it is people in industry saying that for the last six years the Government has been doing it right. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us tonight broadens that. It extends it, firstly, into printed circuit boards and, secondly, into equipment for the working of new materials, because increasingly the new materials of industry-the polymers, the carbon fibres, composites and ceramics-will be future industries, future technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that, for the first time in our country's history, we do these things at the right time. This Government inherited a whole ramp of policies and attitudes which have been long set in the history of Australian conservative governments. With all the new industries that came along in the 1960s-the electronics industry and a whole range of others-Australia was left floundering in the ideology of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time for us to move on to some of the new and future industries. To extend the bounty, which has been so strongly supported by the industry and recognised by the industry as being essential to its development, into the equipment for working new materials is the first chance we as a government have had to be in the right place when these things needed to be done. I think honourable members and others in Australia will find that the development of new materials will move much more quickly than previous industries have when Australia has missed opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of some interest to note that the dichotomy in Australia seems to be widening. I do not know who the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Mayo, or the previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), are talking to in industry. Perhaps they are just talking to some of the people who will benefit from changed protection systems and industry support systems. I wonder how many people they have talked to actually work in the industries involved. If they did, they would find that the Government is pushing the rate of change at the maximum possible level, and it may even be too fast. </PARA>
<PARA> Can our community, and particularly our textiles, clothing and footwear industries adapt without massive pain and suffering to individuals, and potentially massive corporate losses? That is a question that will only be answered with time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker always claims to have set the agenda. If we were to adopt his agenda, we would be moving at a vastly greater rate. He seems to say that people will say that that has to happen-that people know about it and they agree. It is the same old story. The conservatives talk to only a select few. They ought to descend down the line to talk to people directly affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we hear no comment at all in any of the speeches from the Opposition about the need for positive assistance to industries undergoing restructuring. The Government has reaffirmed the commitment to provide up to $120m for textiles, clothing and footwear industries until June 1995, which is a very important point to be recognised. The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industry Development Authority will oversight an industry development strategy comprising the four programs of incentives for international competitiveness, infrastructure support, an import credits program and a capitalisation grants program. The funding for the first two of these will be increased to $15m per annum until 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not simply a question of shifting industry support-that is what we are fundamentally doing-away from tariffs and reducing tariffs towards bounties. It is also a question of proactive policies. What are we doing to ensure that these things work and that our industries become effective? Quite frankly, why should anybody make anything in this country if it can be imported so readily? There has to be a much more positive mind set. </PARA>
<PARA> All the speeches from the Opposition to date are basically saying, `Get rid of tariffs'. Those opposite think that that solves the problem. But what tends to happen if that is all a government does is that companies close down instead. </PARA>
<PARA> I often quote a statement made to me back in 1983 by the Chairman of the Metal Trades Industry Association. He said, `MTIA used to stand for the Metal Trades Industry Association. In the context of 1983 with the metal industry's downturn, nowadays MTIA stands for the metal trades importers association because virtually all of our members are now importers'. Why would they not be? That appeared to be what the government of the day wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> The positive side of industry programs and industry policy, which we hear a massive silence on from the Opposition, is fundamental to the achievements of the last six years in industry restructuring. I must confess that I was surprised that the honourable member for Barker actually mentioned that there have been some successes in the restructuring of the automotive industry. Quite honestly, that surprised me because in everything else that I have read of his or that I have heard from him I have found a lack of knowledge that was staggering. He must have talked to some of the car companies who must have said, `Well, actually, we have made a fair bit of progress here'. </PARA>
<PARA> The progress that has been made in most of our industries has been no better demonstrated than in the statements I mentioned earlier from the Chairman of CAMTROM. The final word on that is that CAMTROM has encouraged the Federal Government to provide ongoing support and facilitation for this important sector of Australian industry. More importantly, CAMTROM members are actively exploring ways in which they can build on existing cooperation between themselves, their customers and a range of consumer organisations in areas such as research and training. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one small segment, one small component, of an overall industry policy. It must be looked at and considered in the context of the tax write-off for research and development, the capital gains tax which levels the playing field between productive investment and speculation, dividend imputation which means that productive companies pay tax on their profits only once, the development of centres of excellence in Australian universities and with a whole range of individual initiatives, all of which are focused towards turning Australia into an outward looking and internationally competitive manufacturing economy. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, I will limit my remarks to the reduction in automotive tariffs and the implications of these reductions in the absence of other associated reforms that should have been part of the whole package of reform. In doing so, I hope to address the concerns of both Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd and the automotive component part manufacturers, including Bridgestone Australia Ltd, that are in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In keeping with the recommendations made by the Industry Commission report into the automotive industry, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) reduced tariffs on motor vehicles and new motor vehicle parts by 2.5 per cent a year to 15 per cent in the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties have led the demand for the removal of tariffs. However, in demanding tariff removal, we have recognised that to reform tariffs without removing structural inefficiencies in the economy would most likely make those industries currently supported by tariffs non-viable. We have, therefore, consistently insisted that tariff reform be accompanied by other micro-economic reforms so that Australian industries are not hamstrung in their efforts to compete domestically and on the world market. That is what we would have expected from the Prime Minister's industry statement. Not only did the statement deliver less than promised; in changing only some of the rules, there is a very real danger that the outcome of these changes could have devastating effects on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of problems facing the automotive industry in Australia. The first is the macro-economic climate, particularly the high interest rates in this country. As the automotive industry requires continual replacement of plant and process both for its new models and to keep abreast of technology, it is highly capital intensive. The interest required to service the capital investment is a direct input into the final price of the finished product. Australia has had high real interest rates on top of interest rates that were already high in order to keep pace with inflation. The effect of this combination of inflation and monetary policy has been to make Australian industry uncompetitive internationally and domestically. How can manufacturers who are paying 20.5 per cent interest on their capital investment compete with overseas manufacturers paying 8 per cent prime rate as in Japan, or 10 per cent as in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the macro-economic climate that makes Australian industry uncompetitive. Australian industry operates in a climate of low labour productivity, high labour costs and on-costs, inefficient and expensive domestic transport, high sea transport costs and a cumbersome, inequitable taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> If the automotive industry is to become competitive and to survive without the protection of high tariffs, reforms are needed in this area. Looking first at labour productivity, I point out by way of introduction that Australia takes twice as long to produce one vehicle as it takes in Japan-38.8 hours compared with 16.8 hours. The difference is not solely due to labour productivity. Japanese plants are far more automated than ours, with more extensive use of robotics. However, labour productivity is certainly an element contributing to the differences, as the following statistics from the Industry Commission report show. A worker in a Japanese automotive factory works 2,360 hours a year. An American worker works 1,852 hours and the Australian worker 1,658 hours-40 per cent less than the Japanese equivalent. Currently, there are 219 plant operating days per year in Australia-27 days less than in Japan and 28 days less than in America. </PARA>
<PARA> Absenteeism in Australia is 8 per cent compared with 2 per cent in the USA and one per cent in Japan. Labour turnover is 40 per cent in Australia, 4 per cent in the USA and 3 per cent in Japan. Every 15 years, Australian workers get three months long service leave; neither Japan nor the US provides any long service leave. Penalty rates for a night shift are 30 per cent in Australia, 10 per cent in the United States and zero in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that Australian workers work less hard than their overseas counterparts, nor that their actual wages are higher; it is the inefficiency of the system that is at fault. At present, national awards provide low margins for extra skills. If the industry is to compete internationally, firms will need the freedom to negotiate awards with their own work forces, to provide the incentives for their workers to increase their skills, and to link wages directly to skill and performance in the workplace. To be competitive, the industry will also need the freedom to negotiate directly with its employees at the enterprise level regarding holidays, penalty rates, long service leave and rostered days off. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport costs impact on the automotive industry at all levels. It is a cost item when raw materials are delivered to component manufacturers, again when motor vehicle components are delivered to assembly plants, and again when the finished product is delivered to the retailer. Land transport in Australia is uncompetitive, with manufacturers forced to rely on road transport because of the lack of frequent rail services, their slowness and their cost. However, completed vehicles shipped by road are subject not only to road grime but also to road gravel that damages the finished product. </PARA>
<PARA> Assessment of transport costs includes not only the direct cost of transport but the cost of storage due to transport inefficiency and delays. Storage at any point along the transport route means additional interest on working capital in terms of holding times, floor space and increased obsolescence and damage. Streamlining production has meant a worldwide move to `just in time' deliveries, which in Japan have led to car assembling plants holding stocks for as little as three hours pre-use. `Just in time' requires a highly reliable regular transport service from the point of delivery to the point of acceptance. A delay anywhere in the system-on the sea, the wharves or land transport-can close down a `just in time' production line. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are waterfront costs high but our wharves are also notorious for the delays they impose on imports and exports alike. One component manufacturer in my electorate explained that he has to keep a three-month stockpile in the US so that he can reliably supply his American customers. Although this cost is making him uncompetitive, the likelihood of a hold-up on the Australian wharves means that he has no choice. It is not just the hold-up on the wharves that makes Australian deliveries so uncompetitive; it is the `she's all right, mate' attitude combined with the likelihood of strikes in any part of the delivery system. This is what makes Australia such an unreliable supplier and why Australian manufacturers have to provide discounts to overseas customers to overcome that threat of delay in supply. </PARA>
<PARA> To survive, the automotive industry has to export; yet cabotage on our coasts and across the Tasman makes it uncompetitive to export to our nearest neighbours. There is a plethora of examples of the cost of coastal and trans-Tasman shipping. To list just a few: it costs $400 less to ship a car to the US than to our next-door neighbour, New Zealand, at a sixth of the distance; it is $60 cheaper for Ford to ship a Capri from Melbourne to the US than it is to ship the same car from Melbourne to Tasmania; it costs $2.09 to ship a wheel from Tasmania to Japan but $3.20-50 per cent more-to ship that wheel to Adelaide. With examples such as this, we do not have to ask why Australian industry is performing so poorly. When the Prime Minister gives a major statement on industry that does not even mention coastal shipping, the Australian people should question how serious the Government is about reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the taxation system-an outmoded, cumbersome system, illogical in parts, nonsensical in others, expensive to administer and, despite the further removal of taxes on business inputs, a continuing burden on manufacturers. Reform of the tax on exports was a major omission from the Prime Minister's industry statement. The Government dropped tariffs and left $1.2 billion in sales tax on exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister should have thrown out the narrowly based, illogical, wholesale tax system and replaced it with a broad-based consumption tax. Of course, he cannot do that, despite the pleas of business. The rhetoric has gone too far and the Government is tied by its own overreaction not to introduce a broad-based consumption tax. The truth is that all the Prime Minister had going for him in the industry statement was a lowering of tariffs. By lowering the tariffs and not bringing in the reform that was needed to make local manufacturing competitive, the Prime Minister has jeopardised the future of local manufacturing and, indeed, the entire economic future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me turn to a major concern in the automotive industry, resulting from the removal of tariffs without other reforms; that is, the effect that tariff reduction will have on the automotive vehicle component part manufacturers. Many of the automotive vehicle component manufacturers are currently squeezed between their suppliers and their customers. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd raises its prices twice yearly while the car manufacturers attempt to cut their costs by demanding price reductions from the component manufacturers. In this climate the reduction in tariffs on new motor vehicle components has put the survival of many motor vehicle component manufacturers in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Already component manufacturers in my electorate are looking to cease local manufacture and to import parts from their parent companies in the US. If this trend is industry wide-and there is nothing to suggest that it is not-there will come a point when almost all the vehicle component parts for Australian assembled cars will be imported. Once this is the case, the car assembly plants may well ask why they are assembling cars in Australia when all the parts for those cars come from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The automotive industry in Australia employs over 60,000 people and exports over $600m worth of goods. By removing tariffs without associated reform of the Australian economy, the Prime Minister has placed the automotive industry and its workers in jeopardy. The long term ramifications may not be restricted to the industry but may well impact negatively on the Australian economy as a whole, leading to a contraction of our manufacturing base and a further reduction in our international competitiveness and an increase in our reliance on imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has failed to assess these ramifications and to give a rationale for limiting major reform to tariff reduction. The lack of a thoroughgoing analysis of the problems facing Australian industry, in particular the automotive industry, makes the statement essentially an inadequate and superficial document. It raises the fear that the statement was basically a public relations exercise, that the Prime Minister's motivation was not so much reform as it was to stamp his authority on economic matters to stave off a challenge for the leadership and to divert Australians from the immediate problems of the current recession that was engineered by his Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which are before the House. In so doing, I acknowledge that the changes proposed here represent the end of an era. It is not lost on me, a new member, that the early phase of Australian federation and Australian politics was essentially one of protectionism versus one of removing those protectionist clauses in differing aspects. After about 90 years of federation, these Bills finally send that to the history books. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I am able to address these two Bills on this historic occasion and to make some comments on the effects that they will have on the Australian economic environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) made a number of comments with regard to the effects that this legislation will have on the economy and the Australian environment. I am pleased to be able to take up one or two of the points that she so kindly put. I would like to ask her whether she has discussed her comments with some of the previous speakers in the debate, in particular the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who did make some comments about the future and the past as represented by the previous protectionist policies that have been in place in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> With these changes, notably things such as the changes to the tariffs, we are certainly exposing an industry and in that case, I will admit, the jobs of workers to overseas competition. But what the honourable member for Hawker seems to have forgotten in her speech is that the comments made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) and, indeed, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), in addressing this Bill today and last night, acknowledge that the gains that have been made to the rural industries are real and substantial and that the reduction of these tariffs to negligible levels means that the resultant savings go into family farms, family farms' bank accounts. This little aspect seems to have been overlooked and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of tariff bounties means that capital equipment can be imported at a lower cost, so once again all the resultant savings go to the good farming families of Australia. Consequently, their non-removal, as the honourable member for Hawker seems to favour, would mean that again we would be taking out hundreds of millions of dollars from farming families across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) did point out that the Bill gives effect to the tariff changes announced by Senator Button as part of the statement Building a Better Australia. He went on to point out the importance of the certainty which the announced tariff changes will provide to the importing community, that is, that it is a vital matter for the future of this nation. However, I want to direct my remarks specifically to tariff assistance as it affects agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the March industry statement, I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) pointing out that sugar, dairy and beef production and banana growing industries in my electorate are major industries; and it is fair to say that those industries, together with horticultural production, underpin the regional economy of Richmond and generate employment and income essential for the prosperity of the towns in my electorate. I put forward the view that, although it is abundantly clear that the Government must accelerate its program of industry change and industry reform, because in the future Australian industries must change so that they can take on all comers, in orchestrating those changes it is important that the Government recognises that the necessity for reform is accompanied by a full examination of the relevant issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my view at the time of writing that in relation to the sugar industry, the industry inquiry foreshadowed by the Government should be allowed to proceed before the decisions relating to the level of tariff assistance were actually made. I commend the Minister for his help to the industry in this matter. While the decision to phase down tariffs on general agricultural products is consistent with the Government's process of restructuring the economy to improve the productivity and efficiency of Australian industry, the Government's decision to examine long term assistance for the sugar industry only on completion of inquiry into the Australian sugar industry by the Industry Commission is to be welcomed. That inquiry is now in progress, having commenced on 22 March. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry to cover both raw and refined sugar will, through its report, identify initiatives which will raise the economic efficiency of the industry. In announcing the inquiry, the Industry Commission states that the terms of reference require the Commission to consider the national and international marketing environment for sugar cane and sugar. In particular, the Commission is to advise on the appropriate form and level of tariff to apply from 1 July 1992. Even for those who are in primary production, the effect and impact of tariffs, or the lack of them, is difficult to comprehend. The honourable member for Hawker might be in the same category as primary producers. For the general public who try to follow the matter of tariff reduction and those who merely notice it in the media, there is not always a clear understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 March the Daily News, circulating in the Tweed-Murwillumbah region in the Richmond electorate, carried the by-line `Canegrowers king hit' and went on to report that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australian Canegrowers' Council Chairman Harry Bonanno said the statement-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the March industry statement-</PARA>
<PARA>`king hits' the raw sugar industry at a time when it is already reeling from low sugar prices. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The industry statement was also a breach of the Government's promise not to change industry tariffs until after this year's Industries Commission Inquiry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I know that a lot of cane farmers felt let down when they read this. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government wanted to wait until the inquiry before the Commission had been concluded before long term decisions were made, the Government considered in the context of the overall economic package that it was appropriate for sugar tariffs to be brought back on track in the spirit of the May 1988 economic statement. That will lead to readjustments to tariffs to $76 per tonne from 1 July 1991 and $55 a tonne from 1 July 1992. By maintaining a specific rate tariff, the industry will remain protected in the event of low world prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Many cane farmers in the Richmond electorate are concerned with this move for them into previously uncharted territory. Many are still suffering from the effects of droughts followed by floods. Many believe that they may actually have to leave the industry. Many are concerned that the trade battles between the United States and the European Community have trapped them and that they have nowhere to actually turn. In that context, it is hard to talk about the long term economic good for Australia and the sugar industry, because they and their families are hurting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has shown a real understanding of the issues. Indeed, even in this time of economic stress, the honourable member for Werriwa, Mr John Kerin, still remains arguably the most popular Minister to occupy the Primary Industries portfolio. I note that the Minister also recognises and acknowledges the hardships affecting people in the industry. In his message to the Australian Cane Farmers Association at Ballina, which is in the electorate of Page, almost in the electorate of Richmond, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that in the short to medium term, a number of our rural industries are facing a severe test. </PARA>
<PARA>This affects individual farmers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>Many are experiencing real difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to target assistance to these people, I will be taking a submission to Cabinet seeking to boost funding for the rural adjustment scheme . . . this month. </PARA>
<PARA>I wholeheartedly support that move for people working in the industry who have been affected. Many will, with help, be able to survive this downturn and, with the resilience of rural people that we have come to recognise and in some cases rely upon, will be able to take advantage of the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the positive aspects to have come out of the tariff reductions, which I mentioned a little earlier but would like to reiterate, is the direct benefits to agriculture of something between $350m and $400m in the reduction of import costs. Those particular cost savings are passed on to the farmers and their families and go back into the Australian economy. The apparent attempt by honourable members on the opposite side to tie up the relationship between the problems in reducing tariffs and the impost of a consumption tax needs to be explained or at least exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker did mention this aspect, the lack of supposed micro-economic reform, and mentioned amongst other things shipping costs and this aspect of tariffs and consumption tax as part of micro-economic reform. The fact is that some $2m to $3m has been passed on to the sugar industry alone by the cuts in tariffs; they are simple savings to that industry. An impost of a consumption tax, like the reintroduction of tariffs, is going to take that money away from the families in that industry. One thing that seems to be overlooked by certain honourable members on the Opposition side is how those people will be hurt and will have their incomes reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak tonight in this cognate debate mainly in connection with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. In doing so, I must say that I speak in support of the circulated amendments proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). Really, what we are doing is looking at some of the legislation that came from Building a Competitive Australia, and I must say with respect to that that it was a singular flop. It seems that no-one-no editor, no journalist-is really taking it seriously as a means of effecting a competitive Australia that will trade in the year 2000. Why is it a spectacular flop? Because it only addresses one major area of reform, but neglects the other parts of that reform that are necessary if we are to have a competitive Australia by the year 2000. In tariff reductions, as I say, we are looking at only one part of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This also represents a massive amount of breaking of commitments to industry right around Australia. We talk about certainty and predictability as being the requirement for a competitive Australia so people can take the risk and go ahead, but that has not been the case over many years that Labor has been in operation, particularly in the major industries, the manufacturing and the rural industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except the gold tax, which has been a rather predominant argument within this House, and for another reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer particularly to what we are doing in the sugar industry. I listened with interest to the apologist for the Labor Party, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), trying to put down an argument in this place as to why he is going to support it. It is a revisit of 1988-89. I had a lot to do with it at that stage, at a time when the conservative parties of Australia did not have a firm commitment to the resolution of reduction of tariffs by the year 2000 to a negligible level. We operated on that basis, and I will give the comparisons of the revisit. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no consultation with the industry before this action was taken, and on every occasion the Queensland sugar industry and the Queensland State were working towards a renewal of legislation that was currently before them. It was pre-emptive, and as far as the Act was concerned a new regime was introduced for tariff rates. As I said, it is a revisit for those particular purposes, but it is a tragedy that it was made necessary, and I list this amongst another lot of broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has relied on Building a Competitive Australia for the reduction of these tariffs. At page 3.13 it said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the interim, however, the Government believes it is appropriate that assistance for the sugar industry be brought back on track with the spirit of the 1988 decision, which was altered following a Senate Standing Committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The specific rate tariff for raw and refined sugar will therefore be adjusted from the scheduled $95 per tonne to $76 per tonne at 1 July 1991, and from $70 per tonne to $55 per tonne at 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a wrong premise. The National Party of Australia was very instrumental in forming a Senate inquiry with the support of the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats. We brought in what was considered appropriate by an all-party Senate committee; that is, an ad valorem tariff was not applicable after the embargo removal where the industry wanted some security of price which the ad valorem would not give. It was only after that report that the Minister instigated the present regime of the specific duty tariff. That was the way to go down without being affected by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say why this was necessary. When we look at the average world price of exported sugar we see that in 1985 it shrank to US4.03c per pound. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A figure of US4.03c, which I would believe is probably about two-thirds of its actual cost of production. It then moved up to US6.05c. By 1988 we were determined that there would be that security until 1992. Fortunately, because of that regime and because the prices have improved, the price has gone up to 12.55c, but currently rests a lot lower. The Government is not telling the truth when it says that it will return to the old regime because that was not the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will also mention the broken promises by Labor to the sugar industry in the time that I have been here. In the 1983 election policy there was a promise that sugar would be underwritten. At a time when it was most desperately needed, when those prices were so low, not one cent was forthcoming-it was only forthcoming for the purpose of reconstruction. Labor also neutralised the income equalisation deposits, completely wiped it out, so that it was of no effect as a proper equalisation device to incomes and profits over that period. The averaging announcements were much more drastic as far as that was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs have been adjusted without any reference back to the industry and deregulation is moving onto a State basis. I will just mention something about the former State Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland who is now in control of sugar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A chap by the name of Casey. Unfortunately we share identical electorates. The Minister for Small Business and Customs, who is at the table, will be interested in this. Mr Casey got up at a meeting in Cairns, or some place such as that, and said that we needed a new organisation. He said something along these lines, `These cane farmers are very good chaps, but they cannot handle financial decisions. As a result of that they do not now enjoy a majority on the corporation that is there'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Farmers are unable to stay on a farm-in any business these days-unless they have the financial capacity to control costs and run the farm as a business and not a farm. I think the Minister at the table would have to agree that it cannot be done because all the other people who were there are going out the back door. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Casey's comment is particularly relevant because in the 1960s he was a working director of a failed company in liquidation. As the corporate chairman he is in no better position than the remarks he makes in connection with others. It is said that our own Minister is a failed chook farmer and that he has gone back into the business of telling people how to run their affairs when perhaps he was not so good at that himself. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the point. The Labor argument has always been that we have to make Australian industry effective and competitive. No-one would deny that it is probably the second largest rural exporter for our country or that it is efficient. It has to be to survive. It has been said that by withdrawing the subsidy we would be able to get into the GATT rounds and tell the European Community (EC)-the United States of America (USA), the Japanese and all the other countries involved-how to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The European Community, and in particular France, subsidises its domestic price to the extent of $809 per metric tonne. On a world price of $258, that is an effective subsidy of $551. It then puts its sugar on the world market at dumped prices. Thailand enjoys an effective subsidy on its own grown product of $446, and the USA $356. By comparison Australian cane farmers will now enjoy, or suffer, 28 per cent next season and 21 per cent the year afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA> It is rather interesting that a constituent of mine who has just been over to America came back with an article which I believe is relevant. Unfortunately it is undated. The headline reads: `Govt. Makes You Pay Extra For Sugar-And Fat Cat Growers Live Like Kings'. How much has the Government's effort of two or three years ago been effective in coming to grips with that problem?</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, the Senate inquiry suggested that there had to be an effective anti-dumping arrangement. What has been done? Absolutely nothing. The coalition parties in the Senate have forced an inquiry on anti-dumping that will become effective and will be-can only be-the effective mechanism which ensures that sugar is not dumped in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot say that sugar is not coming in. As I understand it, in Sydney sugar is coming in from Fiji under a concessional rate and thousands of tonnes of sugar are imported to Australia. Whether it comes from Thailand, the EC, or the USA, we know what benefits they have had. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thing is a sham. The Government cannot impose this sort of legislation in the form of one mechanism without looking at the others. I want to mention particularly market reforms and labour. Nothing has been done by Labor in this regard. This is what I have argued for since 1984-85. The industry would be happy to deregulate if the Government were prepared to deregulate its other protected industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the spectacular successes that there have been when that particular situation has been challenged: Mudginberri, Dollar Sweets, and a 48 per cent improvement in productivity at SPC over the last three months after an agreement with employers. Power Brewing in Queensland is about the only brewery that has been able to establish itself and be profitable under its own steam. When one looks at Robe River one sees a 400 per cent increase in productivity in that time. In my own area probably the most militant unionists of all-the miners-are prepared to look at productivity, face redundancy and look at work practices if the Queensland Government reduces rail freight. The only thing stopping that agreement at the moment is the Government's intractability in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Had I a full 20 minutes, I could talk of the necessity, as the farmers see it, of having a clean float of the dollar-not a dirty float, with the dollar propped up by interest rates. At the time this Bill was introduced, in 1989, the Government was actually buying its own currency to push up the price. Once the price of the dollar is pushed up, the returns of the individual farmer are pushed down. That is the complaint across Australia: high interest rates force up the dollar and the high dollar forces down the profits. The farmers are caught in that mechanism. The Government has no plan of action, either in this legislation or in the Building a Competitive Australia, in this regard. I am arguing for a clean float and a labour market which is prepared to look at a decentralised system. In many other respects this legislation is a sham. I argue, as I did three years ago, that we should look at the whole range of mechanisms, as indicated in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). I support the amendment and hope that the sugar industry will see the Australian Labor Party for the fraud that it is, and will see that it is run by hacks, not experts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am privileged to have such a famous audience tonight. In the 10 minutes allotted to me in this cognate debate I want to speak specifically to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which legislates for the protection cuts announced in the 12 March statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as well as several other tariff changes announced previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has been very consistent in its approach to this legislation by saying that it supports the general thrust of tariff reductions. In fact, we have dragged the Government along with our announced policy in reducing protection. The shadow Minister for industry, technology and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), put the Opposition's policy right on the map early in the piece, and it became very clear that was the direction in which we were going to go. Therefore, as members of the Opposition have said many times, we were pleased when the Prime Minister in his statement on 12 March at least went some very small way down the track towards doing one fundamental thing to give Australia a more competitive economy; that is, reducing the protection which has cost Australia dearly for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> As Opposition speaker after speaker has said in this debate, the main deficiency of this Bill, and indeed the glaring deficiency in the Government's whole approach to this area of economic management, is that it is prepared to take the step of reducing tariffs without implementing the necessary complementary micro-economic reforms. Australian industry is justifiably extremely apprehensive about the effect of tariff reductions without the guaranteed reforms in place to complement those reductions. Clearly, Australian industry does not trust this Government to implement reforms. Why should it? The Government has shown itself to be wanting time after time when it comes to making tough decisions about micro-economic reform. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Government does not have the integrity, and the people of Australia know it. Therefore, when the Prime Minister talks about reducing tariffs, the Australian population is entitled to be extremely sceptical about the effect that will have without the necessary complementary reforms. I do not think this Government is capable; it has lost its way-and we see evidence of that time after time in this place, from the top down-does not know where it is going and is lacking in leadership. I believe the Government has shown itself to be completely incapable of delivering the complementary reforms. The Government has held up the waterfront as the watershed, as it were, of its reform policy, and yet that is one glaring example of the Government's inability to deliver. I read the following article in the Australian on Monday which had the headline `Pay claim sets back reform on waterfront':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Waterfront reform has received a significant setback because of union claims for wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the quid pro quo for waterfront reform as far as the unions were concerned was not being met; I suppose the unions wanted more quids for less pros. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>One of Australia biggest waterfront operators, Conaust Ltd, revealed yesterday that drafting talks with unions on an enterprise agreement for Sydney had collapsed last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA>The chairman and managing director of Conaust, Mr Richard Setchell, said yesterday unions were blocking progress because employers would not agree to excessive wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Setchell said, and these are important words because I believe they sum up not only the waterfront situation but also the attitude of Australian industry:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian waterfront is being held to ransom by the waterfront unions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is disgraceful. But even in the Government there are people who have a vision for solving the problems facing Australia. I quote from a speech made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) the day after the Prime Minister's statement. The honourable member for Lalor, the man who was too good for the Government front bench after the last election, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1991 Australia finds itself further back in terms of international competition than it was in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now speak briefly about a couple of industries I have been involved with and have some experience of: firstly, the motor vehicle industry. For 40 years we have protected-or aided and abetted might be a better description-this industry, and where are we today? Finally, this Bill gets around to introducing tariff reductions in the motor vehicle industry-from 35 per cent in January 1992 down to 15 per cent by January 2000, with annual reductions of 2.5 percentage points. In the view of the Opposition, there is no doubt this is a step in the right direction. The Industry Commission report dealing with the motor industry pointed to significant gains to the community as a whole from substantial further reductions in protection. Estimates in that report were based on the Orani model and pointed out that the longer term net effects of substantial reductions and protection would be to increase Australia's gross national product by between $640m and $985m each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Garnaut report is another excellent treatment of the effects of protection. That report has been generally adopted by the Government; certainly it has been adopted by the Opposition. The automobile industry is one industry that really indicates for all to see how useless protection has been in fostering Australian industry; it illustrates more than any other industry the need for improved industrial relations practice. Certainly that is the fundamental problem in industrial relations practice; when we talk about micro-economic reform-and that terminology may not mean a lot to all Australians-one of the important parts of that is the industrial relations system. As we on this side of the House have made perfectly clear, when the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) becomes Prime Minister, our first priority in government will be to bring about a whole new change in the industrial relations climate in this country, to introduce change that will allow true enterprise bargaining and a new approach to the setting of wages which will allow people to be properly rewarded for enterprise and for productivity increases. That will improve Australia's competitiveness more than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> The other industry that I want to briefly refer to is the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Once again, we have here an example-particularly with the footwear industry-of an industry that has been protected for years and has gone backwards rather than forwards. It is an industry where there has been enormous protection, which over the years since 1974 has cost Australians millions of dollars. For instance, it is quite clear to anyone who buys shoes that for imported shoes we pay some three times as much as we should. In other words, the retail level of shoes is three times more expensive than it ought to be. I think that is a terrible indictment. The industry that is manufacturing shoes in Australia has been quite woeful in terms of the quality of the goods that it has produced. It has survived to the extent that it has only behind a protective barrier, for which the Australian community has paid tens of billions of dollars over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> I must finish. I know that the clock does not run out tonight and so we have to watch the other clock. I have had only a few minutes; I would like to have had more time. We will continue to support the Government where it is fair dinkum about reform in the economy. We support the thrust of tariff reduction-we are totally committed to that-but we are strongly critical of the Government for introducing tariff reform in isolation, without all the other reforms which must be in place if tariff reform is to be fair and equitable and, what is more important, if it is to work. </PARA>

The Government got it wrong, and the coalition proposes to put forward an amendment to correct the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been very little consultation with the printing industry on this matter. I have had representations from a number of book printers, including a number of book printers from within my electorate, in the city of Maryborough, which has become known as a major printing centre throughout Victoria. I was contacted by Harlequin Mills &amp;Boon. That name would be known to many people. The firm wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we simply cannot afford a cost increase at this moment in time of 14%, and are already actively looking for alternative printing sources. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was thinking about heading offshore and printing these books overseas. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A further point is that previously, we had a number of years in which to work with The Book Printer-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a firm which prints in Maryborough-</PARA>
<PARA>to make them efficient, in a world sense, and now we have no time at all to make any decision whatsoever, except to take our work elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>The company also drew my attention to the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>At the beginning of this year we made arrangements to use Australian made paper for our books instead of using imported paper. This has gone down particularly well with the consumer and has helped us and The Book Printer to remain competitive this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, should we be forced off-shore, which appears to be the Government's intention, then this effort, whilst I acknowledge in the overall scheme of things is fairly small, would go to waste. </PARA>
<PARA>We would have to increase our prices by a minimum of 25c a book in order to recover our loss of bounty, which will cost us approximately $500,000 per annum. While these figures may not appear to be high, many of our customers purchase several books at a time. I know one customer who purchases 37 books a month, and therefore the impact on our major customers will be significant. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what the Government was proposing with this increase, and it really does not understand what the book bounty does. The Government pays a bounty to publishers of books to help them with the cost of production and printing. The idea is to make books cheaper and, therefore, to encourage both the writing and the reading of books; or at least that is the way it used to be in theory.</PARA>
<PARA> The bounty is a subsidy paid upon production of evidence as to the cost of the book. Another way of achieving protection of the book publishing industry in Australia would be to apply a tariff to imported books; but this has been considered undesirable because of the aim to encourage book readership. The bounty threshold is a figure which triggers the actual payment of the bounty. Currently, the bounty on books is 12.5 per cent, with a threshold of $500. For example, if someone spends $10,000 producing a book, the bounty payable would be $1,250; because this figure is greater than $500, one is paid $1,250. So the proposal to increase the bounty threshold to $2,000 would have a very serious effect on the book production industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I had representations from a number of printers within my electorate who are very active and very progressive in this field. The Book Printer in Maryborough has developed over recent years and is a major contributor to the work force and employment opportunities in the Maryborough area. It does have the latest equipment. In fact, Senator Button, a colleague of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who is at the table, opened the new plant in Maryborough during 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), attended that opening and witnessed the fantastic range of modern, high-tech equipment which the Book Printer had installed at that factory. It drew quite some praise from the honourable senator, who is responsible for industry in that State. Now we find that the Government's wheels have fallen off. It does not really understand what the book industry is about, and now it has introduced this $2,000 per title threshold for the bounty without really understanding it. I would have thought that the Minister would have gathered a fairly good understanding of the industry from those people on his visit to that plant; but quite obviously he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I also took the time and effort to contact the Australian Print Group, another book printing organisation in the Maryborough area, and it felt along similar lines to the letter that was forwarded to me from Harlequin Mills &amp;Boon, setting out exactly what would happen if this $2,000 bounty threshold were put in place by the Government. The Australian Print Group was horrified to think that it would have such a dramatic impact on its business, which it has built up over the last 10 to 12 years. It is a major employer in the area, providing opportunities which, I believe, probably would not have been available in that area; that is, some very high-tech book printing. </PARA>
<PARA> This company prints some very good quality books which are distributed Australia-wide, and it has an extremely good reputation because of the quality of its printing. It will be decimated if this $2,000 bounty which the Government has put in place is persisted with. It will have a very serious impact on its operations. Once again, it will find itself in a position where it will have to retrench staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Maryborough is a city with a population of about 8,000. It is highly industrialised, with textile, engineering and book printing industries. The economic downturn of this country has already had a very severe impact on Maryborough, and the lack of sales in the textile industry has led to dramatic retrenchments at its textile operation. The Government, by its action in introducing this proposed threshold, has shown very little understanding of what the book printing industry is about. Obviously it is intending to impose the same type of impact on the book printing industry as has been felt by the textile industry. I was pleased when our spokesman, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), foreshadowed the amendment which will oppose the increases in those minimum thresholds in the bounty schemes, and I support the amendment. I believe we have to bear in mind that here is an industry in a provincial city of Victoria which is adopting a very good approach to the introduction of high technology and also, as I indicated, is well prepared to use products made in Australia-using local paper manufactured in Australia to produce those books I referred to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill currently under debate include a large number of measures, most of which are giving effect to proposals announced in the Federal Government's Building a Competitive Australia statement last month. The Bills include many pages of tariff changes, including more than 48 pages of schedules in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill alone. The tariff and bounty changes included in the Bill cover a huge range of industries, and most have broad community support. The Bill introduces changes to highly protected industries such as textiles, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicles, but it also cuts tariff protection to a wide range of foodstuffs, arts and craft, ships and their repairs, and even wheelchairs and heart pacemakers. Every time tariff protection is reduced, the gross income earned in that industry is reduced. Companies and individuals involved in that industry can sustain such reductions in income only if, at the same time, their costs are reduced and their productivity improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his 12 March statement announced further cuts in tariffs and therefore further reductions in income for many Australian industries, he failed to come to grips with the other side of the equation. There is no industrial reform, no waterfront reform, no significant improvements in the tax structure-indeed, no commitments to any kind of change which would demonstrate that this Government has any vision which would give the people of Australia confidence that they can look forward to a more competitive Australia. There is no vision for a country better able to pay its way in a competitive world, a country which can offer the prospect of economic security and prosperity for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this Bill effectively breaks earlier commitments that the Government made to industries and highlights yet again why no industry can invest in this country with any confidence. The rules keep on changing. The Government treats its agreements with contempt. Its word is completely worthless. No wonder it needs to talk of resource securities legislation. No one in the timber industry believes it when it just says that a forest is available for harvest. Now the Government proposes to legislate to force itself to keep its own word. No one will believe it. Ask the wheat industry about the promise the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made to it and, after this Bill, ask the sugar industry. The sugar industry's 1989 tariff agreements have been contemptuously disregarded by the Prime Minister's statement of 12 March. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-1989, the embargo on sugar imports into Australia was lifted and, following an extensive Senate inquiry, a specific tariff of $115 per tonne was introduced. This tariff was scheduled to fall to $95 per tonne on 1 July this year and then to $70 per tonne on 1 July 1992, by which time the Industry Commission was to have reported on what future level of assistance should apply to the industry. The Industry Commission inquiry has just begun but, on its current record, there is little doubt that the Commission would have recommended an ongoing regime of tariff reductions. The industry is naturally concerned about lower tariff levels but it was learning to adjust, to make the necessary changes to live within its new economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise that I do not argue that the sugar industry should be immune from continuing tariff reductions. The industry was, however, given a tariff reduction schedule less than two years ago and those scheduled tariff reductions were sharp and much more severe than those applied to other Australian industries. The Government's 12 March announcement, therefore, to reduce the tariff applying to sugar imports from $115 per tonne to $55 per tonne-55 per cent in under 15 months-came as a major shock to the industry. This Government announcement pre-empted the Industry Commission inquiry altogether, and for some unexplained reason put the sugar industry in a different group from other industries currently scheduled for tariff reviews, such as dairying and tobacco. The sugar industry, which has already faced tougher tariff reductions than those faced by other industries, is now expected to bear further burdens. </PARA>
<PARA> These tariff reductions come at a time when the world price for sugar has declined from US16c per pound to less than 9c per pound. It also comes during a period of major industry restructuring being imposed by the Queensland Government through primary industries Minister Casey, one of the bevy of failed Labor leaders now serving in the State Ministry. This same Minister is seeking to expand production in Queensland while the Federal Government moves to cut income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's tariff decisions are estimated to carve over $13m off the Queensland industry's income in 1991 and a further $10.3m in 1992. The effect on the New South Wales industry will be even greater because that industry is more dependent upon the domestic market. Eighty per cent of Queensland's sugar is sold on the world market and is therefore totally exposed to the vagaries of international price movements. Ordinary local farmers are critically affected by such issues as the cost of shipping, international currency movements, multilateral trade agreements and the failure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and massive country by country subsidy programs. </PARA>
<PARA> World sugar trade takes place in what is probably the most corrupt market in the world for any commodity. Domestic subsidies are often several hundred per cent. Many countries have total import bans. Others, like the United States of America (USA), have quotas guaranteeing that the world market is anything but free and fair. The Herbert River District Canegrowers Executive at Ingham wrote to their Federal member, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), and sent a copy of that very interesting letter to other members of Parliament. That executive pointed out that on 1 March 1991 the world sugar price was $A258.08, but the domestic price in the USA was $615.04, in Thailand it was $704.70 and, in the European Economic Community, France received $809.49. This means that there are enormous local subsidies applying in all of the major sugar producing countries of the world. Indeed, it makes the $55 a tonne proposed for the Australian industry look very small indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is any real progress being made in effecting any kind of liberalisation in world sugar trade. The major exporting nations have increased their concentration of total exports, with five countries now accounting for 77 per cent of the world trade in sugar. Australia ranks with Thailand behind Cuba and the European Community. Australia has been building its tariff policy around its commitment to the Uruguay Round of GATT. We are told it is necessary for Australia to reduce its tariff barriers to demonstrate our good faith at GATT and to encourage the larger, more powerful nations to demonstrate that they will follow our lead. However, it is quite clear that this philosophy is not working. In its 1990 annual report the Australian Sugar Milling Council concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>The outcome of the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations under GATT has been most frustrating for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are the laughing-stock of the world. It goes on to point out how the EC and other countries have failed to respond to any of the initiatives taken by Australia and other trading nations. The Australian industry, which is more completely exposed to the chills of international competition than probably any other sugar industry in the world, is now exposed even further without any concessions having been won from our trading competitors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the reductions in tariff protection to Australia, there is a strong likelihood of increased sugar imports into this country. Because this Government has failed to do anything about waterfront reform, coastal shipping, domestic transport costs, et cetera, sugar can be landed in Sydney from Bangkok at the same freight rate as applies from Bundaberg. Cities further away from Queensland will even have a freight advantage to import from other countries. This fact is a disgraceful indictment on the failure of the Labor Government to achieve any significant structural reforms in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the major threat to Australia comes from Thailand, a country which enjoys preferential trade status into Australia. The Prime Minister's 12 March statement announced the freezing of preferential tariffs for Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea. Why did he limit that change to those four countries out of the 160 countries and locations that receive preferential treatment? Why was Thailand not on that list? It is one of the major sugar producers of the world and now threatens the Australian industry. Thailand gets the benefit of 200 per cent local domestic tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, supposed to be anti-dumping procedures to protect Australian products from these subsidised products, but they are slow, bureaucratic, costly and ineffective. On the very rare occasions when anti-dumping action actually succeeds, the Australian industry has often been destroyed while it waits for justice. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for solid and affirmative action to do something about improving the anti-dumping procedures. I am hopeful that the current Senate inquiry will report on new measures to make the arrangements fair and equitable. The Prime Minister's extra 40 days, whilst welcome, is limited help indeed. The process needs to be speeded up to a maximum of 55 days in total, there needs to be assistance to small industries to enable them to effectively mount their case, and there needs to be appropriate recognition of the real worth of these industries to our national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry is one of the great Australian industries and it has made an enormous contribution to our national economy and helped build the cities, particularly of north-eastern Australia. Production has reached a record of 3.8 million tonnes in 1989 and it has a capacity to contribute more. This industry deserves the support of the Australian Government, not the condemnation that runs through this particular Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame that tonight we have before the House this legislation standing on its own as the easy way of solving Australia's economic problems-easy way for the Government, that is; the flick of the pen that reduces tariffs without any real application by the Government to the deep structural problems of the Australian economy. These problems include high interest rates, lack of effort and energy in regard to macro-economic reforms, the balance of payments issues, the cost of labour and the productivity of the nation. All of those things are unattended to by the Government. But here we have legislation tonight which really places out in the cold, harsh chill many of Australia's great manufacturing industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regrets of the Opposition are these: the Government has produced a part package but refuses to take action on the hard parts, the parts that really need determination, a sense of vision and a willingness to cope with the underlying problems confronting Australia which will of themselves produce far more effective competitiveness than the reduction of tariffs alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is endorsing these tariff and bounty changes. We will be moving some small amendments to them, but we are not opposing them, despite the havoc that is being created in Australian manufacturing industries by the Government. I am speaking about the loss of jobs in the automotive industries, the dreadful situation being faced, particularly by women employees, in the textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries and the loss of jobs that could occur across the board on top of those losses already taking place. It is a tragedy that the Government cannot see how short-sighted its policies are. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Opposition has a comprehensive approach to these matters. Tonight we are endorsing the phasing out of developing country preferences-which is a good move-an acceleration of the cuts in protection to the textile, clothing and footwear industries-as I have said, it is tragic that they go unsupported by other major reforms-and the protection to motor vehicles, the extension of existing duty free provisions for capital equipment and agricultural products, the TCF credit scheme in regard to one Bill, the phasing out of textile bounties, metal working machine tools and robot bounties, the computer bounty and minimum annual thresholds proposed under the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. This is a reduction of protection which is created by bounties and tariffs-the classic systems of protecting an industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry does not need the level of protection that it has at the moment but it does need to be given a chance to perform. That is the very area in which the Government is refusing to support Australian industry. Whether it be the sugar industry, the automotive industry or any other industry, the job queues are rising, the bankruptcies are increasing and the Government appears unable to take serious action. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to an excellent report prepared for the Business Council of Australia by Access Economics and the Allen Consulting Group Pty Ltd which is entitled Developing Australia's National Competitiveness. It is one of a series of reports that have come forward from a variety of sources over the last few months. Each report has produced significant input into the direction that the Government needs to be taking. It is imperative to take this action to drag Australia and those wonderful Australians working in the manufacturing industries out of the mire that we are currently in. In chapter 3 of this report prepared for the Business Council of Australia there is space given to comparing Australia's relative strengths and weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the points that are made in this excellent report is that Australia rates poorly overall in factors that shape competitiveness. If we analyse Australia's competitiveness, we see that the report says that we compete very strongly when we look at the natural endowment utilisation of the nation, the use of human resources, socio-political stability and the impact of the state. But things start to go wrong for us as a nation when our industrial efficiency is way below that of comparable countries. Our market orientation is not good; our financial dynamism is not good; the dynamism of the economy is not good. One only has to walk the streets of any capital city to notice that there are no dynamics in the economy, that our forward orientation is poor and that our outward orientation is poor. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have Australian firms and concerned Australians preparing reports for the direction the Government needs to take. Yet the Government continues to stagger on, each day dealing in this House, tragically, with things concerning WA Inc., gold taxes and so on, but failing to take any except minimal steps in the right direction to resolve the problems of Australia. When one looks at the statistics it is obvious that since 1983 there has been an expanding opportunity worldwide for Australian manufacturing exports, but we have made a declining input, a declining effort, a declining real gain in that expanding market. Other countries have taken advantage of the expanding capacities for manufacturing exports, but Australia has not. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1983-84, Australia's results and efforts have declined. Our comparison with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries-similar countries-in a number of labour market measures is poor. The use of automation is about borderline compared with other OECD countries, but we fare poorly in adjusting to economic realities. In labour absenteeism, we are seriously bad. Our acceptance of labour saving technology is bad and the adverse impact of our policies on employee turnover is also bad. </PARA>
<PARA> In very important areas of productivity, Australia is performing badly. Day after day the Government continues to endorse the attitudes of union leaders, without paying attention to the membership of unions, those people who need to bring home pay packets and who have families to support. Whilst the union leaders of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Government talk and fiddle while Australia burns, the people they claim to represent are the ones who are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the management policies in the motor vehicle industry that relate to assembly plants, the quality performance in assembly plants and the ranking Australia has with other OECD countries in manufacturing industries such as the automotive industry, one is assured that we are not doing well. </PARA>
<PARA> Our use of human resources as compared with 22 other OECD countries is also enlightening. The report prepared for the Business Council of Australia by Access Economics ranks Australia on a number of issues compared with other OECD countries. We fare quite well compared with other countries when we consider the percentage of the age group in secondary education. Australians are generally well educated compared with people in similar countries. The quality of skilled labour is good in Australia; the management use of information technology is good; employee incentives are generally better than in other comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA> But, when we look at factors that really impact on our competitiveness and our opportunity to be successful, we score really badly when we consider the availability of skilled labour, worker willingness to be flexible, vocational training adequacies, the adequacy of management training, managers' sense of drive, public education spending per capita and worker identification with corporate objectives. We fare dreadfully when we compare the Australian record with others in assessing worker identification with corporate objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these are serious areas. The Government tonight is accelerating tariff reductions. We are not opposing this, nor should we as an Opposition. Our position is sound, but I issue a plea to the Government. The Government must pay attention to what is happening in the economy-the loss of jobs, the bankruptcies, the loss of skills that is currently taking place, people fleeing industries never to return again. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a dreadful situation. The Government used the raw tool, the great waddy of cutting tariffs to force the Australian economy back into productivity. It will not work. Whitlam tried it and Malcolm Fraser tried it to some small extent, but the major reforms must be tackled and the only people in Australia willing to tackle those major reforms are the coalition parties on this side of the House-the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to support the Government's legislation, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, in its broad extent. I wish also to support the amendments to be moved by the Opposition, which highlight problems in the legislation. I also want to make some broad statements about direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an interesting time to be talking about this legislation, which results from the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and to contemplate just where it is taking us. The legislation changes various aspects of protection for agricultural products such as sugar, which are-in the broader sense of agricultural products-of interest to me in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at a situation where producers-in this case of sugar, which can compete on world markets quite effectively-are concerned about how they can operate on the domestic market. They can ship sugar out to a foreign country and meet the market. Yet the people who grow sugar in Queensland find it difficult to compete with the imported product in Sydney, their biggest market. People might say that that is impossible, that if people can win out there they must be able to win at home. They cannot, and there are two reasons, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason, which has to be addressed, is that it costs more to bring sugar down from where it is grown, hundreds of miles north of Sydney, than it does to send that same sugar halfway around the world to a foreign country. That is fundamental to what we are talking about when we say the Government should first level the playing field and address the other regulated aspects of our economy before it attacks people who are in manufacturing, tied by these problems and told to compete with the rest of the world. It is a definition of impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that those who choose to export sugar to Australia are generally those who subsidise production at home. That is an amazing situation to me. It is not suitable to apply duties. Duties are an overall protective measure primarily aimed at propping up the inefficiencies of local industry. We have things called anti-dumping duties which are notorious for not being able to operate as they are expected, but they are primarily aimed at the attitudes or policies of a business-some manufacturer in a foreign country who turns around and decides that it pays him to dump his surplus away from his own country so that it does not affect his local markets. He is prepared to take any price to keep the wheels of his manufacturing enterprise going, and he dumps it somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> Hong Kong, of course, is the willing dumping ground of many of those surpluses and people from all the way around the world go there to pick them up. It was notable not that long ago that Japanese retailers discovered they could buy Japanese cameras in New York, ship them back to Japan and make a bigger profit than buying the product locally. That sort of dumping is legislated against. </PARA>
<PARA> But then we get to the situation of actual government intervention in foreign countries, and the subsidising of production. Sugar, along with grain, is one of those that is highest on the list. The European Community has the most stupid approach by growing the product through sugar beet, which is not nearly as efficient as growing it through cane. There are even some Third World countries-and, I am told, Thailand-who choose to subsidise heavily the production of sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a simple view about this, which is that that is not a job for duties. It is a job for saying straight out to a prime minister, a president or whoever of a country, `If your policy is to subsidise production in this fashion, as a government we do not want it. There is no question of whether we will double the price that you charge by way of a duty; it is not allowed in because we have a commitment to a level playing field internationally and that is the situation. We will not do business with you'. I am sure that, if the Cairns Group were to make that an international policy when considering its problems, a few people would take notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the sugar industry-sugar is not grown in my electorate-is a classic of the problems confronting Australia. The problem confronting Australia is that, notwithstanding the many approaches to deregulation that this country has gone to in recent times, we still run a regulated labour market. We still have monopolies of labour in such important parts of the trading chain as our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I have quoted before in this Parliament the personal advice that Ralph Sarich gave to me. He said that he would never manufacture his engine in Australia-not because he could not manufacture it cheaply enough with automation or because of the problem of availability of raw materials, but because he could not guarantee getting the engines out of the country with the sorts of delays that he anticipated experiencing on our waterfront. It was not even the atrocious costs on the waterfront, but the fact that he could not know when they would get out of the country; and all his customers literally wanted deliveries every 30 minutes-and we could not offer a guarantee of 30 days in terms of reliability. That is why he went offshore; he told me that personally years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry is trying to compete with that system and being told by the Government, `We will bludgeon you into submission. You will get more efficient because we will lower your tariffs'. There is not an agricultural industry of substance in Australia that is not superefficient. As I have pointed out, the sugar industry is an example. It can already compete on export markets, but not at home. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has gone down this road time and again. Look at our currency; it floated the dollar. In itself, that was not a bad decision. it deregulated the financial system but sat at home with a regulated labour market, a centralised wage fixing system. That does not happen. It is like health that we talked about earlier today. One either has a fully regulated system or a fully deregulated system. If one tries to put the two together, it does not work. Joh Bjelke-Petersen told us that walking down a barbed wire fence with one leg each side is a painful experience. That is exactly what this Government has tried to do because it is a captive of the regulated labour sector, the industrial relations club. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to keep to the time limit because I know that other members are very keen to speak. We are looking at a level playing field under all of the coalition's policies and we are looking at ensuring that the playing field is right so that we can have what we are talking about, that is, prosperity through productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to our policies is more wages for working people, but doing things in a way that guarantees that the products that they provide will be competitive either on our local market or on international markets. We believe they should have more money. The only solution that this Government has is to screw down their wages through the regulated system and hope that one day they will produce enough at a price to make the products marketable. We believe in giving them the encouragement, the incentives through voluntary agreements, to want to produce more and to produce it cheaper. The first beneficiary of that is Mum when she pushes the shopping trolley down the street and finds the goods that her husband has manufactured are then cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) on the box, painting the picture of the sweatshop-of somebody being locked away at home with a treadle sewing machine having to turn out 10,000 pieces of clothing a day to make two quid a day. That was the picture he created. How stupid can you get? Has he ever been in a typical Australian family home recently? For instance, has he ever seen where the sewing machine might be? It seems to be out in that nice, sunny games room. I do not want to say that this is a policy of the coalition. I am just so astounded that he could not see that some women-or, for that matter, some stay at home fathers-might benefit from being able to work at home. If someone has two or three kids, and has to find 500 bucks a week to put them into the institutionalised child-care that this Government makes so much fuss about, in order to go to work to earn $300, that does not make much sense to me. That person might be able to stay at home and earn $150 and look after the kids at the same time. That is a bigger profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Somebody may be able to do very fine machine work or something and open up a niche market. I do not think anyone will ever make Levi jeans in a cottage industry, but it is possible to make other things. I give the example, silly though it may be, of racing colours, which I know are frequently made this way under contract. The people concerned are very grateful for this work because it suits them to work at home. There are computer people who want to work at home. They set their working hours and they do not have all the expenses of getting to work. Of course, they also use their own infrastructure. If there are enough of them, there is no need to build a factory. Of course, there are plenty of sewing machines, if I can use that example again, doing very little work in households and that could be doing more. I just want the honourable member for Newcastle to wake up to the fact that this is 1991. The other factor is that most of those people concerned are well educated and know their worth. But I will finish at this stage, although I am disappointed as I would like to give those opposite a few more lectures on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anyone who listens to the news or who has perhaps been taking note of the proceedings of this House would think that anything much is happening in Australia except the product of Laurie Connell's evidence before the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia. But those of us who go back to our electorates every weekend, or who leave here and talk to people in the capital cities or, as my colleagues in the National Party of Australia and I do, talk to people out in rural Australia, know that there is a very significant economic recession in place in this country. Unfortunately, it is exacerbated not just by the economic policies of this Government but by overseas markets, by the problems that drought is creating and by the total uncertainty that so many in so many industries face at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in the nature and character of the Government's dependence on monetary policy, interest rates have borne down very heavily on the pace of investment. They have certainly meant that many small businesses, and indeed many corporate enterprises, have found the pressure too great. The record number of receiverships, the record number of bankruptcies, the 48,000 jobs that have been lost in manufacturing and the hundreds of small business men and women who are going out the back door all reflect these pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell all of those who live in the cities that I do not think that people in rural Australia have ever suffered more than they are at the moment. It is not perhaps something that would strike people when they go into a country town. But there are many towns in Australia where shops are progressively closing and where businesses that used to be viable are finding that their customers are no longer there. Farmers go back to their farms, tighten their belts, stop spending and try to make do. In many instances, in spite of all the projections of economists, they will survive-but they will survive in spite of the Government not because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated the other day to see an analysis of the impact on Australian export industries of the floating of the dollar. Two conclusions seemed to me to be pertinent. The first is that the volatility of the Australian dollar since it was floated in 1983 has been far greater than it was before. The consequence has been the loss of at least 10 per cent in our margin of competitiveness, and in some instances a lot higher. </PARA>
<PARA> The floating dollar has not provided the assistance that some suggested it might. It has been offset to such a large degree for so long by the level of interest rates. This has contributed to the pace of overseas capital inflows and which has kept the dollar far higher than many believed it would have been, had the dollar been floating at the level that our trade balances would suggest. The problem is not peculiarly the product of the floating dollar; it is more the failure of infrastructure reform within the Government's policies and the total and abject failure of the accord that strikes me as being at the core of our present industry difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my problems with the four industry groups which are essentially the product of these Bills-I speak particularly about the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill-is that, while we are reducing the level of assistance to these four groups of industries, virtually nothing has been done to improve our competitiveness in goods handling, goods transport, goods storage, goods shipment and goods movement. Indeed, the Business Council of Australia has produced a list, which I find absolutely appalling, as to the level of disadvantage of Australians vis-a-vis our main competitors in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in industries such as construction, shipping, road transport and in infrastructures such as electricity supply and water. It ranges from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In other words, the cost of our operations is at least 20 per cent to 50 per cent higher than in countries such as the United States and a good deal higher than in some of the countries of Asia which are the newly emerging tigers of our region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Government is addressing how it will set what it calls a level playing field for the motor vehicle industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry, the vegetable industry and the sugar industry. It is doing that without regard to the impact of its policies on the competitive conditions within which producers in each of those industries work. My concern arises there. There is little doubt that unless the Government is prepared to accelerate its movement towards radical change in its industrial policy and unless it is prepared to adopt policies that will see us become more competitive in those infrastructures, these industries that will receive less assistance will find it harder and harder to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> I am one of those who, like several in this House, have attempted over the years to register the reason there should be a totally free marketplace and have argued within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the OECD, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and many other international agencies that the only way in which Australia and other industries, and particularly those of the newly industrialised countries, can see their living standards rise is by ensuring that tariffs, particularly agricultural protection in general, are lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that there is an advantage to Australia in reducing our tariff without at the same time getting some quid pro quo. In the present instance in the sugar industry, for example-one of the industries embraced in this package-we say to this industry that firm undertakings were given at the time we lifted the embargo, at the time we adopted the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I do not accept the contention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that all he is doing now is implementing the level of tariff that the Government said would be in place before the Government and the Opposition looked at the industry and adopted the recommendations of that Senate Committee. That report was presented in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying to the sugar industry that because we are on the altar of free trade, because we want to be able to hold our hands on our hearts and say to the Europeans, to the Americans and to the Japanese that we are acting as we believe they should act, we will be in a better position to ensure that they do so. Frankly, the reality of international politics does not work that way. Unfortunately, I believe that we are placing a number of our major industries in a position where there will be even more unemployed, where there will be an even larger number of those engaged in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry who will be shutting up plant and moving offshore and where, in the sugar industry and the vegetable industry, we will find that imports will take over their market share. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into the full detail of TCF and motor vehicles, but I suggest that, from the point of view of the alternative government of this country, we want people to know that we have a firm sight of some goalposts and by the year 2000 those goalposts will follow the stratagem that Ross Garnaut has laid down. That stratagem has as a prerequisite that those non-competitive elements in the structure of our economy must be removed first. As far as I am concerned, while we have an accord, while we have an infrastructure cost that denies competitiveness in this country, by our pulling the rug from under industry we are exacerbating the position and not creating the climate where those industries and producers can survive. That is my concern with this legislation. As I say, the goalposts in the year 2000 are one thing, but let us move towards them with confidence. Until we remove those impediments we must realise, for goodness sake, the consequences on the men, women and families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As two brief instances of the way in which competition affects us, my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) has a question on notice, question No. 711, referring to a vessel, the Hayfeng, which arrived in Australia with a cargo of 2,250 tonnes of Brazilian citrus concentrate. What will that do to the citrus industry? It is the same story with tomatoes where Italy and Spain massively support their tomato growing industries, encouraging tomato production over other crops. The consequence for Australia saw a 103 per cent increase in canned tomato imports last year. We have heard the same story about bananas and pineapples and in this legislation we are reducing the level of production available to the vegetable industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to change, as a proposed second reading amendment suggests, our anti-dumping procedures to accelerate the processes and to allow a meaningful putting in place of a level of protection to offset unfairly competitive goods, that would be a different matter. Until we do that-the Government's program does not envisage it-those industries and those producers will be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> My particular concern-I know there are time constraints-is for the sugar industry. I refer briefly to one problem that exists in northern New South Wales. I was involved in trying to ensure, with the canegrowers and producers in the north coast region of New South Wales-which, I should add, are not in my electorate; nor have I any personal interest in the area other than as a concerned Australian-effective replacement of the old CSR-owned mills by some that are owned and operated by the Sugar Milling Cooperative Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred per cent of the refinery which has been set up on the north coast of New South Wales is selling its refined sugar on the domestic market. Since April 1990 the world market price has declined from about 14c a pound to about 9c a pound. The price of refined sugar on the domestic market has fallen by approximately 30 per cent in this period, largely because of the plunge in world prices. It has also fallen-this is the point I wanted to make-to the advantage of Australian customers, by the entry of the joint venture refining company Manildra-Harwood Sugars. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with this legislation is that the investment in that area was predicated on the undertakings given by the Government, and accepted by the Opposition in 1989, which saw a schedule of assistance that would continue through to 1 July 1992. As a result of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and this Bill, that assistance will be significantly reduced. It is variously assessed that the cost will be at the rate of about $2,500 per canegrower and certainly the immediate cost will be about $16m per year of income. While I would accept that that may not be as great in total as the loss to the TCF area, in this instance the point is that the whole north coast sugar milling area is likely to collapse as a result of the change in conditions and the breaking of government word. </PARA>
<PARA> With industry policy, it is not just the policies that count; it is the consistency of those policies. When the ground rules are changed in the middle of the game, it is diabolic. What makes it worse in this instance is that the Industry Commission has already started its inquiry into the protection that is to apply to the industry post 1 July 1992. So we are in a situation where, by adopting this tariff reduction tonight, we are in fact saying to those producers, `Look, do not mind our word; we have not made a level playing field for you; we have not created a climate where you are going to be able to continue your investment; in fact, we are going to penalise you to the point where it is going to put enormous pressure on the continued viability of that whole sugar growing area'. The same applies, but to a different degree, in Queensland, where only 20 per cent of the product is sold domestically. It worries me that, in industry policy, we are inconsistent and we are not meeting the obligation we have made to the industry. It is with the intention to show my concern that I say that I believe it is really quite impossible for the industry to accept the tariff changes that are part of this Bill and part of the schedule, on which I will say something later in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which results from the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is interesting to note that there is absolutely no interest from the other side of the House. In fact, there is no-one on the benches, except the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is seated at the table. That shows perhaps the interest that the Government has in this Bill. From what I can see, the Prime Minister's statement is a series of broken promises and broken commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government certainly has recognised some of the problems confronting Australia. However one of the areas it did not address was its protection of big unions and not allowing the workers of Australia the right to earn more money, which they would have done under the proposal from this side of the House under voluntary employment agreements or enterprise based bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pertinent, I think, that I should track back to the sugar industry because, whilst I do not have any sugar in my electorate, the sugar industry is a vital part of Queensland's economy. I would just like to make comment on that in the short time I have here tonight. Back in May 1989, the Government removed the sugar embargo. The result of that is that we have unregulated domestic sugar pricing in Australia. Certainly a need was recognised to help the industry adjust to such free market conditions, and a transitional period of adjustment was seen as very necessary. The Minister at the time proceeded to implement an ad valorem tariff-that is, one adjusting to the value of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> This move was seen as inappropriate by the industry and, in fact, by this side of the House. The sugar industry certainly required some protection when prices were low but not when prices were high during this transitional period, and the ad valorem tariff rate certainly did not address this issue. If we look back at the original debate in 1989, we will notice that when the Government brought in the measure it had three speakers. The Government guillotined the debate, such was its contempt, I believe, for the sugar industry of Australia. It did not allow adequate debate at the time on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This side of the House in 1989 recognised the need to have a Senate inquiry and, as a result, one was set up. It had members from all political parties: the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party, the National Party and the Liberal Party. That inquiry came back with a recommendation for a specific duty which would be triggered when world prices were less than 12c a pound-which equates to about $250 a tonne. It said that there would be no protection at prices over $300 a tonne. There was a window in there whereby it was recognised that there was a need for some protection in this transitional period. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariffs implemented under these terms were considered by the Minister of the day to be offensive to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round. We know where GATT has gone since then-it is still talking. I sometimes wonder why we place so much credence on negotiating with GATT and coming up with something that is going to save Australia. I desperately hope that we can gain some further ground with GATT, but somehow I believe that it is going to be a lost cause. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister moved at that time to implement his own specific duty rate. He sought that, from July 1989, it would be $115 a tonne; the same would apply in 1990; in 1991, it would fall to $95; and in 1992 to $70. After a three-year period, the Industry Commission was to review the rate of protection that would apply. The Minister gave that commitment; it was an Act of Parliament. But as we can see from the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the commitment has been broken. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that under Labor Australians have come to know that all they can expect from this Government are broken promises. But let me say this: when I give my word, my word is my bond. And I would hope that this Government would take a look at what it has done. We have seen it happen so often that I think it is time for the Government, if it wants any credibility at all, to stick to the commitments it makes. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, Australian agriculture certainly acknowledges the need for reform, but it wants to see it right across the board-not just in specific areas that the Government wants to pick off. Australian agriculture is acknowledged as the most efficient in the world, and it would love to see further tariff reductions. That would certainly lower the costs on some of the imported machinery that agriculture must use and certainly on some of the imports of fertilisers that agriculture needs. The industry accepted the rules set down by the Minister, and it worked around this planned reduction in tariff rates. There was a set of goal posts, if you like, out there; there was a horizon; and the sugar industry knew that it must adjust by that date to those levels of protection. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also bear in mind that sugar cane has an 18-month growing period from the time the growers start to have input costs to the time they can receive money from that crop. So there is a big lead time before there is any income. The growers need these goal posts. The industry believed that the commitment given by the Government would enable them to shoot for that and they would be able to adjust in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in this amendment, the Government has moved unilaterally and without consultation with the industry. It has told the industry. There was no consultation to reduce the specific duty-and it is now going to reduce from $95 to $70 in 1991 and back from $70 to $55 in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has said, the Industry Commission report has certainly started work on this, and this amendment pre-empts a report which is to come before the Parliament. The way I see it now is that perhaps there is no use in that report going ahead. It has been pre-empted. It has been a waste of resources, a waste of funds. The report, due in 15 months, if it is to continue, may contain some interesting reading. There will be a loss of income to growers. The loss of income in Queensland alone in 1991, my figures show, is going to be something like $17m. In 1992 there will be $10m of lost income. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, there should not have been a decision made to accelerate the rate of tariff reform until the handing down of the Industry Commission report. That would have been the appropriate way to go and that would have been, I believe, accepted by the industry; as I said, it had these goal posts and accepted them. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Government decided to reduce tariffs in the sugar industry, it reserved its comment on the dairy and tobacco industries. Why go full steam ahead with sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment that is to be moved by our side of the House refers to anti-dumping. I will accept that in the industry statement of the Prime Minister it was acknowledged there was a problem with the anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation. It reduced the time taken from 240 days to 200 days for an industry to have a countervailing duty applied, but it did not go far enough. It recognised the problem, but was not prepared to bite the bullet. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to realise, too, in relation to sugar is that there are corrupt world trading practices and corrupt world trading prices in the so-called free market. In the limited time I have left, I wish to mention the comparative levels of subsidies for domestic consumption that exist right now. In Australia there is a comparative level of subsidy to domestic consumption which equates to 28 per cent of the price. In France it is 214 per cent, in Thailand it is 173 per cent, and in the United States of America it is 138 per cent. Of course, as I mentioned earlier all this is at a time when the GATT round of negotiations are yet to establish a firm footing. When the US has lifted its cap on export enhancement programs, this Government wants to hasten the pace of agricultural tariff reform without coupling it to labour market reform. Priority should be given to providing a more level playing field to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that there are some speakers who wish to follow behind me, so in conclusion may I say I will be supporting the amendment moved by our shadow Minister. I find that the broken promises, and the lack of acceptance by the Labor Government to address the real needs of Australia, are a disgrace. As I said, I will support the amendment to be moved by our side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining in the debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1991, I know time is short and that we are restricted in time, but I wish to take this opportunity to speak because it is evident in this legislation and the attitude of the Government towards it that it is directing Australia in a certain way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe policy-wise we could not greatly object to the manner in which this is being done, but some of us have a concern as to the appropriateness of the legislation, particularly in the light of the economic situation today within this land and particularly in the light of the opposition that Australia has in trade and the support that other countries of the world are giving not only on the dumping side but also on the tariffs that actually exist. </PARA>
<PARA> If we trace back the history of Australia, we see that undoubtedly we are dependent upon the agricultural, the mining and the manufacturing industries. I had a manufacturer say to me the other day, `I wonder whether Australia wants manufacture at all'. This is the view that is going through many industries today within Australia-whether the Government, the Opposition or we as a Parliament see Australia as a manufacturing country over the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> My mind goes back tonight to the days of, I suppose, 17 to 20 years ago when our current account fund was sound, when there was full employment within Australia. Then, of course, we had the Whitlam Administration of 1972 when a considerable amount of tariff was wiped off goods coming into Australia. The story was, `We are going to make our industries more efficient; we are going to make them very, very competitive industries'. Ever since that time this country has gone downhill. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in government we failed, over a certain number of years, to bring it back onto a proper course again. I recognise that, and it worries me now. It amazes me to find we have an economic rationale within the Government, that we see it today supporting big industry, supporting big interests throughout Australia, and we see it neglecting those three important facets of industry which I spoke about a while ago-the agricultural, the mining and the manufacturing sides. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote an interesting figure here. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, in 1973 there was total employment of 5.9 million people within Australia. Of those, 1.9 million were in the productive industries of agriculture, mining and manufacturing. The remaining 4 million were in the service industries. Today we have a total employment of 7.9 million people, of whom 1.8 million are in those three productive sectors, which is less, and 2 million more have gone to the service industries-that is, up to 6.1 million within the service industries. The productive industries that were in 1971 employing 32 per cent of the population are today employing 23 per cent of the population. That to me is proof of the direction in which this country is actually heading. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a word about the sugar industry because it is the industry that really concerns me. Like the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I am not directly financially interested; I do not have a sugar farm within my electorate. But I am concerned for the sugar industry and our primary industries generally in this country today. This Government has gone back on its word. This is the Government which committed itself-as many speakers have said-to a reduction in tariffs over a period up to the end of June 1992. Without going into figures, the legislation before the House indicates there will be a greater reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) will tell their sugar farmers? Are they going to say to them that this Government is taking $4m out of the pockets of those people? That is the amount of money this Government is taking out of the pockets of those sugar growers on the north coast of New South Wales, because it is a refined sugar area. That is the area that is producing.</PARA>
<PARA> As the right honourable member for New England has said, when I was in the New South Wales Parliament I was involved at the time that the growers themselves took over the processing plants, or the manufacturing plants, up in that area of Australia, so I am very concerned about them. That is why I wanted to speak this evening. I see great harm being done to a great industry that is efficient, that has the technology, and that has a way of harvesting which is as improved as that in any other country in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA> That total eastern coast of Australia, from Cairns down to Grafton or Coffs Harbour, is to a very great degree dependent upon the sugar industry. This is the industry which is getting hurt, and these are the people who are getting hurt. Some of these people are represented by people on the Government side of this House, and this is what actually concerns me. I challenge them to tell the truth and to go back to their electorates and say, `Righto, we know there is $4m affecting you by the legislation that is being passed'. </PARA>
<PARA> The world situation for sugar is not good simply because the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be lucky if it is able to buy any of the Cuban output this year. Therefore Cuba will be keen to sell its sugar around the world. Some form of stabilisation has always existed within the sugar industry, partly because of stabilisation on the United States and the British sides of the matter, but also because there is sugar beet and sugar cane. This is the important thing: one can store sugar but one cannot store beet. We have been fortunate to prosper with sugar, because an orderly marketing scheme for that product has always existed. It is important to realise that there has been an Australian sugar board, because of the Queensland industry, and that has given stability to the industry. If what we see today is going to repeat the attitude of the Government, I am quite sure very few of our major primary industries will have an organised marketing scheme because I do not believe the Government supports that. The Government's attitude is that we throw them out and say, `Righto, the better man wins'. Season in and season out, and market in and market out, this is not the way the primary industries of this country will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to sound the warning: while there might be some gains with a reduction of tariffs at this stage, there will be losses as far as these people are concerned. I suppose there is always criticism about the protection side of industry. I challenge the Government to tell me where any industry can gain through taking away protection with economic conditions the way they are at present? With our balance of trade problems, with our inflation rate, with our interest rates and all the other things, can any member of the Government show me where they are going to put anything into the pockets of any of the industries concerned because they take away protection? I favour taking protection away and lowering tariffs, although I favour doing that when Australia is in a position to withstand it. I hope honourable members on our side do not go too far in committing themselves, because we will get into government at the next election and that will give us a chance to really implement our good policies. Our policies are good, sound policies as far as industrial relations, the freeing up of the labour market, the waterfront and the transport industry are concerned. These are important factors, but it will take time to overcome these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to speak about the footwear, clothing and textile industries or about the motor vehicle industry, but if protection is taken away from those industries-and it is all right to say, `They are inefficient; we do not want them; let them go and let the most efficient ones survive'-what does one do with the people who lose their jobs? Are they going to go into an efficient industry? No, they will go into the service industry, which I have been telling honourable members about; they will not go into the productive industries of Australia. Let us not be afraid to give some protection to industries that are at least employing people today. Were I a manufacturer, I would not only look at the policy of the Government to see what it was going to do, but I would also examine the policy of the Opposition to see what it is going to do when it gets into government, and I would say to myself, `Righto, will it pay me to provide new equipment, to bring in efficiency and to go offshore? What shall I do?'. These are the realistic problems we have to solve in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition takes office in 2 1/2 years' time, I do not want to see Australia without a manufacturing base. This great nation of ours has all the natural resources that every country in the world would love to be blessed with. Most countries would love to be blessed with our iron ore, our mining potential and our resources and primary industries, and the knowledge that some of my colleagues have spoken about tonight. However, here we are throwing these resources down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be realistic: if one looks at the dairy industry, one finds that it is under survey by the Industry Commission at the moment, as is the vegetable industry. Were we to lower tariffs at this stage, we would not have to produce here in Australia because we will be defeated by countries which can turn the stuff out at a lower price than we can, and we will lose even those industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to sound a sincere warning. I represent the Australian people and I see problems. I want to get this country back on its proper level again: it can get there; it will get there with us, but we have to give ourselves time to implement our policies and we have to protect our industries and be sensible about it. We do not want to follow in the footsteps of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>(2) Schedule, page 4, amendments of the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977, omit proposed subsection 5 (3a) proposed to be inserted after subsection 5 (3). </PARA>
<PARA>The Government in this Bill proposes to insert six bounty Act minimums and minimum annual thresholds for payment of bounty. We now agree on one of those, and that is the third amendment this side proposed. The Government claims that the principal reason for introducing the thresholds is to promote efficient industrial development and not to make savings on bounty payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his second reading speech, says that there will be no financial impact. I can only take him at his word. Our view is that to exclude access to bounties on the basis of size is an arbitrary thing to do; certainly, it would reduce competition in the industry. We do concede, however, that there is a valid argument that industry assistance, whether through tariffs or bounties, encourages industry fragmentation. This has been one of the visible and significant costs of industry protection in this country. I suppose it is an inevitable by-product and yet another reason why industry protection should be phased out. Even though that fragmentation is undesirable, we consider it an impossible task to determine the potentially efficient manufacturers which should receive assistance and those which should not. The only solution, therefore, is to get rid of assistance gradually and transparently so that everybody knows what is happening. Essentially, this Bill does that. </PARA>
<PARA> One could ask why the Government is introducing these thresholds so late in the life of bounty schemes. Its argument would have been a little stronger a few years ago. I add that the coalition has seriously considered the arguments put by the Government, but we still consider the balance of those arguments weighs in favour of our amendments. On the surface-especially from an administrator's point of view-many small bounty payments might seem too small to be of any significance; but the danger is that we are reducing competition and starting to define who should succeed and who should not. That problem is too large to ignore, especially if new entrants are not to be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> Departmental officers have suggested to us, in some conversations that we have had with them, that these targeted small operators will continue without bounty. That suggests that they are efficient. Whilst they may not need bounty, I do not see how the introduction of thresholds can then be based on the grounds of promoting industry efficiency. As we understand the threshold mechanism, as the bounty rates fall the impact of the fixed dollar bounty thresholds will be effectively increased. For example, if a bounty rate is currently 20 per cent and the threshold is $10,000, a firm needs to generate $50,000 of eligible production costs. When the bounty rate is 10 per cent, $100,000 in costs must be generated. For smaller production units, therefore, the bounty will drop ahead of their large competitors as the bounty rates phase down. I would appreciate it if the Minister could confirm whether it is the case that effective thresholds will increase significantly as the bounty rates fall, and whether this effect is intended. We would also be interested to hear what impact the Government expects this to have on bounty recipients and future bounty payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I raise is that in the second reading speech the Minister said that there will be no financial implications. Why then is he discriminating against small businesses with these thresholds? Is this statement correct? If it is, why is he discriminating in this way?</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the bounty and capitalisation grants textile yarns matter, the minimum threshold for this bounty is to be set at $10,000 per annum. In other words, producers of eligible yarn must earn $10,000 of bounty in one year in order to get any bounty at all. If they earn $9,999, they get nothing. Until March this year the bounty rate was 42.5 per cent of value added. Therefore, to earn the $10,000 threshold the producers must add value at $23,000-odd. This bounty rate declined to 34 per cent on 1 March this year, and it pushed the level of value-added required to meet the $10,000 threshold to $29,000. That illustrates the point I made a minute ago. The same principle applies to the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977. So there are two major questions to be asked. That is one and the other is the point about cost. If, as the Minister says, there is no cost, why do we have a threshold?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is at the table, and yet in the proposals that the Government is putting to the House there appears a real penalty for those businesses that are small. There is no cost incurred by this process; the Government admits that. The second reading speech indicates that there is no financial cost to the Commonwealth. Yet the Minister appears to be penalising those that are small by removing the same access to the bounty that large producers have. We are looking at industries that are important to Australia's future. We are looking at industries, in the first instance, that generate textile yarns. If there is any area where Australia needs to become competitive, it is in the further processing of our natural products-whether it be wool or cotton or any of those products-for which we have a comparative advantage in producing worldwide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The add-on benefit to Australia's exports is significant. The bounty is gradually being phased out, but for small producers it is being phased out at a rate far faster than for large producers. Does the Minister for Small Business think that big is beautiful? His role is to represent small business. Why is he not doing so? It is his legislation. He is at the table. He should know these things. He has done nothing in the area of small business since he came to that office. Here is a simple measure which represents no cost to the Government. It would be a simple matter for him to agree to this amendment-to say that there would be no cost. He can make the decision at the table. His advisers are here. He could do it so simply. He could just get up at the end of this little debate that we are having at the committee stage and say, `Yes, the Government agrees to this proposition'. He is here to represent those people. All he has to do is nod his head and it could go quietly by. It will go to the Senate, where there will be no comment, and he will have done one small thing to support small business, at no cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> By cutting out the bounty for small business, he is denying people the opportunity to make a start in this industry. He is penalising them against the big processors. He is penalising them against making a start. It is said around Australia that it is easy to own a small business at the moment: one buys a big one, waits and Hawke will do the rest-it quickly becomes a small business. This side of the House believes that things go the other way: that we provide the climate and the environment for people to take that first step on the rung of private enterprise, and then by their own expertise and in a suitably favourable economic climate they will naturally advance and expand, particularly where we have add-on industries with added value. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area in which there are amendments is that of bed sheeting and the third is that of books. Those are small but important industries-they are potential exporting industries-and the Minister is not going to allow these small people to make a start. The Minister is apparently unconcerned about the potential for employment in these small industries. I remind the Minister, from his own famous reports-which apparently have gone for nothing since he has become a Minister-of the number of employees that small business has: the greater proportion of all employees come from small businesses. The Minister is prepared to deny the employment opportunity, the export opportunity and the entry opportunity for small businesses by these amendments that he is making to the Act. Evidently, he is not prepared to consider the perfectly reasonable proposition put to him by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member was most cautious in his representations to the Minister on behalf of small business. He put it to him gently without seeking to gain any political advantage. I am just hinting at some of the political advantage that could accrue to the Opposition unless the Minister takes that firm action. Who is going to suffer? Does the Minister know who is going to suffer by this legislation? Can he identify those regions of Australia where small manufacturers, looking for a start, will not be able to make a start, or those currently who do not have the advantage of the bounty who may seek the bounty at some future date but who will not be allowed it because of their size?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a penalty on size? What is the phobia with big things? I wonder whether the Minister has caught the disease of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)? Unless one is a big businessman or a big union, one does not rate with this Government. The Minister for Small Business should be renamed the Minister for big business, because he is associating and identifying with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in seeking to support only big businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put it to the Minister in brief terms-I have only five minutes. I hope the arguments are persuasive and compelling. It is a simple thing for the Minister at the table, with his advisers nearby, to take a simple decision on three amendments. I believe he is going to agree to one of them, so why not agree to all three? With regard to the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act and the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act, he should just say that small business ought to have a chance in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not courageous, in the terms of Sir Humphrey; it is not adventurous. It is just filling the role that he is here to play on behalf of the Government. The Minister is here to represent the needs of small business to the members of his Party-the Cabinet and the Government-and so if this matter has just gone by him perchance and he has not noticed it is going to impact on small business, simple restitution can be made here tonight. There is no effort. There is no loss. There is just a simple and practical measure he can undertake right now. It is very easy for him-just nod his head, agree with the advisers, and the matter is resolved. There is no cost to the Government. The Treasurer will not be worried by it. He will not be after the Minister; he knows there is no cost to revenue whatsoever. The Minister can do it right now-be brave and stand up for small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on this as well because the Government and the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) have quite clearly admitted their failing on the book bounty by introducing an amendment and indicating that they will omit the amendment to the Bounty (Books) Act, but they are not prepared to admit they have made errors and got it wrong in the other five areas. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who spoke before me, has spelt out the impact that this will have on small business. The Government has got it wrong. What it is doing is threatening the existence of small business in this country. The impact on business will be quite dramatic. The employment level effects in those small businesses will flow not only through the manufacturing side, but into the retailing sector as well. Already retailers throughout this country have faced the dramatic impact of the Government's economic policies in so many areas that they are going to the wall day by day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister at the table is supposedly-and I say supposedly-the Minister for Small Business. I do not think I have heard an utterance from this Minister since he took on this portfolio in defence of small business in this country. I certainly have not seen him in Victoria finding out what the problems of small business are. In my own city of Bendigo, there are 93 empty retail shops as a result of the Government's failed economic policies. What the Minister is doing by rejecting these amendments is throwing further financial and economic pressure not just on the manufacturers but on every one of those small retailers right throughout this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister to recognise that the Government has got it wrong. It has been pressed into changing its amendment to the Bounty (Books) Act-and quite rightly, because the industry would have suffered dramatically as a result of the Government's proposal. It would have had a dramatic impact on retail sales; it would have had a dramatic impact on the regional book printers who are doing the right thing by using locally made paper, trying to create work and opportunities in this country. Yet here we have a Minister who will just sit at the table and not accept what we are trying to do to help small business in this country. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really did not have any intention to rise this evening, but I listened to the comments of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and I must say I, too, have some major concerns about the way in which this issue is being handled by the Minister for Small Business and Customs. In fact, one wonders when we talk about the Minister for Small Business whether he would not be more appropriately named the Minister for a small number of businesses, because that is the direction in which we are heading in this country at the moment. The area of business in this country that is going to generate new ideas, new developments and new directions is small business. The bounty to many of those businesses will be very important. I have a great deal of difficulty understanding how we can allow a situation where businesses will be excluded from obtaining bounty because of their size. I think this really highlights the lack of understanding of this Government of the whole process of small business in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to go on at any great length this evening, but it really is important for people in this Government to understand the problems that are being faced by small businesses, the real difficulties they are facing and the obvious lack of understanding they are receiving as shown by the way the Government is presenting these issues this evening. I just hope that the Minister will reconsider and think seriously about the problems he is going to create for a number of businesses in this country, and decide whether he really wants to be the Minister for Small Business or would prefer to be known as the Minister for a small number of businesses for some time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak, especially on the ill-informed comments of a number of Opposition speakers about the impact of the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 on small business. In particular, when these announcements were shown in the industry statement, I sought some clarification of the impact on small business. I was not going to raise this matter but it has been raised by honourable members here. In fact, the thresholds have not been set at a level which discriminates against small business. For example, in the majority of these cases the bounty limit is considerably below the cost of employing one person for the whole year. In particular, the one I was concerned about was the computer bounty, and the threshold is equivalent to employing one person per year. Therefore, the Government rejects the assertion that this is discriminating against small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) got up he tried to move all six amendments at once, as he was aware. We have also circulated amendment No. (3). There is no disagreement from the Government on that because the Government has listened to the case put forward by the book bounty industry and has accepted that proposition. We have an amendment which is exactly the same as that of the honourable member for Barker. We accept that amendment and we will not oppose it. </PARA>

The logic of that is beyond description. The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) talks about one or two employees. Many small computer businesses in these high-tech industries do not have many employees. They depend on a few very skilled people. The Minister is going to mount the argument that, because there are only a couple of people involved-the Minister says only one person; I dispute that, but we will use his argument-and because the cost of administration is greater than the payout, he is going to wipe out a great cohort of small businesses from this benefit.

<PARA>I am delighted that the Government has chosen to accept this amendment, disappointed though I am that it did not accept the other amendments-the two we have voted on up until now. In the original Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill the Government proposed to increase the existing minimum from $500 per title to $2,000 per title. That would have excluded many people and many book producers from being eligible. For example, as has been alluded to earlier tonight by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), Harlequin Mills &amp;Boon pointed out that it produces many books in this country but that each title had only a modest run. As a result of these originally proposed bounty changes, no bounty would have been payable to the Book Printer in Maryborough, for instance, which generates an enormous amount of revenue for the State of Victoria. Goodness knows, that State needs some. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a most unwise original move and it led us to the conclusion that the Government, as we knew, had not given much thought to the original processes of this Bill and the contents.

Next year the bounty rate will be 14 per cent of value added production. This means that, to reach the $10,000 bounty threshold, producers will have to add value to the tune of $71,428.57, to be exact. The following year the bounty falls 2 per cent to 12 per cent and they will need $83,000-odd of value added. Two years on, the bounty will be 8 per cent, requiring value added production of $125,000, which will mean that those employees that the Minister alluded to will, as I said, be extremely expensive employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to move the amendment which has been circulated in my name but I shall speak to this matter. My concern is not peculiar to the sugar industry but to the whole breach of undertakings given by this Government in the nature of the assistance provided and its failure to address infrastructure reform, its pursuit of an accord which has failed and the implications, as I see it, in particular, for those who are producers at this time of considerable economic difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the changes introduced to the sugar industry, for example, the Commonwealth Government stated that the initial tariff rates are set to provide a similar level of support as the current import embargo under domestic price arrangements. Subsequent to the presentation of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into the sugar industry in May 1989, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) advised the industry that the new level of support should provide the industry with a sound transitional level of protection on which to base any long term adjustment which may be considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> As I remarked in my earlier comments to the House, there is no doubt that the Industry Commission report, which is now examining the future levels of assistance for the Australian sugar industry should have before it an update on the status of the industry, the impact of overseas competition and where the industry goes from here. As I explained earlier, I am worried about the plight of the Manildra Harwood Sugars Refinery, a company set up by the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-op Ltd in the electorates of Page and Richmond in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two electorates need to know that their Labor members are pursuing a course which will lead to enormous financial pressure on producers there. The probable cost of this measure will be about $4m to those producers alone; that is, apart from the $16m that the sugar industry throughout Australia will bear. I believe that the changes introduced, as they affect the sugar industry and included in the amendment to subclauses 7 to 12 in schedule 8, are such as to penalise these industries without the Government having put in place those reforms to which the debate on the second reading referred. I will not pursue the amendment but I believe that these clauses are, in fact, diabolic in their impact to producers in the area. I believe that the Government's failure to address the declining profitability of these producers is likely to have a disastrous impact on their future well-being. </PARA>

<PARA>``54</PARA>
<PARA>Goods imported under the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Import Credit Scheme, as prescribed by by-law</PARA>
<PARA>Free''. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed coalition amendment would delete the proposed introduction of a new by-law to establish the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) imports credit scheme announced in the industry statement on 12 March. We are moving that amendment because we consider that export facilitation arrangements are genuinely undesirable. They add yet another layer of distortion. They may reduce distortions in the industry between importers and exporters, but the overwhelming problem is that they exacerbate distortions between exporters in the target industry and exporters in other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Industry Commission opposes such schemes in principle. Everybody now agrees that the major cost of import protection is an effective tax imposed on exporters. Exporters are not only forced to pay higher prices for protected inputs but are more concerned that they will be compelled to pay higher prices for factors of production, such as labour and capital, the prices of which are bid up by other sectors. The only real solution is the one that, I think, in general we are all agreed; that is, to get rid of import protection. This process is now under way in a bipartisan fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Others suggest other forms of tariff compensation. It is in this light that the TCF import credit scheme is a halfway house. Import protection is coming down in industry but obviously the Government feels this is not enough. Therefore, it is imposing a sort of half-baked scheme which will allow exporters initially to earn import credits to the value of 30c for every dollar, which will phase down to 15c. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, fortunately, a more modest facilitation scheme than that in the car industry. As I mentioned in the debate in the second reading stage, much has been made of the Industry Commission's recommendation to continue export facilitation in that industry. We agree that it should continue, not because we agree with the principle but because it is there and it will fall as protection in that industry comes down. We agree with the Commission, which summed it up by saying that it does not view export facilitation as a desirable policy instrument in its own right. It suggested that the cost of tariff protection to exporters and others is best addressed by focusing on reducing that protection as part of the broader program of micro-economic reform. We can only say hear, hear. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, the coalition will move to oppose the establishment of the TCF imports credit scheme. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) A draft resolution, proposed by Sweden, entitled ``Respect for the will of the people of Myanmar'' was tabled at the 45th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 45) on 19 November 1990, in the Third Committee under agenda item 110 Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Periodic and Genuine Elections. The draft was sponsored by Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The text of the draft resolution is attached.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The draft resolution was not considered by UNGA 45, but was deferred for consideration by UNGA 46 when a motion of deferral was proposed by the Japanese delegation and adopted without a vote on 29 November 1990. As it was not put to a vote the Government is unable to state whether or not the draft resolution would have been supported by China or Singapore, although the Japanese delegation indicated that Japan would have voted in favour of the draft resolution had it been voted on by UNGA 45.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The possibilities for action on Burma at UNGA 45, together with other matters of mutual interest were discussed between Australia and Japan at pre-UNGA consultations in 1990 in Canberra. It is hoped that similar consultations will be held between Australia and Japan prior to UNGA 46, but arrangements for this have not yet been made. If these consultations take place, the situation in Burma and possible action at UNGA 46 is likely to be discussed. The Government will also consider the possibility of discussing this issue prior to UNGA 46 with other neighbouring states in preparation for this session.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The question of the situation of human rights in Burma was on the agenda of the 46th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) which met in Geneva between late January and early March 1991, and was considered by the Commission under its ``confidential'' (ECOSOC Resolution 1503) procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable Member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Although restrictions remain on freedom of speech and freedom of association, there has been a discernible improvement in the human rights situation since June 1989 in China, including the lifting in 1990 of martial law in Beijing and Lhasa, the release of a large number of dissidents held after June 1989, and the more lenient than expected sentences handed down in the recent trials of student leaders in China. In any event, the Australian Government's relationship with China is broadly based, and the human rights situation was only one factor taken into account in the decision to lift the remaining restrictions. Other factors were important, including the attitude of other countries towards China, and the Government's view that there was diminishing value in continuing to constrain the Australian relationship towards China to a markedly lower level than those of other like-minded countries and our regional partners. The Government's policy will continue to be based on keeping open as many channels of communication as possible in order to encourage policies of reform and liberalisation in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Government has acknowledged the substantial progress made by the Government of South Africa toward the dismantling of apartheid, but recognizes the need for continued efforts to be made toward reform and major constitutional change. Sanctions have been crucial in bringing about the changes which have occurred to date and will continue to be crucial if the destruction of apartheid is to be ultimately assured. In this context, the 16 February 1991 meeting of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa (CFMSA) accepted an Australian proposal for the adoption of a phased approach to the lifting of sanctions, with movement on specific measures linked to particular milestones in the dismantling of apartheid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The book ``Apartheid and International Finance'' by Tony Cole and Keith Ovenden does not state that ``the aim of sanctions was to achieve rapidly increasing black unemployment and a security problem which would require higher levels of Government expenditure.'' As explained in its introduction, the book is in fact a product of the Commonwealth's commitment to peaceful change in South Africa. The Australian Government has made it clear that the purpose of sanctions is not punitive, but to bring the South African Government to the negotiating table and to keep it there until fundamental change has been secured. Sanctions have been crucial in bringing about the changes which have occurred to date, and will go on being crucial if the destruction of apartheid is to be assured.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a &amp;b) For some years the EC has maintained a high level dialogue with the PLO through the Presidency or the Troika. This was the situation in June 1990. On 4 February 1991 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the twelve EC states met in Brussels and agreed to suspend this contact because of the support given to Saddam Hussein by the Chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat. This decision was reaffirmed in a statement by the Luxembourg Presidency of the EC on 26 February. While the EC decision does not refer to bilateral contacts between the PLO and individual member states there have been, as far as we are aware, no ministerial level meetings since the issuing of the Presidency statement.</PARA>
<PARA> There has apparently been no change since June 1990 in attitudes of individual member states to PLO offices located in their capitals. We understand these attitudes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Belgium</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO information office in Brussels has no official status, privileges or immunity. The office director does, however, have personal diplomatic status as a member of the staff of the Mauritanian Embassy. The Foreign Ministry has a direct dialogue with the office.</PARA>
<PARA>Denmark</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO information office in Copenhagen has no official status, privileges or immunity. The Danish Foreign Ministry has a direct dialogue with the office.</PARA>
<PARA>France</PARA>
<PARA> France up-graded the then PLO liaison and information office in Paris to the status of a ``General Delegation of Palestine'' in January 1989. The Delegation has official rather than diplomatic status. The French Government maintains regular contact with the PLO through the office in Paris.</PARA>
<PARA>Germany</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO information office in Bonn does not have official status. The PLO office has regular access to Foreign Ministry officials at senior working level and the Ambassador and staff at the German Embassy in Tunis maintain contact with officials at PLO headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA>Greece</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1990 the PLO office in Athens was up-graded to the ``Diplomatic Representation of Palestine'' and extended full diplomatic status and privileges. The PLO representative was retitled as the Palestinian Ambassador. The Greek Government maintains contact with the PLO representation.</PARA>
<PARA>Ireland</PARA>
<PARA> A Palestine information office, staffed by Irish citizens, was established in Dublin in 1985. It has no official status. The PLO office in the Hague was unilaterally ``accredited'' to Ireland. PLO representatives have access to middle ranking Foreign Ministry officials.</PARA>
<PARA>Italy</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO office in Rome is known as the ``Palestine General Delegation'' and although without full diplomatic status it does have some privileges and immunities. The PLO office has regular access to officers in the Foreign Ministry.</PARA>
<PARA>Luxembourg</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO does not have a resident office in Luxembourg and business is carried out by the PLO representative in Brussels. The Brussels office remains in regular contact with Luxembourg Foreign Ministry officials.</PARA>
<PARA>The Netherlands</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO information office in the Hague has no official or diplomatic status or privileges. The Government of the Netherlands maintains routine contact with PLO representatives through the Foreign Ministry in The Hague and through the Embassy in Tunis.</PARA>
<PARA>Portugal</PARA>
<PARA> The resident PLO office in Lisbon has some privileges although less than diplomatic status. Officials at the PLO office in Lisbon have open access to Foreign Ministry Officials.</PARA>
<PARA>Spain</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO office in Madrid has an official status just below that of an Embassy with some privileges and immunities. The Spanish Foreign Ministry maintains a regular dialogue with the office.</PARA>
<PARA>The United Kingdom</PARA>
<PARA> The PLO information office in London has no official status or privileges. Official level contact is maintained with the office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The 1991 bipartisan mission to Washington held six meetings with US Congressional Representatives and Senators and their key staffers.</PARA>

<PARA> - Dr Richard Crowder, Under Secretary for International Affairs and Commodity Programs, US Department of Agriculture;</PARA>
<PARA> - Mr Eugene McAllister, Acting Under Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs, US Department of State.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) An officer dedicated to congressional liaison, Minister (Congressional Liaison), was first appointed to the Embassy in Washington in March 1987. In August 1988, an internal reorganisation within the Embassy brought together under the same office the congressional liaison and public affairs functions, headed by the Minister (Congressional Liaison and Public Affairs).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (b) The position has been based in Washington since its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) See 3 above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (b) and 5</PARA>
<PARA> Congressional liaison has both a lobbying component sensitising members of Congress to Australia's priorities and needs-and an interpretive component-analysing how our Australian concerns can be brought to interact with and affect the legislative priorities of the Congress. An example of the latter, bearing on urban concerns, is a current project in which the Embassy is analysing the extent to which high food prices for urban consumers in the United States are likely to affect Congressional consideration of such questions as agricultural subsidies and the Export Enhancement Program in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Congressional Liaison function therefore requires the maintenance of contact with members of the Congress in both Washington and their constituencies. This can involve visits to various States and electoral districts, and discussions with Senators and Representatives in forums where Australian concerns can be related directly to local priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The special nature of the United States Government, with its separation of powers between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, makes it essential that the Australian Government maintain a strong capacity to bring Australian priorities, especially as exhibited through the Parliament, to the attention of legislators and the committees on which they serve. The activities of the Office of Congressional Liaison and Public Affairs in the Australian Embassy in Washington directly contribute to meeting these objectives.</PARA>
