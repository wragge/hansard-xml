<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the Minister aware of proposals for reducing government expenditure by reducing outlays on the unemployed? How feasible are such proposals and what would be the consequences of implementing them?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="977" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In response to the question by the honourable member for Parramatta, yes, I am aware of Opposition proposals, in the Economic Action Plan of October 1989, to cut government expenditure by $3 billion; of course, a large part of that cut was to be achieved by attacking the unemployed. An amount of $1.1 billion of that $3 billion was to be achieved by attacks on the unemployed. The centrepiece was the ending of benefits after nine months, which was to give gross savings of $1,500 million, but since the Opposition allowed for some proportion to go onto special benefit the net saving was $665m. The actual proportion that would be allowed to go onto special benefit would be just over half of those unemployed for nine months or more--56 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition calculated that 44 per cent of the long term unemployed--those unemployed for nine months or more--would be taken off unemployment benefit and given no entitlement to special benefit. Therefore, 44 per cent would have no benefit, even though they might be desperately seeking work and might have fulfilled all their obligations under the work tests. Of course, that is an incredibly harsh policy, which the Opposition has recently been trying to pretend is something less harsh than it really is. It has talked about special benefits as the safety net, but since its costings indicate that almost half of the unemployed for nine months or more would not be covered by that safety net then obviously the policy remains a very difficult one for the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>  The latest step in the attempts by the Opposition to wriggle out of this is to suggest that in fact there is something beyond special benefits. Yesterday on the 7.30 Report the Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA>We're not going to leave people beyond the safety net, completely; that's never been the policy of John Hewson or Tim Fischer. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what Tim Fischer has in mind, but I am pretty sure of what John Hewson has in mind--it is, in fact, to leave them beyond the safety net.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The second leg of this attempt by the Opposition to wriggle off the hook is to say that, beyond special benefits, retraining would be available. When asked what was the point of tipping people off the dole, the Leader of the National Party said it was a circumstance of encouraging people into retraining and other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact is that the Economic Action Plan proposed a lot less retraining and places for training because $200m of the savings were to come out of labour market programs which at that time represented about a 60 per cent cut in the amount allocated for labour market programs. Those opposite will have $200m less with which to provide training and retraining places for people who are taken off the dole than existed in 1989-90. But in this Budget we have proposed an additional $200m which those opposite have already said that they oppose. They oppose that $200m for retraining and training places and they would take another $200m away and then say, `But don't worry unemployed, you have lost your unemployment benefits but there are retraining places'. There would be about a third the number of places that the Government is now proposing to have.</PARA>
<PARA>  What a ludicrous position it is for the Opposition to suggest that there is some kind of protective policy by offering retraining places. They simply would not exist under the Opposition's policy. A safety net with special benefits is itself a fairly precarious safety net. Under special benefits, there is no entitlement to any particular amount of money; it is a discretionary payment by the Department of Social Security. The maximum a person can get is what he or she would be entitled to under the unemployment benefit. In fact, that amount can be reduced by all sorts of circumstances: any money earned goes off dollar for dollar;  any cash that a person might have can be taken into account in terms of a very tight liquid assets test; any assistance that a person gets from family or friends is taken into account and so on. So it is a safety net of sorts for those who are able to access it, but it is certainly not a generous safety net by any means.</PARA>
<PARA>  Most importantly, what this demonstrates is that a far better way of reducing expenditure on unemployment benefits, rather than attacking the unemployed, is to reduce the number of unemployed by getting people back into employment. Government economic policies will restore employment growth in the course of this year. Certainly, on the face of the Budget figures, we see zero growth in employment through this year-- from the beginning to the end. But in fact what that hides is that in the first half of the year we expected employment to decline a bit over one per cent--most of which has occurred already in July--and employment growth, in the second half of the year, by 1 1/4 per cent. So in the second half of this financial year we will be back into employment growth. Employment growth of 1 1/4 per cent represents almost 100,000 jobs in six months. So in the course of 1992 it is reasonable to expect that we could be back to employment growth in the order of nearly 200,000 jobs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My opinions are factual. I will start at the beginning. The Government introduced a capital gains tax because real capital gains are income. If dividends are taxed and if interest is taxed, capital gains should be taxed. As honourable members know, ownership of capital is heavily concentrated in the hands of the higher income groups. In fact, fewer than 2 per cent of taxpayers pay capital gains tax and the latest available figures on the $631m that was collected show that 60 per cent came from taxpayers with incomes over $50,000 per annum and 40 per cent came from companies. Now, non-taxation of capital gains under the coalition for all those years it was in government led to inefficient economic decisions with respect to investment, because investment was channelled into assets offering returns in the form of capital gains rather than income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Flinders interjects, but by way of comparison I must inform the honourable gentleman that the Opposition wants to replace the eminently fair capital gains tax of the Government with a so-called speculative gains tax. I am not sure why it is called a speculative gains tax, unless it is because it would encourage asset speculation. Is that why it is called `speculative gains tax'? It is fair to say, from the little bit of detail that we know of the Opposition's proposed speculative gains tax, that it would offend every tax policy principle.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-First of all, it primarily benefits high income taxpayers. Secondly, it would provide an incentive to invest in assets offering returns in the form of capital gains rather than taxable income streams and this would tend to bias the allocation of resources to speculative rather than productive investment. The ideological loons of the Opposition would reintroduce a structural defect into the whole taxation system--into the income tax. It would herald the return of the days--as the honourable members for Bennelong and Wentworth well understand--of tax avoidance arrangements, because those arrangements flourished under those two honourable gentlemen. Depending on the design details--and once again the Opposition is rather short on detail--there will be incentive to sell assets held for the five-year qualifying period, and that would drive asset prices down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A speculative gains tax would also encourage negative gearing schemes.  The community would subsidise speculators' costs of acquiring and maintaining an asset but would have no claim on speculators' gains. That is a clear tax non-neutrality.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Bennelong is an expert on tax avoidance schemes and all that. There are three potential revenue costs of a speculative gains tax:  a direct cost of capital gains tax lost, because the disposal would no longer be taxed;  the cost of the erosion of the income tax base; and a substantial cost associated with the behavioural response of investors as they off- load assets in the expectation that a future government might reintroduce a capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Not even in the narrow computer driven world that the Leader of the Opposition seems to live in would such a proposal be given any credence. It is a sop to some of the constituents of honourable members opposite who want a free ride on the backs of ordinary Australians. I do not know whether it will be 25 September or 25 December, but we hear that we will be getting some details. On 25 September at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition has to answer at least three questions: what programs will be slashed in order to fund the abolition of $700m worth of capital gains tax revenue; secondly, what level of tax avoidance will the Liberals condone as income is taken tax free as capital gains; and, thirdly, how can the Opposition credibly argue on tax when it intends to gut a central element of a fair and efficient system that we have now?  Of course the Leader of the Opposition will not answer those questions, because he cannot.</PARA>

There has never been any doubt about the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Australian Olympic team is well prepared and outfitted for Barcelona. The Government has already committed $8.5m towards the cost of the Australian team's participation in the Olympic Games of 1992. Some $7m of this has been committed for preparation of the team and $1.5m for transporting and outfitting team members. I am pleased to be able to confirm today that an additional $1.5m will be provided for the transportation and outfitting of the Australian team. There has never been any doubt about this. What had to be finalised was the way in which that money was to be found. The amounts will be met without adversely affecting any existing sports programs. This will bring the total Commonwealth commitment to the 1992 summer and winter Olympic Games to $10m. This represents a substantial increase over previous government funding for Games teams. It is in line with our commitment to sport as demonstrated by a doubling in sports funding over the last three years. I again thank the honourable member for his question.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is out in the ether. Would it not be good to know the nature of the discussion which led to the blackguarding of the Sydney Morning Herald bureau chief?  I say all that in parenthesis because I do not anticipate that the tape-recording of that particular meeting will be released for all the rest of us to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let me take up the point made in the honourable member's question, because she raises a very valid point. In the debate on micro-economic reform in this country, we are getting very used to the Opposition Leader going around the place producing a taxonomy of propositions without explanation, rather like a Christmas carol--12 lords a leaping, 10 cows a mooing, and nine gold Ian Sinclairs. He comes out with a proposition that says, `Put us in and we will have lower air fares, lower communications charges, and lower transport costs'. That was the line he pursued, both in his answer to the Budget Speech and in his performance on Four Corners recently.</PARA>
<PARA>  One area where his consumption taxes will apply will be to massively add to air fares a problem which we have manifestly solved. Because we now have deregulated air fares, we virtually have to take statistics on a daily basis. Let us take some representative statistics of some discounts offered in the last months--Sydney-Perth, a 68 per cent discount; Melbourne-Perth, a 69 per cent discount; and Sydney-Adelaide, a 62 per cent discount.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and relates to the recent Budget statement that the sales tax exemption will be extended to vehicles used for the transportation of a passenger with a disability. I ask: can the Minister outline the benefits of this initiative for people who are disabled?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="983" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Obviously, the initiative is one which is of great significance both to people with disabilities and to their carers. Previously, sales tax exemption was available only to disabled drivers. It will now apply also to the modification of a vehicle used principally to transport a passenger with a disability. This initiative builds on the wide range of equity measures introduced by the Government for people with disabilities, as outlined in my ministerial statement last Thursday. It is consistent with the Government's emphasis on labour force participation and recognises that costs associated with disability are a very significant factor or barrier to labour force participation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government has previously addressed the issue of additional costs by signing the Florence agreement last year, which had the effect of removing tariffs on educational, scientific and cultural goods especially designed for people with disability, thereby enabling access to a wide range of imported aids and appliances at a reduced cost. These measures and the approach have enjoyed bipartisan support on the part of the Opposition, and I note that the Opposition spokesman in this area has referred to their bipartisan, non-political character in relation to values to do with fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that the Opposition spokesman in that context also referred to the fairness of replacing existing wholesale sales tax provisions with a goods and services tax. One wonders how fair that would be. Certainly it would not be fairer for people with disability, who under those circumstances would be required to pay an additional 15 per cent or 22 per cent--which is it?--for a vehicle. But it may be fairer, of course, for those people such as one who might be described as the boy from Bellevue Hill, who is presently required to pay a wholesale sales tax of 30 per cent on his next Ferrari but would have his tax liability reduced by half if a 15 per cent goods and services tax were introduced. If I could quantify, to take the example of a not unusual vehicle for people with disabilities--a newly modified vehicle for a person with disability under the coalition Government would no longer cost on average $35,000 but $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have been doing a bit of research and I am able to also quantify another comparison, which I am sure will interest honourable members. A middle range Ferrari--and I am told that Ferraris range from something like $200,000 to $600,000--would be $37,500 less.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is $250,000 minus 15 per cent if the present 30 per cent wholesale sales tax were replaced by a 15 per cent consumption tax, and that amount is more than the amount paid by the person with a disability to purchase a vehicle and would go straight into the bottomless pit of what one might describe as conspicuous consumption. If the Opposition's amendment was accepted, the result would be a massive increase in the tax burden on people with disabilities, not to mention superannuants, people on workers compensation, pensioners, beneficiaries and families. It would ensure that a person with disability remained wholly dependent on social security and was unable to make a transition into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is a contrast--not simply a contrast about two different types of cars, but a contrast between two different approaches to policy. On the one hand, there is the removal of the impost of a tax to provide an incentive to people to move back into the work force and be able to sustain themselves; on the other, there is a change in relation to a tax regime which would benefit the wealthy to an extent that effectively might have helped to pay for concessions needed to help those most disadvantaged.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I recognise at the outset that there is some concern within our society about the levels of foreign investment, particularly in the tourism industry. It was for that reason that I instructed my Department late last year to carry out some research into this topic so that we could perhaps have a much more enlightened debate on the role of foreign investment in the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The report which I jointly released on 22 July in conjunction with the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, successfully refutes a great deal of the hearsay that is associated with the impacts of foreign investment within the tourism industry. In the absence of a lot of that reliable industry information in the past, critics of foreign investment within the tourism industry have claimed that it has been of little economic benefit to this country, as most of the profits were repatriated to the country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA>  A report that was the subject of this particular study involved a number of case studies, including the Cairns region, the Gold Coast and Sydney. It found that foreign investment actually produced net economic benefits for Australia with a very minimal leakage of profits overseas. The main reason for the very large retention of economic gains is the fact that most of the inputs used in foreign owned facilities are in fact sourced within this country. In other words, there is predominantly local employment and local purchases of goods and services used in those foreign owned facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  To illustrate the economic impacts, the report suggested that as little as 4 per cent of expenditure on a representative tour package actually flows out of the country owing to foreign ownership after one deducts the point of sale outlays for package tours and for prepaid components. Importantly, this country and the tourism industry have benefited very significantly from the influx of foreign investment, which has increased the range of facilities available both to our overseas visitors and of course to the important domestic market, thus enhancing our capacity to create many new jobs for our people.</PARA>
<PARA>  The development of a very diverse tourism infrastructure is clearly critical to the successful growth of this important industry. Accordingly, the Government remains firmly committed to encouraging overseas investment in the tourism industry, in accordance, of course, with the national interest guidelines. That particular policy applies to all foreign investors. As the Minister for Transport and Communications suggested a few minutes ago, international tourism to Australia generated in the order of $7 billion. That accounts for about 10 per cent of Australia's total export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>  That figure will increase because the Australian Tourist Commission has in place a plan to increase our current level of international visitor arrivals from some 2.2 million to somewhere of the order of five million to six million at the end of this decade. So, given this, tourism is poised to play a very important role in the Australian economy, especially in the area of job creation. Therefore, foreign investment is very important if we are to achieve this great target.</PARA>

<PARA>  Most thinking people in the Australian community are fully aware of the inequities of the Common Agricultural Policy and the impact that it has on Australian farmers. It is important that we make an even bigger effort than we have in the past to point out to ordinary Europeans the cost of that policy to them.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will point out a few things mentioned in the pamphlet. It shows that consumers in the European Community pay between 19 per cent and 52 per cent more for food--depending on the size of their income--as a result of the policy. Taxpayers in Europe pay up to 27 per cent more because of the subsidies they have to subscribe to for this policy. Indeed, as this pamphlet points out, since the middle 1980s 70 per cent of the budget of the European Community has gone to agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA>  It also points out--and this is what the farmers of Europe need to take notice of--that 80 per cent of those subsidies goes to 20 per cent of the farmers. That is, the big farmers in Europe are the overwhelming beneficiaries of this misguided policy. In fact, when one looks at that group of wealthy farmers, one sees that they get in subsidies alone 50 per cent more than the total income of the average European family. These are the truths that we want to bring home to Europeans.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very pleased, as I have no doubt all honourable members of this House would be, that the difficult political situation which had existed in Vanuatu for some weeks has now been resolved constitutionally and in accordance with Vanuatu's legal and parliamentary procedures. The manner of the transfer of power from the previous Prime Minister strengthens the institutions of democratic and parliamentary government in that place. I believe that it is a good example--which all honourable members of this place would welcome--of stability and constitutional government in practice in the South Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I welcome the election of Donald Kalpokas as Prime Minister. He was a founding member of the Vanua'aku Pati, as I think you know, Mr Speaker. He has had many years experience as a Minister. He has been a frequent visitor to Australia and many people in this country have good relations with him. I certainly look forward to meeting him soon--perhaps he will be at CHOGM; I think he will be--and having the opportunity of discussing issues of mutual interest with him.</PARA>
<PARA>  I also congratulate Father Walter Lini for the very considerable contribution which he has undoubtedly made to the development of his country's nationhood and, beyond Vanuatu, the contribution he has made to the development of regional nationalism. Following the vote, I sent messages to both the new Prime Minister and Father Lini reaffirming the constructive support of Australia for Vanuatu and its development. As you know, Mr Speaker, we in this country enjoy very strong relations with Vanuatu in the areas of economic relations, aid, defence cooperation and tourism. I and the Government look forward to a very close and productive working relationship with the new Government of Vanuatu.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories no longer possesses the confidence of this House. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because what has been demonstrated in Question Time today is that on this issue the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is too terrified to tell the truth and to clarify a situation that could be clarified very simply. I remind the House that the circumstances which give rise to this dispute are not circumstances where there has been some political accusation by members of the Opposition; the circumstances are that there have been accusations from leaders of the environmental movement who met with the Minister and who, not together but separately, advised the press of an outcome which is totally contrary to the situation which has been described by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister's accusers in this matter are not the Opposition but those people who put forward a version of what happened which is quite contrary to what the Minister has told this House and apparently told the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The accusers, the people who have given their version, are the Director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, Miss Rachel Siewert; the Director of the Conservation Council of South-East region and Canberra, Mr Rodney Falconer; and the National Liaison Officer for the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Paul Rutherford. Notwithstanding that the Minister has, since that time, come out and issued a clear denial of what they have said, and has given a totally different version of the conversations which took place, the fact is that two of those three people have reaffirmed in the clearest possible terms that the Minister was bagging not the States, as she has claimed, but the Prime Minister and his political process which was aimed at bringing a more rational form of federalism into this country. That is the point of dispute and they are the disputing parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we had merely a conflict between two people, if we had a situation where a Minister of this House were being denied by a member of the Australian public or another member of this Parliament, one might be left in a position of doubt. Here we have a situation where the Minister is denied, not once but thrice, and of course the whole thing is given great force by the reality that the solution lies but a tape-recorder away. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple fact is that we need have taken no parliamentary time on this issue at all. The Minister knows that the participants in this meeting have absolutely no objection to the release of this information, to the release of this record. There are three versions against the Minister's version. She has the tape- recording and the simple reality is that she has the straightforward immediate capacity to lay the ghost of this dispute. Her behaviour in this chamber is simply not consistent with that of a truthful Minister. Her behaviour is only consistent with somebody who is forced to cover up and is not prepared to disclose the record for public viewing. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no ground of privacy to protect this conversation because the other participants are willing to see the tape released. The position was summed up by the Courier-Mail in one of its leading articles only this morning:</PARA>
<PARA>  In these circumstances, Mrs Kelly has the means immediately to hand by which she can easily put to rest any doubts about what she said, and to whom. Why won't she?</PARA>
<PARA>There is a second element to this lack of confidence in this Minister. It is the peculiar responsibility of this House to test the matter, because what is quite clear again from today's Question Time is that the Prime Minister is not prepared to test this matter. The Prime Minister is terrified of the truth. The Prime Minister is a man who talks tough about disciplining his Ministers; the Prime Minister is a man who has put up with having his tail tweaked over and over again by Dawkins and others; the Prime Minister is a man who makes mealy-mouthed statements----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-And, as the honourable member says, he will be forced to make a decision. The facts allow only one interpretation. The basic facts in this matter are that there is a tape-recording of a meeting in which the Minister is alleged to have attacked a significant area of Government policy and cast aspersions on the Prime Minister himself and that that recording is being kept away from the Parliament and the public because the Minister is simply not game enough to face it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us put this debate in the context of the Minister's entire administration of the environment portfolio--indeed, in the context of this Government's administration of the environment portfolio. If the Minister is remembered for anything with regard to her administration of this portfolio, it will be that she used those words `crass politics'. Those words sum up completely the attitude of this Government to the whole environment issue. It has been crass politics from 1983 on. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not have time in this debate to canvass the whole of the Government's record with respect to the environment--whether it was under Senator Richardson, the current Minister, or Mr Cohen. But the fact of the matter is that, if we go right back to the beginning of this Government to things such as the three-mines uranium policy, we see nothing but the most shameful lack of principle and double dealing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We face people like the honourable member for Banks from the Left who is probably very unhappy about the idea that we should mine uranium. Where were the lions of the Left in the Labor Party when one of the largest uranium mines in the world was opened in South Australia in order to meet the electoral requirements of the Labor Party in South Australia? That is absolutely typical of the approach which has been adopted by the Labor Party with respect to environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This has continued through to the present day, and the latest and most shameful example was of course the issue of Coronation Hill. Any honest person would have said that the environmental requirements of that mine had been met and that the environmental issues would not stop that vital development, and yet the Government knocked that on the head on the basis of views on Aboriginal affairs which were not accepted by two-thirds of the Cabinet and which were not accepted by a most experienced member of the Government, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins. In his public statements, Senator Collins made quite clear the sort of games which were being played with respect to uranium policy and the total failure of this Government to live up to its absolute responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we go to the report of the meeting which has caused this problem, we find that it is stated clearly in that report--and the three sources of it are set out--that the minutes taken by the conservationists at the meeting with the Minister show that she criticised the much vaunted new federalism as `crass politics' which came down to trading in powers between Federal and State governments. It is clear that all of the conservation leaders left the meeting with that impression as to what was being done. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before, since we have the capacity to put the record straight immediately, I again say to the Minister that the only way she can have the confidence of this House is if she produces this tape and actually shows in a clear way what was said and done at that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have talked about the environmental policy context in which this is taking place. Let us also remember that this situation is occurring at a time when the Australian economy is in a complete shambles. In my State of Western Australia we have one in nine people unemployed. In my State and throughout Australia we have one in three young Australians unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Banks is typical of the people who have remained silent in the face of Labor Government policies that they would have criticised to the death if they were carried out by a Liberal and National Party government. The honourable member for Banks is typical of the people who have sold out the working people of Australia in the name of issues which they do not understand. The honourable member for Banks should remember the people who sat in the visitors' gallery and listened to his maiden speech when he made a plea for them. They applauded him. They would not be in the gallery applauding him now when he defends this ham-fisted Minister and her abuse of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I ask the House to remember not only that there are one million unemployed, but also that we have a balance of payments problem of between $15 billion and $20 billion, with no sign of improvement. We have an international debt problem of $140 billion plus, and all of this is contributed to by an approach to the administration of the environment policy which shows a shameful lack of regard for the real problems of the Australian people. The Prime Minister is not in the chamber today; if he were, he could confirm his statement of 1987. Do honourable members remember what the Prime Minister said in 1987 about the great prospects for Australia? It was a very simple statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We export a lot of woodchips. We could invest $3 billion in this country and improve our balance of payments by $1 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA>That was what the Prime Minister, along with Senator Button, was promising in 1987. We find statements by the Prime Minister and Senator Button being made right through 1987 and 1988 promising the prospect of new jobs through new investment in this country by adding value to our basic resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  We all know what happened in Wesley Vale. Wesley Vale was a total failure of Government policy because it represented a failure of the Government to bring together its environment and business or investment policies in a rational way. Who is the authority for that? I ask the House to remember who is the authority for that failure of government. It was the then President of the ACTU, the man who is now a Minister in the Hawke Government, who made it absolutely clear when Wesley Vale fell to the ground that that debacle lay at the feet of the Hawke Government and its failure to bring together its environmental and economic policies. That is what has gone wrong with this country. We have a Government which in no sense looks to the national interest or to the holistic situation. It simply falls into small warring camps. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last time we discussed the environment we had the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who has just left the chamber, sitting with Minister Kelly. Does any honourable member on the Labor side deny, with respect to fundamental policies being put forward by this Government on the environment and resource security, that those two Ministers have been, along with their departments, fighting like Kilkenny cats? How can we have any confidence in this administration of the environment portfolio when there is still no sign of the legislation that is required to carry out the Prime Minister's promise of resource security?</PARA>
<PARA>  If honourable members want an example of how this Government has allowed the politics of situations to override the substance and the solving of problems that are required if we are to create jobs in Australia, they should look at resource security. It is notorious in the community; it is notorious in the industry; and it is notorious among the Greens that the Department of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is fighting with the Department of the Minister for Resources. They do not know--nobody knows--what the outcome of that will be. This is happening at a time when thousands of Australians--almost one million--are out of work and one in three young Australians are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the administration of the Minister with respect to an environmental protection authority. We have been talking about an environmental protection authority for the last year. The Minister has made announcements about it. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is presently at the table, has told us that there will be legislation for an environmental protection authority. If honourable members go away and look at the examination of the Minister's Department in the Senate Estimates Committee, they will find the head of her Department expressing complete surprise--indeed, complete ignorance--about the prospect of legislation being introduced. The situation is that this is a complete farce; it is a complete breakdown in any sort of orderly administration; and there is no hope that we are going to get a break from our present situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will go back to the situation with respect to the Minister's attack on either the process of the State governments' participation in new federalism or to the attack on new federalism itself. Which version we are going to accept is, of course, a matter of whether we accept the views of the environmentalists or the views of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will return to the subject matter of the debate. The administration of the Minister's department is pathetically hopeless. If we look at the work on the EPA or at the work on the economically sustainable development process, we see millions of dollars of government expenditure without the hope of any finite conclusions to solve the dilemma of development and environment protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Again, there is a total lack of government direction. What this Minister has totally failed to do, and what the Government has totally failed to do, is to indicate in any sense what the Government's objectives are--whether they are environmental objectives or objectives in respect of the economy. It is not a matter of command or a requirement on the ecologically sustainable development process that we should acknowledge the need for investment in Australia, the need for resource development, the need for value adding and the need for all of those things which will give some hope to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is it that the Minister is accusing the Government of indulging in crass politics with? Perhaps it is one of the few things that the Government is currently doing that might be regarded as constructive. I remind you, Mr Speaker, that before the election the great difference which was alleged to lie between the Opposition and the Government with respect to environmental matters was that this Government was prepared to override the States. That was defined by Mr Phillip Toyne and the Australian Conservation Foundation</PARA>
<PARA>as the touchstone issue--the major issue--which distinguished the two parties. Of course, that issue was built on a subterfuge and a fraud. It was built on a lie. It was built on the proposition that, just as in Aboriginal affairs, this Government would be prepared to take all matters of State administration out of the hands of the States to satisfy a particular lobby. That proved not to be true. It was never a practical proposition. It never could be true. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has attempted to meet the chaos and confusion which Senator Richardson caused by his pre- election manoeuvring on the environment by this Special Premiers Conference approach and by developing a cooperative approach to federalism. What the Prime Minister set out in the agreements for the Premiers Conference last year was that he sought an agreement for a cooperative national approach to the environment, a better definition of the roles of the respective governments, a reduction in the number of disputes between the Commonwealth, States and Territories, greater certainty of government and business decision making and better environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA>  That process has been going on for the better part of a year. In July this year the leaders of the States and the leader of the Commonwealth reaffirmed the desirability of the inter-governmental agreement on the environment and working towards those agreed and desirable objectives and agreed on the need for setting consistent environmental standards across Australia and so on. That is not crass politics. That is the first glimmer of light, the first sign we have seen of some preparedness not to deal with these things on a short term political basis but to attempt to put them on a rational long term basis that might serve the interests of Australia. It is typical of Minister Kelly that she should be the person to pour scorn and criticism on a process which I think commands broad political support, including that of every Labor Government around the country.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition does not lightly bring forward a motion that the House does not have confidence in a Minister. But the Opposition is left with no other option because of her lack of response to questions, her secrecy in respect of the tape, the belief that she has misled this House and the Prime Minister and the fact that not only has she administered her Department in a pathetic and inadequate way but also she has failed to live up to the standards that are required of her in this House. She should leave the Ministry. </PARA>

The statement also said that, if a coalition government was in power and had the control of both Houses of Parliament, it would remove areas from the Kakadu National Park to allow mining, including the establishment of uranium enrichment.

We will be able to provide at the decision makers' fingertips the most comprehensive range of environmental data any government has ever had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has failed to do the one thing which would have brought this matter to an end one way or the other; that is, she has failed to produce the tape. All she had to do was produce the tape yesterday and produce the tape today. She has failed on the two occasions we have given her to produce that tape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Worse still, the Minister has produced a defence made up of red herrings. If we examine all that happened on the other side of the House we find the wrong 44 were in the chamber backing the Minister. Where was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)?  Was he destroying the tape or looking for it?  Where was the ex-Treasurer, the former Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)?  He was vigorously writing out a speech, with many keynotes, for Minister Kelly. He then sent it around the back and through the other door so the Minister would have a defence. But it was the wrong defence. It was a sad, pathetic defence, and one for which this Minister will be held accountable for ever more for the way she has misled the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have much pleasure in supporting the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) in this motion of no confidence. A motion of no confidence is one of the most serious motions which can ever be moved on the floor of the House. It is totally justified on the facts of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fact No. 1 is that a key meeting took place, and that has been confirmed by all that happened yesterday and today. Fact No. 2 is that the meeting was taped by departmental officers--no ifs, no buts. Fact No. 3 is that a transcript was prepared from this meeting. That is absolute, as we heard in Question Time today. Fact No. 4 is that an officer from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet saw that transcript in the Minister's office or the Prime Minister's office. Maybe the Minister might like to tell us where, but we know that an officer sighted it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fact No. 5 is an absolute. Minister Kelly was caught short when she took that early phone call on Saturday morning last and gave the wrong answer to the right question. She told the Prime Minister that she did not come up with this attack on him. Her answer is that, of course, these were not her words; it was a different context. But what the Minister has failed to do repeatedly throughout this whole affair is to come clean, to produce the tape, to produce the transcript so that we can all see it. </PARA>
<PARA>  This issue is now the leadership issue writ large. It is the issue of who is going to lead this Government at the next election. We know that there is now a published list of how the members of Caucus voted on the question of who will lead Australia. We know that Minister Kelly was one of Keating's 44. She supported the honourable member for Blaxland. It was clear cut. He acknowledges it. She is part of a destabilising camp for destroying the Prime Minister's confidence and leadership. That is what this game is all about and that is why she is paralysed about producing the tape and transcript and laying all before the public once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why will she not do it?  Why will she not come clean?  It is because she has something massive to hide--that she lied to the Prime Minister; that she misled the Parliament; that she in fact did not say at that meeting what she told the Prime Minister she said. That is the truth of this matter and that is what has led this Government to a situation where the Prime Minister at Question Time fumbled the two questions he was asked today. He is paralysed over this matter. He is terrified to sack this Minister over this issue because it would be the spark that would ensure that he is thrown out of the leadership of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>  This spark is ready to ignite. The Prime Minister does not have the courage to ask for the transcript or to ask to hear the tape. All he has to do is to come into this House and table the tape, table the transcript, and then we will know who is telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are entitled to know.  It is interesting to see in this Minister's Department's annual report a statement on page 243 which I will read to the Parliament. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Freedom of Information Act 1982 extends to the Australian community the right to obtain access to information in the possession of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to emphasise that access is available to departmental information. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the Prime Minister said at the end of Question Time today was clear cut--that it was a departmental tape, and the Minister confirmed that it was a departmental tape. Therefore, it is not private property. It does not belong to the Minister's office. It is the property of the people of Australia. It is the right of the people of Australia to be fully aware of what is in that tape. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister cannot have it both ways. Indeed, there was a fundamental contradiction in Question Time today. On the one hand, the Prime Minister made it clear that he had sent an officer to view that tape and that transcript. On the other hand, the Minister denied that she had had any request from the Prime Minister's office to supply that transcript and that tape. Let the Minister clarify to the House who is right with regard to that contradiction. Let the Minister come into this House and table, once and for all, the tape which the public are entitled to hear, entitled to see and entitled to be made aware of its contents and what exactly was said at that meeting.

It ceased to be a private meeting when a number of the people present went public, when the Minister cast a tape of that meeting, when she printed out a partial transcript of that meeting and, indeed, when the meeting ended up on the front page of the Weekend Australian.   This is no longer a private meeting. This is no longer a meeting which the Minister can duck and weave over. This House of Representatives, the Parliament, the public--the people--are entitled to know what took place at that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister has failed in her commission of office and under her oath of office to come clean on this matter. She has also failed in other portfolio areas. I will reveal to the Parliament what a former member, Peter Cleeland, wrote recently about the Minister's conduct with regard to Coronation Hill. The former member made it very clear that he was totally dissatisfied with the Minister's contribution. He said of the Minister for the Environment, Ros Kelly, that she:</PARA>
<PARA>visited Kakadu the first time just prior to Cabinet's final decision. She spent just one night at the Crocodile Hotel and several hours at Coronation Hill the next day before flying out. </PARA>
<PARA>During the Cabinet debate she spoke with religious fervour on the cultural sanctity of the site. </PARA>
<PARA>What absolutely crass politics! They are not my words; they are the words of a former, sometimes distinguished, member of the Labor Party's Caucus, Mr Cleeland, who is no longer a member of this Parliament. He gives an absolute lie to the Minister's conduct with regard to Coronation Hill, her conduct with regard to the environment portfolio and her conduct with regard to Kellygate and this tape affair. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would have been so easy for the Minister to get this right. But having tripped over with her conversation with the Prime Minister last Saturday, she then tripped over with her first answer in the House yesterday, and she no longer has the courage to come in here and come clean on this key matter. She has failed. That is why we are quite properly calling on her to resign as Minister of the Crown forthwith. Not only has the Minister clearly misled the House, but also, if it was any other way, as the honourable member for Pearce quite correctly points out, she would have tabled the tape. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to see that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has moved down to sit in proximity to the Minister under attack. The members of the Keating brigade are sitting just behind the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. They are part of the numbers campaign.

What does she have to hide? Why is she refusing to produce the one piece of paper which would exonerate her from the legitimate charge we make of her in relation to this matter? Why will she not produce the tape which will settle this matter once and for all? She is not telling the truth. The Prime Minister is so paralysed that he cannot force her to tell the truth. Meanwhile, this divided Government goes down the tubes--and, worse still, so do the economy and the jobs of some one million Australians. That is not good enough. We demand a better approach from the Minister. We demand that she come into this Parliament and table this tape, and take the opportunity that we have given her over two days to answer this question. She has had two days to answer this question, and for two days she has failed to answer this question.</PARA>
<PARA>  I charge the Minister with this failure. I support the honourable member for Pearce's motion of no confidence, and I say again that the people have a right to know what is in that partial transcript. It is not a private meeting. The people have a right of access to that tape. In the Minister's interests and in the interests of this nation, the sooner they have that access, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is a pathetic motion from the pathetic Opposition, which for the last week has lived off newspaper headlines. Whether they were accurate or not did not matter. Yesterday four questions were directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in respect of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), on the basis of uncorroborated testimony given to the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We were told by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that this was evidence of the guilt of the former Treasurer and he was going to die a death of a thousand cuts. Today that evidence was shown to be totally unsubstantiated.   Now we are on to a second attack against a Minister. What is the substance of it?  First of all, at best, it is based on a press release or a press article that says this Minister has suggested there might be something known as crass politics. I have sat in this chamber day after day and have heard Minister after Minister of this Government being accused by the Opposition of crass politics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The mover of the motion, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), has never heard of crass politics in State parliaments or in State governments. He was a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Like all previous Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs he has had to put up with State deals and the wheels that were trying to frustrate Commonwealth policy. He knows it particularly in relation to the Government of the Northern Territory, and also in relation to the Bjelke-Petersen `Boggo Road' Government. The honourable member for Pearce comes into the chamber and suggests that it is a terrible thing to say that some State leaders and some State governments might adopt anything other than a purist view of environmental issues. What nonsense and what hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fairness to the honourable gentleman I must say that for the first time in the history of this Government we have it on record that there is one shadow Minister who, having to choose between an interpretation of a statement made by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the environmentalists, chooses the environmentalists. At last somebody on that side of the House believes that there are some environmentalists who could be believed. What a magnificent achievement that is. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the great achievements of the Hawke Government has been in the field of the environment. As a supporter and former member of that Government, I am proud of it. If one looks at the record, one can give testimony to that. In that respect, I give testimony not only to the former Minister but to this Minister, in what has always been a difficult and complex area. Environmental issues do not take place in a political vacuum. One is dealing all the time with competing interest groups and it is difficult to make the right balance and the right choice. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at this Minister's achievements. Time will not permit me to go through the full list, but she is the Minister who moved to deal with the issues of greenhouse gases. In relation to the tree program, 80 million trees were established in Australia in 1989; a draft Bill is being prepared and will be ready to be presented to this Parliament during September 1991 on endangered species; Shark Bay and the sub-Antarctic islands have been nominated for the World Heritage list. One has to look only at the achievements that have been made in the conservation zone at Kakadu National Park, which has been nominated for World Heritage listing. I would be happy to incorporate the list in Hansard. I believe that if one is going to make a judgment about a Minister----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Those opposite should not get too excited, I will deal with the tape in a minute. All of a sudden they think that there might be something there. Let me deal with the record of this Government on the environment and compare it to the position of the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce. If ever there has been a mealy-mouthed exponent for every mining lobby, every position which has been anti-environmentalist, it has been this shadow Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us look at the most recent example. The Opposition talks about Wesley Vale mill. It is not prepared to face the facts that the CSIRO said, `If you go ahead with that old type development you are going to pour thousands of tons of dioxin into Bass Strait on any one day'. But that does not worry the Opposition. The big thing is the decision that has been made in respect of Kakadu National Park, the conservation zone and Coronation Hill. Let us deal with the issue to see where this shadow Minister stands. We had a Resource Commission assessment make a painful examination of all the evidence that went on for more than 12 months. Does anybody suggest that the Commission did not fully examine all the issues?  What was said?  The Australian Mining Industry Council--that is, the Opposition's paymasters--said, `While we disagreed with the original decision to refer this matter to the RAC, we do not doubt the Commission has attempted to address----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I withdraw. I am happy to advise AMIC that the Opposition is not worth paying anything to. The Australian Conservation Foundation said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This report stands, we believe, as a very good example, perhaps a unique example of an almost comprehensive overview of the issues concerning the conservation zone. </PARA>
<PARA>So both AMIC and the conservationists are saying, `The one thing we do not doubt is the integrity of this report'. Within a matter of days, the then Leader of the Opposition, with all that erudition for which we have come to know him, says that every time there is a mining area to be developed the Aboriginals find a sacred site. I have never heard of a more contemptible statement. A former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in his own Party could have said, `That is a thoroughly objectionable statement and it ought to be withdrawn'. But did he?  No. Did we hear from this honourable gentleman when the then Leader of the Opposition decided that there was one way of dealing with these complex problems of the environment?  If a commission of distinguished Australians were appointed to examine all the evidence and it came up with a finding that one does not like, it is very simple: abolish the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>  Was there one word from the shadow Minister for the environment?  Did he stand up and say to the environmentalists, `Look, this is a concept that I cannot accept'?  Did he go to his Leader and say, `Look, I know we have got our difficulties, I know we have got our problems, but if you don't back off this I am going to do to you what I did to John Howard'?  Not a bit of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet those opposite have the gall to come in here today, and move a want of confidence motion in respect of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, who has a very considerable track record, a track record which will not be equalled by anyone from the other side, and certainly was not even attempted during the period of the Fraser Government. On what basis?  Because someone has said, `There is crass politics in the States'. I spent some time in a State parliament and I remember when the Whitlam Government offered to take over and fund the State debts on railways. Two governments picked it up--the Labor Government of Tasmania and the Labor Government of South Australia. Would a conservative government pick it up? That would be interfering with State rights. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not a politician has emerged in any political structure who does not know the kinds of politics that can operate in any political institution. The hypocrisy expressed by the shadow Minister on this matter appals belief. He is horrified that there can be a division of opinion between the Minister for Resources and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The very nature of those two portfolios also makes them a conflict model. But for this mob that has been in opposition for so long, on the very day that we are getting pleas for no disagreement, Liberal rivals air grievances. The shadow Minister has said some very unkind words about a Liberal senator in respect of internal political matters within the Liberal Party in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Speaker, I wish to raise with you a matter of privilege. On 30 April this year Mr Stephen Paddison, the then Chief Executive of the State Bank of South Australia, appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which is colloquially known as the banking inquiry, to give evidence in relation to the affairs of that bank. In the course of the hearing I asked Mr Paddison the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . is that publicly stated figure of $2.5 billion worth of non-performing loans and approximately $1 billion lost by the bank still applicable?</PARA>
<PARA>In the course of his reply, Mr Paddison said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you were plus or minus 10 per cent, I think that you would feel you had done a pretty reasonable job of estimation, and we are certainly within those parameters. </PARA>
<PARA>I obtained today a confidential memorandum signed by the Bank's General Manager, Mr Guille, which was dated 21 March 1991--over one month before Mr Paddison's appearance before the Committee. That memorandum states in its summary that the recent growth of non-productive items, together with forecasts, was summarised in attachment 1. Attachment 1 contains a table which shows that as at 28 February this year the management of the State Bank of South Australia projected non-performing loans to reach $3.48 billion by December 1992 and its losses to reach $1.3 billion by that same date. This information clearly suggests that Mr Paddison misled a committee of this Parliament on 30 April of this year. Mr Speaker, I ask whether you would consider the matter with a view to my moving a motion to refer it to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Senate (Quorum) Bill is to reduce the quorum of the Senate from one-third to one-quarter. Section 22 of the Constitution lays down that, unless the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the senators shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Senate for the exercise of its powers.  This Bill proposes that the number of senators required to form a quorum should be 19, rather than the 26 which are currently required. There is little doubt that over the years there has been considerable growth in the demands on senators' available time outside their chamber responsibilities. First and foremost has been the dramatic growth in the Senate committee system. Most people accept that this has significantly increased the quality of Senate chamber scrutiny, and through that the effectiveness of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind honourable members that, by and large, Senate committees do not meet when the Senate itself is sitting, and that senators have to reserve substantial time outside sitting hours to fulfil their commitments to the various committees upon which they serve. This places concomitant pressure on the use of their time when the Senate is sitting. I do not think that anyone would seriously suggest that all senators should be in attendance for every minute that the Senate is sitting. We have long accepted that there are many genuine demands on a senator's time which are quite legitimate expressions of the role of being a senator. The pairs system is a tangible illustration of such acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ministers are heavily involved in the administration of their portfolios, and the tasks associated with representing in the Senate their colleagues in the House of Representatives. They have many calls on their time from Cabinet and Cabinet committee work. The Opposition front bench is similarly involved in the work of the shadow Cabinet, and other party office holders face similar responsibilities. All senators must give up time to the demands of party and back bench committees. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to this, senators face an ever increasing volume of correspondence for their attention, and must meet with a wide variety of delegations and visitors. It is now more that ever the case that they have State-wide constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important, therefore, that we ensure that senators can carry out these activities without frequent and unnecessary disruptions, and that they can plan their schedules with as much certainty as possible. Reducing the size of the quorum and, hopefully, the frequency with which quorums are called is one way of so doing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposal in this legislation is not designed to lessen the importance of the chamber. Attendance in the Senate and participation in its deliberations will still remain the most important role that senators perform. But it must be recognised that the quorum requirement does not of itself keep senators in the chamber. The standard of debate, the interest of senators in matters before the Senate, the level of importance or controversy--all these factors determine the attendance of senators. The quorum merely sets a minimum attendance level, on the basis of what is thought to be a reasonable number of the total number of senators to take decisions on behalf of their fellows. Altering the number of senators required to constitute a quorum will not affect the ability of any senator to call for a division of the Senate to decide a question. And the calling of a division, as we are all aware, invariably results in an attendance in the chamber substantially exceeding that required by the quorum provision. </PARA>
<PARA>  Section 22 of the Constitution envisaged that the quorum requirement could be subject to change in the light of senators' experience of the demands of their office. I believe that we have now arrived at the time when it is appropriate to make such a change. </PARA>
<PARA>  The House of Representatives quorum was reduced from one-third to one-fifth in 1989. The Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, in its report on 1 December 1988, found that, for the Senate, a quorum based on one-quarter of the senators, 19, seemed more reasonable than a quorum requiring the presence of only one-fifth. The Senate passed a resolution agreeing in principle to that recommendation of the Committee in 1989, and this Bill is designed to bring that recommendation into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>  The acceptance of this proposal will result in a quorum requirement which compares favourably with those operating in other legislatures both within and outside Australia. It will in no way diminish the power of the Senate, but will, to the contrary, assist in improving the working environment of senators. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) for holding the fort for a moment. The Aussat Repeal Bill is quite significant, as it brings to an end the Aussat satellite service. The Opposition will support this Bill, but in so doing we wish to raise certain matters. The second reading amendment, which is to be circulated in my name and which I will be moving at the conclusion of my speech, will be seconded and spoken to on behalf of the Opposition by the shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bruce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Basically, the matters that I raise in the second reading amendment are these: we condemn the Government for not taking the steps to address the issue of the high debt of Aussat at any time during its term of office. At the end of this period, the Government will have been in office for 10 years and throughout this term no steps have been taken with regard to the debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  The significance of the matter of the debt relates to the central issue with regard to this Bill, because this Bill puts in place a legislative regime that will prepare Aussat for sale. Aussat will be the core of the second carrier, to be nominated after a selection procedure, when it will apply for a licence, a condition of which will be that it buys Aussat. This Bill puts a limit of $800m on the amount that can be drawn from Consolidated Revenue to pay out the existing debts of Aussat and also to extinguish the current tax liabilities that can be carried forward to the benefit of some future purchaser. By extinguishing those tax liabilities there is an estimated saving of some $50m in future tax concessions that would be available to a new owner. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not cavil with the principle that underpins this approach, because, in terms of the price that might be returned to the Commonwealth, quite clearly the people selling this asset would do far better to absorb the debt themselves. It is a bit like selling a house. An owner is better off selling his house having paid off the bank mortgage than trying to find a buyer who will pick up the mortgage, because the terms of that mortgage may not be attractive to a potential buyer. This is so in regard to Aussat. So in that sense, economically speaking, the proposal is sensible in commercial terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is the level of that debt which is the matter of real concern.  The Budget Papers indicate that the debt is $689m at the present time. I understand that by June next year the debt will be in the vicinity of $800m. That debt of $800m, or the $689m which it is now--or something in between the two, depending on the time of sale--will be absorbed by the Commonwealth. It will have to be paid out in advance so that when negotiations start, the Commonwealth is, in effect, selling a satellite service that does not have that debt. As I mentioned, on top of that is $22m in tax liabilities, which also have to be absorbed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  All in all, the debt is a huge amount of money, and this is the matter I raise with regard to the second reading amendment. I condemn the Government for not having taken action with regard to this huge debt. It should be kept in mind that, as I understand it, the size of that debt is even greater than some of the debt that was discussed in relation to some of the recent difficulties in the wool industry. That puts it into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA>  Aussat has had a very chequered career in terms of its financial capacity. There is no question about its technology or the competence of the engineering that has gone into making Aussat provide a service. In some senses, it has been a successful service, but the sad thing is that there has been a continuation of what I describe as policy cramp with regard to the utilisation of satellite services in this country. Because we have not allowed that technology to be used to its full effect, Aussat has never been able to reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting history of Aussat should be related. In the 1970s, it became clear that satellite technology was something in which this country ought to be involved because, in a country as vast as Australia, it affords the opportunity of providing services to consumers and businesses without the necessity of massive outlays for normal conduits on the ground, that is, the normal copper wiring that is steadily being replaced with fibre-optic wiring. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was thought that satellite technology ought to be embraced in this country, and it was private enterprise that initially put forward the proposal of a satellite operation in this country. Indeed Mr Kerry Packer put forward this idea, and it was a good one. It was conceived for all the right reasons. It had great potential to bring benefit to the nation, and we proceeded down that path. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1981, the company was set up under Prime Minister Fraser. The proposal was that there would be no restrictions on where the technology could be used. This is important because the principle I have sought to emphasise with regard to telecommunications legislation is that we ought not to mandate technology. Legislation ought to be technologically neutral. In other words, market operators ought to be able to engage whatever technology is available and let the market judge whether or not it can be realistically utilised at a price that consumers can afford. </PARA>
<PARA>  When governments reach the position of trying to mandate, limit or focus technology, they end up with the very problem that finally arose with regard to Aussat,  which has cost the taxpayers huge amounts. What happened to Aussat was that the `no restrictions' ideal was compromised. It was from that point onwards that things got steadily worse because the cost of the technology could be offset only by the profits that could be obtained from using the service that the technology could provide. Of course, there was a limitation on those services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason that the limitations of service occurred is indeed interesting. I have to say that I do not have a deep knowledge of all the ins and outs involved in this extremely complex matter but, quite clearly, decisions were made to place limits on Aussat in favour of Telecom. It is that basic point that has caused so much of the problem. There could not be a complete flowering of the available technology because we wanted to protect Telecom's large engineering-driven network. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was for that reason that Aussat was constrained and was not able to enter into switched services, which resulted in 90 per cent of the available market being denied to it. Because of that, the opportunity to raise revenue was limited. This was done at the behest of the powerful Telecom unions, including the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. Of course, that action has finally been revealed for what it was. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an interesting sidelight to the history of Aussat. The original proposal was that while this was to be a Government- owned satellite communications provider, at least 49 per cent of it was to be sold off. In May 1983, when the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was Treasurer, he said that he was of the view that 49 per cent of Aussat should be sold. At that point, the left wing and the unions became very agitated, and that decision was never carried forward. The 1983-84 decision was amended, which meant that there was to be no partial sell-off of Aussat. In actual fact, the Government went in the completely opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  At that point, 25 per cent of the equity of Aussat  was sold to Telecom, which then had the right to have its managing director and another director sit on the Aussat board. The scenario was that Aussat's greatest competitor was Telecom, and the legislation provided that Aussat was limited in the services it could provide. In any event, everything Aussat was doing was known by Telecom because Telecom had two members on the Aussat board. This position has persisted right up to the present day. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is important to understand that potted history of Aussat to be able to determine why Australia has ended up with this massive debt. We are coming to the end of the existing technology, which is known as the series A satellite technology, and we are about to engage in the series B satellite technology. It is a very expensive operation. All the transactions have been done by way of leverage leases through the Commonwealth Bank. It is important, if we want to get the best utilisation of services, that we engage this technology--but, I repeat, it is a very expensive exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last year, the Government made a decision to provide $100m to Aussat to keep it operational because, technically, it was almost bankrupt. As I understand it, the directors were not prepared to sign Aussat's accounts unless a decision was made by the Government to ensure that it had a reasonable capital base. In conjunction with that decision, major trade  decisions were being made at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I again refer to the decision to engage the new series B satellites, which had been contracted by American suppliers. Indeed, when I was in the United States I took some time to try to fathom the intricacies of not just the technology but also the commercial arrangements behind this deal. This is not now the occasion to go into technical details or extensive financial details, but I still carry in the back of my mind many questions that have never been answered clearly about why decisions were made in the way they were and why the project was pushed in the way it was when it was known--it had all been stated on the record--that Aussat was limited in what it could do. In spite of that, we persisted and proceeded to engage the next series of satellites. The question mark over the whole deal related to whether or not, given that the technology could provide greater capacity, that additional capacity could actually be used and what was intended to be done with it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was argued that one of the reasons we engaged the new satellite was to take on pay television. The history of pay television in this country has been a very sad one. It is a technology that has been available to the rest of the developed Western world for over 10 years, and yet we are still denied it. The matter has been before Cabinet, it has been rejected and I understand it is to go back again. Pay television was one of the reasons Aussat argued it ought to be able to go ahead and engage the new technology that was provided by the new series B satellites. Of course, that has been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are finally moving to the position where Aussat is to be sold and we welcome that, although the proposed structure--I have argued this at length--is not our preferred structure and, indeed, it was not the preferred structure of the honourable member for Blaxland. He preferred the amalgamation of Aussat with OTC, the overseas telecommunications provider, and to let that be the core of the competing second network to be established. But that was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, I make the point that, at the time of sale of Aussat, pay television was finally being recognised as an important component in what the satellite could be used for. In the interim period, until optic fibre cabling is available, which will provide some 68 channels and inter-active arrangements to households, satellite would be the best way to deliver pay television services. Indeed, any person who would be buying Aussat would want to take that technology and utilise it to its full capacity and would, therefore, want to have the pay television licence. So it would not be surprising to me to see the Government move quickly to permit pay television--indeed, I have long argued that it should do this--and, in so doing, make Aussat somewhat more attractive to any potential purchaser. The value that we might ascribe to Aussat having the capacity to deliver pay television is yet to be determined, but certainly it would be well above $40m-odd. However, it depends again on the extent to which we are going to allow pay television and how many channels might be available. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of the issues with regard to pay television must now be dealt with by the Government: whether the ABC will be involved, whether there will be a separation between carriage and content, and the types of channels that will be available. All these issues need to be brought to the Parliament and we await the Minister to make some decisions. The Opposition supports pay television in principle, but we will obviously wait to see what the Government proposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other matters which is worth discussing is the second matter that I raised in the second reading amendment;  that is, we condemn the Government for choosing structural arrangements in telecommunications which do not satisfy requirements for full micro-economic reform. If we cast our minds back to the special privatisation conference some time ago, we will recall that there was a great argument about what was to happen to the three government owned telecommunications providers in this country: Aussat, which is now being repealed by this Bill so that it can be sold; OTC, the overseas telecommunications arm; and Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  The arguments ranged far and wide within the ALP. But the argument that got the most support at the end of the day was that put forward by the current Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley);  that is, OTC and Telecom ought to be combined to create what has become known as `monstercom' or the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation--a wholly owned government instrumentality which, next to BHP, will be the largest company in Australia. In my view, it has the greatest growth potential of any company in Australia. It is for that reason, among many others, that I argue along with my colleagues that it should not be a government owned instrumentality but, ultimately, a privately owned instrumentality with Australians and, indeed, its employees being able to hold shares. But that again is an argument for another day. </PARA>
<PARA>  My point is that we want to see greater competition, a greater competitive structural framework which communications in this country can develop. A sub-optimal option has been engaged and put in place by the Government. I have had many opportunities to argue this case before, but I think it is significant that we are, once again, debating the Aussat Repeal Bill in this place--this will be the last time this Parliament will be able to discuss the Aussat arrangements--and we ought to make sure that it is in context. We ought to realise the folly of the many decisions that have been made about this technology and that what is emerging out of it is not the best for Australia, which is regretted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition has alternative proposals which I have put in this place before. I stress most importantly that we want to see early competition; we want to see as much competition as we can. The new telecommunications Bill went through extensive consultation, drafting and amendment in this place and in the Senate and I think that at the end of the day it was a better Bill. Underpinning that Bill we want to see greater competition within the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us not forget the significance of March 12. That was the day the industry policy announcement was made. There was a recognition in this country that interventionist types of industry policy must come to an end and that the new industry policy in this country must be to lower input costs to business. One area where we can see dramatic benefits for consumers and businesses is in the lowering of communication input costs to business. It is out of true competition and extensive competition in all areas of telecommunications services that we are going to get the market pressures to force prices down or at least make sure they do not rise significantly above where they ought to be. That is the thrust of industry policy now in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are about to see another test of the Government's bona fides with regard to the March 12 statement. As I have already mentioned, the AOTC will be one of the largest companies if not the largest company in Australia. It is regrettable that it is government owned; in any event, it will be run on commercial lines, as it ought to be--I hope fully commercial lines. We wait to see who will be appointed to the board. The decision that has to be made now is what the industry arrangements are going to be. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to come back to the significance of industry policy. In my view, the significance of the decisions that have to be made by the Government with regard to industry policy has escaped the scrutiny of many in the gallery. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has headed up the ministerial advisory committee on the industry policy. I do not agree with his conclusions, but I respect the extensive consultation process through which he has been and I recognise that many of these issues are difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But the fundamental point that he recognises, that I and many in this place recognise is that this is an industry with incredible growth--and Australia needs to be part of it. The points that have to be determined are: how do we ensure that not just the hardware needed for the development of a communications industry--the switching, the lines and optic fibres--is produced in Australia; how do we meet the problems of the emerging software industry and artificial intelligence, which is probably one of the fastest growing and most rapid wealth generators in this whole telecommunications field; how do we ensure that Australia is going to get some of that action and be part of this industry, given that we are situated in the South Pacific region, which is the fastest growing region in the world?</PARA>
<PARA>  I will probably be corrected on this, but there are about 36 million-odd telephone lines available in the Asian area now; in 50 years time, there will be about 360 million-plus telephone lines available. So the growth is absolutely enormous. We want Australia to benefit on the hardware side and also on the software side, and that is a challenge. The March 12 statement means that we do not set up a steel industry authority or a car industry authority. The question now is: what do we do?  That is the decision for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are varying views, because we have to meet GATT obligations. We have to ensure that we recognise that the next round of GATT is the emerging services arrangements and services industries, and we need to be involved in that. </PARA>
<PARA>  What do we do with regard to protecting intellectual property? That has been ignored. We need to ensure that we are in step, in front and able to take advantage. But if we are not going to have interventionist policies--which we on this side argue we ought not to have--and are moving towards the freer trade arrangements which we, on both sides of politics, have argued for, how then do we ensure, if we accept this is a growth industry with enormous strategic importance to us as a nation and to this region, that we are going to be beneficiaries in this area? That is the trick for policy. That is the dilemma that is facing the Cabinet. It is the issue that, in my view, has been ignored in the broader community. It is extremely important in the medium to long term. </PARA>
<PARA>  The phrase that I use and that I think is important to keep in mind is `moral suasion'. We are not going to have legislative target settings, the existing industry development performance targets or the partnership in development schemes. What we have to do is to work out a scheme of moral suasion. How we do that without legislative intervention again is something that I think is exercising the minds of some of us in this place, but in my view certainly not a sufficient number. I will watch with interest--and, indeed, so will the coalition--to see what the Government does with regard to this very crucial issue of industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next point, as we bury Aussat, is what is going to take its place? It is going to be a contest, and there is a team that is dealing with the election of the second carrier. A recent study which I saw only today indicated that the broader community does not recognise that we are going to have a competitor to Telecom in a very short time. There are two competing consortia; one is Optus and the other is Kolori. I will not go into their detail but they are backed by significant telecommunications players with some involvement from Australian companies, including equipment suppliers and others. It will be a fascinating contest to see who gets the opportunity to be the competitor for Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst I would not presume without all the knowledge to indicate who might win, it certainly is important that there be strong competition between these two to get access to the Australian market. It will be out of the establishment of that second carrier that there will be some competition--although nowhere near the competition that I have argued for because only a duopoly is to be created. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the key points that has to be determined is what are the terms under which the second carrier is going to be able to utilise the existing Telecom network? That is all about the question of interconnection, which those in this area know the significance of. It is the setting of those interconnection prices and the pricing principles that will underpin that--which has to be a determination made by the Minister under section 140 of the Act--which all of us wait for with some interest because out of that will emerge some idea as to whether or not there will be a truly competitive arrangement and the second carrier will be able to compete and provide some real competition for Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the cost of utilising Telecom's existing in-ground network is too high, then we are going to find that there will be no opportunity for a second carrier to provide a service at a competitive rate to consumers and businesses. Therefore, there will not be the competition that the Minister professes he wants to see. So that is another crucial issue that must be determined. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final matter that needs to be determined, and it is one that should be addressed by the Minister as soon as possible, is the whole question of the interim arrangements with regard to the Australian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation--the successor to Telecom; the new, very large telecommunications player in this country. We need to know--as indeed do people who work within AOTC--who is going to be the chief executive and when that decision will be made. It would be better for the Minister to make that decision sooner rather than later so that there can be some focus within the organisation. We need to have some decisions with regard to the final board of AOTC. There is an interim board at the present time, and I assume that the existing members of the interim board will be joining the principal board. But who is going to be on that board?</PARA>
<PARA>  I express the view that we need to have people who are imbued with a sense of knowing what marketing and selling products is all about. The focus for the new Telecom must be to market its products. It must be commercial. It must not be, as it has been in the past, an engineering driven organisation. It is going to be subject to competition. If it responds well and with vigour to competition we, the consumers, will get the benefit. I need to see that the people who are appointed to that board come to the table with that sort of background. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, and it is a matter that the honourable member who follows me, the shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) has mentioned, there is the question of the headquarters and new structure. I do not canvass a view except to make the observation that I thought it was quite remarkable that the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), was reported to have recently asked of the Minister in a Caucus meeting whether it was possible for him to intervene in any way with regard to the siting of the headquarters. As people will know, there is much to-do about whether it should be in Sydney or in Melbourne. Quite clearly the Government is ducking the issue. There have been discussions on the issue. Last week there were discussions between the Minister and the Premier of Victoria, Mrs Kirner. We need to know what is going on. Continuing uncertainty will be bad for Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, we support the Aussat Repeal Bill, with all the caveats I have proposed. I have tried to encapsulate those concerns in the second reading amendment which I have had circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>  That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>  "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House--</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  condemns the Government for not taking steps to address the issue of the high debt of AUSSAT at any time in its term of office;</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  condemns the Government for choosing structural arrangements in telecommunications which do not satisfy the requirements for full micro-economic reform; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  notes that the Bill prepares AUSSAT for sale with the purpose that it forms the basis of the Second Telecommunications Carrier in a duopoly environment, which has the potential to compromise the development of a truly competitive telecommunications sector". </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In my contribution to this debate I want to address a number of issues. The Government will not be accepting the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). I will come to the substance of his propositions later in my contribution. I make the observation that a Party which has competition as a basic underlying aspect of its ideology should not accept the proposition of the New South Wales Premier and his Government which excluded Telecom, through rorting the tendering process, from competing for a tender. It is something which he ought to take up with them and be ashamed of because that is very anti-competitive. It is not something that should be advanced as being part of a free market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would suggest that there is a range of things which we need to address in the context of this debate. I am pleased that the honourable member for Bass has in a sense, by moving his amendment, opened up to me a range of issues. Not only has he addressed the issue of Aussat--and indeed I understand he is supporting the Aussat Repeal Bill--but also he has addressed the direction of Government micro-economic reform in the area of telecommunications. So that enables me to address those issues in some detail. I suggest to the honourable member for Bruce that the propositions which have been proposed by the Opposition have left its bona fides open to question. At the outset I shall take up a couple of issues which were mentioned by the honourable member for Bass. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the things that he said was that the telecommunications reforms of this Government are interventionist in some way. Frankly, I do not think there is anyone in the telecommunications industry who really believes that. Indeed, what is clear and what is supported by the telecommunications users in this country, is that the propositions that have been advanced by the Government in terms of telecommunications reform have allowed us to open up an industry in a very managed and coherent way. Whilst the honourable member for Bass has expressed concerns about the way in which we have dealt with Aussat, he must surely agree that the way in which the Government has dealt with Aussat has meant that it will be received, at least in the market, in the best possible way. That, of course, is the intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the reforms which have been put in place by this Government, as members of this House will recall, the policy broad decisions relating to telecommunications reform were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in a statement in Parliament in November of last year. The statement outlined major structural changes to the ownership and management of the three government owned telecommunications companies--Telecom, OTC and Aussat--and the introduction of across the board competition in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA>  In short, the reforms were arguably the most significant micro-economic changes ever proposed for a major industry in Australia's history. Even the Opposition would accept that proposition. What is most significant about the reforms is that the Prime Minister's statement was made just eight months after a Federal election. At the 1990 Federal election the Opposition claimed that the Hawke Government did not have the stomach to undertake micro-economic reform. The Opposition, as is usual in these matters, was wrong. In the space of just eight months the Government put together a series of decisions that many critics thought were not possible. The fact is that the reforms to telecommunications that the Hawke Government has made in the term of its office have been unprecedented in their scope and rapidity. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the legislative changes debated today deal specifically with Aussat, to understand the context and, indeed, to address the concerns which have been expressed by the Opposition's amendments, we must also understand the position of Telecom before and after the Hawke Government's reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom, now merged with OTC, will be the competitor against a carrier owning Aussat. As against the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has said on a number of occasions during the telecommunications debate, Telecom is a good company but not a great company. What the Minister was referring to when making this comment was that Telecom needed the opportunities and challenges of competition to maximise its potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  Personally, I have great admiration for the staff and management of Telecom. They are committed to their company and I believe they will benefit greatly from the reforms that this Government has instituted. I say this with the certain knowledge that the telecommunications industry worldwide, as has been expressed by the honourable member for Bass, is undergoing momentous change. For Australia to share in this development we need Telecom to be strong and internationally competitive. The AOTC needs to be strong and needs to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom, for its part, has already taken large steps towards this goal. Since 1976 Telecom has raised its productivity by over 150 per cent. With the price capping measures introduced by the Hawke Government, Telecom's tariffs have increased at a rate well below the CPI. Telecom is steadily improving its consumer complaints procedures. I note, with pleasure, that last week the Government tabled its response to the report of the inquiry into Telecom customer complaints from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is my firm and strong belief that the growth of the telecommunications industry, particularly in the Asia-Pacific basin, offers many opportunities for the Australian telecommunications industry--a proposition which, I am sure, is supported by the Opposition. Opportunities will arise from increases in demand for telecommunications of which there will be strong growth due to increases in population and living standards across the Asia-Pacific rim and the application of new technologies--a matter which has also been referred to by the honourable member for Bass. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this latter aspect, Australian companies are particularly well placed. In terms of this, Telecom has a good research record as, indeed, has OTC. I am particularly aware of this as many of the outcomes of Telecom's research have been applied to remote Australia, including the Northern Territory. A notable example is the digital radio concentrator system which has been a dominant technology used by Telecom through its rural and remote area program--a very successful program and a program which certainly could not have been, had the cost been paralleled by anything that Aussat could have put up. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the new technologies which will be applied to telecommunications in future years are broad band ISDN, personal communications networks and voice recognition computer systems. The application of Australian research in these areas by the telecommunications carriers will greatly help Australia earn foreign exchange and boost the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to remark on the criticism made by the honourable member for Bass of the Ministerial Advisory Committee's comments in relation to industry and development. For the edification of the honourable member for Bass I will read to him the principles of industrial development which the MAC put forward. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The principles of industry development should be an integral part of the licence conditions for both carriers. These principles should incorporate  the following objectives for the Australian telecommunications industry:</PARA>
<PARA>*  establish an export target of $2 billion by 1997;</PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed)  What luck!  That is two days in a row that I have had the good fortune of the Opposition calling in my colleagues to listen to me address them. I must say, it is a very important debate which we are about to hear, because it is about telecommunications. I was addressing myself to the recommendations of the Ministerial Advisory Committee in its document entitled Industry Development Beyond the Second Carrier. I was talking about the proposals which have been made by this Committee and I continue as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>*  to promote local research and development, product innovation and design;</PARA>
<PARA>*  to foster collaboration ventures with local services and manufacturing industry in supplying network services and products to local and overseas markets;</PARA>
<PARA>*  to maximise efficient local manufacture of communications equipment;</PARA>
<PARA>*  to develop indigenous Australian companies in the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA>They are important and considered recommendations. I do not think they ought to be dismissed in the way that the honourable member for Bass would have us do. The point which needs to be made is that they are simply recommendations to the Government. The Government will consider these recommendations and, after appropriate discussion has taken place, will come down with its own policy prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, I need to recall some of what is being proposed by the Opposition. I re-emphasise that the benefits of industry development will be most readily captured by ensuring that we retain a world class telecommunications company in Australia. If we look at a parallel case, or one as near as parallel as we can come to, which is the case of New Zealand, we will see that the New Zealand telecommunications authority, which I hope is not seen as the shining light or as an example that the Opposition would follow, has gutted the telecommunications industry in New Zealand. That has had a tremendous impact on consumer services. That is not a model that this Government would accept. I certainly hope that it is not the direction in which the Opposition would see us heading in telecommunications policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, the product of the now merged Telecom and OTC, will lead the way forward for the Australian telecommunications sector. The importance of the continuing strength of Telecom and OTC is one of the most significant policy differences between our Government and the Opposition in respect of telecommunications reform. The Opposition's policy is to have open entry to telecommunications, accompanied by the privatisation of the AOTC. A privatised AOTC would fall into the hands of one of the major telecommunications companies, which would most probably have little inclination to develop international markets from Australia. New Zealand is a good example of that. Further deregulation of the industry, as the Opposition proposes, would also make it increasingly difficult to ensure that all Australian consumers receive the benefits of telecommunications reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate of the Northern Territory, where many consumers are physically isolated and rely heavily on STD calls and low volume trunk routes, such a policy would be disastrous. Telecom is nearing the completion of the RRAP program. With the help of Army engineers, Telecom is presently constructing DRCS transmitters in the Western Australian desert to link Kiwikurra into the public switched telecommunications network. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to make a couple of points about the impact on communities such as those in the Northern Territory if we were to advance the way, as I understand it, the Opposition is proposing to develop policy. I will do it in two parts because it is very important that we recall the remarks made by the Minister for Transport and Communications yesterday in response to a question about increased taxation burdens on Telecom users. I remind the Opposition of the figures that were used. As a result of the imposition of a consumption tax on telecommunications of 10 per cent, the cost to Telecom would be $890m; of 15 per cent, it would be $1.3 billion to Telecom; and of 22 per cent, it would be $2 billion. If we put that added cost in the context of the market which it would hope to develop, what would it do for those people in our community who rely on the protection that the arrangements which are being put in place by this Government ensure?</PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst it is important that we have a strong competitor of the AOTC merged company--we want a strong competitor to come out of this process of the privatisation of Aussat--it is very important that we understand that we have a responsibility in that context to ensure the protection of the consumers in this country and ensure that they get and continue to get a universal service.</PARA>
<PARA>  We have to ask a number of questions of the Opposition in relation to what it would see in terms of eventually pursuing the logical outcomes of its policy prescriptions. What would it mean for the projection of a universal service? What would it mean to the idea of community service obligations? What would it mean to the additional costs on consumers that would undoubtedly flow if we were to impose a consumption tax of 10, 15 or 22 per cent? Consumers in my electorate would have absolutely no confidence, nor would the consumers anywhere in remote Australia, that they would get the standard of service that they have been used to. Nor could they have any confidence that the universal service obligation which is so strongly adhered to by this Government would be carried out in such a way as to ensure that they did have a universal service committed to by the Opposition if it were ever in government. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to understand that if we put in place the sorts of projections which have been proposed by the Opposition, we would see a negative dramatic impact upon the consumers of this country in terms of telecommunications usage. It is something which we need to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst we have not seen the full text of the Opposition's proposal for a consumption tax, the Opposition needs to answer a number of questions in relation to it--not the least of which would be the impact on service industries such as telecommunications. The Opposition ought to be able to tell those people who would be erstwhile competitors of Telecom what the impact on their companies and their markets would be if it were to impose the sorts of draconian consumption tax proposals that it has put up. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer briefly to some other aspects of this legislation. It is important that we note that under the privatised Aussat, the reforms introduced by this Government will have the ability to connect directly with the public switched telecommunications network, the PSTN, and thus offer a competing technology to Telecom's terrestrial systems. The extent to which a second carrier utilises this technology is quite properly a commercial decision for the carrier to make, but it would seem to me that there are significant benefits from utilising the satellite for telecommunications in certain situations. In remote Australia, satellite communications can be more flexible and more cost efficient than some terrestrial systems, and only in certain situations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom's ITERRA system has proved itself to be a valuable tool for isolated communities such as mining camps that need modern telecommunications systems established at short notice. Already, Aboriginal communities in the Tanami region of the Northern Territory are making use of Aussat for two-way video conferences. This sort of proposition is extremely important in terms of the way in which we are going to see technology and telecommunications advanced in this country as a result of the decisions which have been made by this Government--strategic decisions about the micro-economic reform of the telecommunications industry that are supported by and large by the industry. We need to understand--I am sure the Opposition appreciates this, although it will not acknowledge it--that it is far from being an interventionist; it is opening up telecommunications competition in a very coherent, logical and managed way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to begin my remarks on the Aussat Repeal Bill by making a couple of responses to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). The first thing I should say is that it is incredible how in such a short space of time that word `privatised', as my friend the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) says, so easily slips off the tongue of the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I am sorry that the honourable member for the Northern Territory will not stay to hear what I have to say, because it is in response to his remarks that I remind honourable members that it is incredible that just a couple of short years ago he and his colleagues in the Government were talking about privatising as though it were selling the family silver or taking the crown jewels. We have educated them. They have come a long way in a very short space of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for the Northern Territory said that the Aussat Bill has `been received in the best possible way'. That is not strictly accurate; it has been received in a way. But because it is not the best solution for telecommunications around Australia it has not been received in the best possible way. Although we welcome this legislation, which sets the framework for the transfer of Aussat from the public sector to the private sector, it is still not our preferred framework or the way we would have gone in the circumstances. The honourable member for the Northern Territory noted that my friend the honourable member for Bass conceded that this is a Bill that we will support. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for the Northern Territory also referred to Telecom in the context of its technical and marketing capabilities. I share his view that Telecom has very significant technical capabilities. In my electorate in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne I have a Telecom research centre. It is doing very good things. I am told that it has developed some mechanisms--partially to overcome the restrictive work practices that inevitably grow up in public monopolies over the years--that are technologically very advanced. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for the Northern Territory noted, Telecom's marketing does leave something to be desired. That is precisely why we say that the privatisation of Telecom is a necessary prerequisite to improving the marketing in that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also share the honourable member's view --and I want to refer to it a little later in my remarks--that in the whole spectrum of telecommunications our manufacturers and service providers are well placed to make a contribution to the Asia-Pacific area. We will be doing good things in Australia with telecommunications industry development. The rather snide comments that the honourable member for the Northern Territory had to make about New Zealand are really quite inappropriate in the Australian context. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, in dealing with the remarks by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I think that his comment about how we have to say what we are going to do in terms of community service obligations is pretty well summed up in the 7 May press release of my friend the honourable member for Bass when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Community service obligations in telecommunications will be paid for by direct and specific appropriation made in the Budget. The community service obligations will ensure the provision of comprehensive, reasonably priced telecommunications services to rural, regional and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA>That deals with what the honourable member for the Northern Territory had to say about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now make a few comments in the context of the Bill. Firstly, I want to refer to point (a) of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass, which states that the House:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . condemns the Government for not taking steps to address the issue of the high debt of AUSSAT at any time in its term of office. </PARA>
<PARA>In his second reading speech, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) referred to the debt of Aussat and to some slippages that might take place between now and the time that the privatisation of Aussat is complete. He has put an upper figure of $800m on this debt that the Government will have to absorb. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Bilney interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OE4">Mr BEALE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The slippage is what is going to happen, if I could explain it to the Minister, between now and the time the transaction is understood. I am glad the Minister interjected because I want to refer to the most recent Aussat annual report of 1990, and I am sure that when he leaves the chamber he will want to go and satisfy himself about this. Page 31 of that report refers to total non- current liabilities of $556m. At 30 June 1990 the figure for the obligations of total non- current liabilities was $556m. Although it is not quite clear from the accounts, the Government's share of that was probably of the order of $520m--certainly in the range of $520m to $550m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I now refer to Budget Paper No. 2, and specifically to page 54. I should tell the Minister that presumably by 30 June 1991--that is, one year after the figure was $550m--the figure appears to have risen to $689m. In other words, the additional funds that the Government had to pump in between 30 June 1990 and 30 June 1991 appear to be of the order of $130m. In that context we can get some feeling for why the Minister has set an upper limit of $800m, because the amount was $130m from 30 June 1990 to 30 June 1991, and we are talking about an extra $110m from 30 June 1991 onwards. That suggests that the Minister does not think that the privatisation of Aussat will be complete before May or June 1992. That seems a considerable period of time and it is certainly inconsistent with what the Minister has been saying publicly. The Minister has been saying publicly that he hopes this whole process will be completed by early next year. That is the basis for the $800m and I join my friend the honourable member for Bass in condemning the Government for not doing something about that debt earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think I said earlier that, although we have no objection to this Bill, it is not the way that we would have preferred to have gone. We wanted to introduce competition in a much broader way into the telecommunications sector and we wanted to use privatisation as a mechanism to produce more competition. It is competition that brings greater productivity, greater efficiency, lower prices and better services. Competition does that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have to ask the Government whether it really thinks that having a government-owned merged Telecom and OTC on the one hand competing with a private sector company which will be based on Aussat on the other is really going to allow effective competition to be introduced. I suggest to the Government that it will not. As long as the Government continues to own a share or shares or all of a company that competes with the private sector, as long as there is that kind of duopoly, there will be no effective competition with the benefits that that brings. In two or three years, if the Government is in a position to do it, we are going to find ourselves in the same position we are now in with the airlines. We have a government owned airline and a private sector owned airline, and we have a highly regulated industry, with effective competition not taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>  What will happen then? We all know what will happen then. There will be another Labor Party conference, those opposite will all get together, they will do a deal--as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) wanted to do a deal today--of some kind with the telecommunications unions, and, guess what, they will start the process of privatising Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>  It should be quite clear where we stand in all this, and I again refer to the press release by the honourable member for Bass when the Opposition made the decisions on telecommunications. I want to read again from that press release so it is quite clear what we are up to. We want to provide a contestable telecommunications market, we want to open up the process to competition and we want to make sure that the participants compete on an equal basis. The press release said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first priority in telecommunications is to achieve full and effective competition. </PARA>
<PARA>Then it went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Within that framework of full and effective competition in telecommunications, a Liberal and National Party Government will proceed with the privatisation of Telecom, OTC and Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's recent decision to merge Telecom with OTC has removed that alternative from us, because we will arrive in government at a time when we have Telecom and OTC, merged, competing with what will exist as the result of the privatisation of Aussat. The press release also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the timing, pace and conditions of the privatisation of Telecom, OTC and Aussat will be determined having regard to all relevant circumstances and the capital market's ability to provide the funds required. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to take the time of the House quoting from the rest of that statement on Opposition telecommunications policy, but I say again what is very clear from that document: our preference is for an open, contestable telecommunications market, in which we would have Aussat competing and in which we would have a privatised Telecom; and, in due course and in the appropriate set of circumstances, we would have access to that market by other people who wish to compete there. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to say a few words about the discipline of capital markets because this relates to what the honourable member for the Northern Territory was saying. He seemed to imply that a government-owned Telecom-OTC--or AOTC as it is now to be called--could compete with a private sector-owned Aussat. We should understand that access to the capital market brings with it a set of disciplines that is not available to government- owned bodies. The first thing it does is impose on the management the threat of takeover. It is a very powerful threat because it is that threat of takeover which assists in the process of motivating management to perform better. </PARA>

<PARA>  The Government squeezes Telecom and prevents it from getting access to the money it needs for capital investment in order to compete properly. The second discipline of the capital market relates to financing. If access is gained to the capital market, the company that is there gets financing. The Government has so mismanaged the financial affairs of Australia that it is now impossible for it to give any money to government business enterprises. The Government is murdering Qantas and Australian Airlines and if it had its way it would do the same to Telecom. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OE4">Mr BEALE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to say a few things about privatisation and perhaps the honourable member for Burke might listen to this and learn something instead of making fatuous remarks. As I said earlier, the Government does not have the money to give to these government business enterprises. It has starved Australian and Qantas. It is ruining ANL and it will do the same to Telecom if it gets half a chance. That is one reason why these government business enterprises should be privatised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The second reason, as I have said, relates to the efficiency of the organisations. The third reason is in terms of the efficiency and productivity which occurs when a privatised government business enterprise shifts its attention from itself, as a producer and as a captive of the union, to the consumers and brings benefit to the consumers. That is something the honourable member might consider. </PARA>
<PARA>  Government business enterprises should be privatised because that becomes a mechanism whereby the employees can be involved in ownership. They should be privatised because an inevitable result of that process will be leaner and better government. Another reason is that the proceeds of sale can be used, not for wasteful programs like the Government has been involved in, but to lower public sector debt. Another reason is that it is an acknowledgment that we do have public sector failure from time to time. There are a number of other reasons why that privatisation process will improve competition and provide benefits to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for the Northern Territory made reference to the industries that would develop as a result of this Aussat privatisation process. Australia has enormous opportunities in its emerging telecommunications, aerospace and avionics industries. Telecom, OTC and Aussat have outstanding technical knowledge and research potential for the Asia-Pacific region. Telecom's research headquarters in Melbourne is a world class technical research and design centre. A cluster of internationally-oriented private manufacturers surrounds Telecom. Both Melbourne and Sydney have the foundations for world class technical skills in aviation technology. Our technical training institutions should be working closely with these facilities in order to maximise our national advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The mess the Government has made of the commercialisation of Aussat and the location of the new Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation headquarters can lead only to uncertainty in these industries. The Government has still not decided whether to fund a technical and further education aviation industry college in Melbourne's west where there are four airports and the potential for huge international business. The privatisation of Melbourne airport would be an important step towards creating incentive in the aviation industry. Telecom, the emerging Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, Aussat and Melbourne's international airport are all being impeded by ministerial indecision. Decision making in this Government has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I join my friend the honourable member for Bass in saying that the Opposition supports the Aussat Privatisation Bill. I ask the Government to make sure that in this process it does not blow the opportunity to  create a properly competitive telecommunications market. I ask it to make sure that, as it moves towards that competitive market, it gives very serious consideration to adopting our policy on the privatisation of Telecom, as it has with the privatisation of Qantas, Australian Airlines, the Australian National Line and, if we are to believe some reports in the press, Melbourne airport. The Government has an opportunity to go at least some of the way toward implementing our policy and getting the telecommunications situation in Australia correct. I enjoin the Government to do that. </PARA>

I welcome also the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) in this debate because I think a number of the points that he has made--I might say, with a little stimulation from me--have meant that we now have the true agenda on the public record and I want to say a little about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It ought to be remembered by all honourable members in the House that probably the first debate that took place in the newly formed Labor Government in 1983 was about whether there was any hope at all of getting out of the purchase of Aussat, which was the bequest of the Fraser Government. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), now the Attorney-General, who was the first Labor Minister for Communications, took it to the Caucus, discussed it in detail and accepted the advice that the penalties involved in opting out of the contract--which at the time were seen to be about $400m to $500m--were too much. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Absolutely. I agree completely with the honourable member for Bass. In retrospect, the people in the Labor Caucus who at the time argued, `Cop it up front now. Unload the thing before we start; it is cheap at half the price, even if it is minus $500m' were correct because this sorry saga has gone on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Yet, it need not have been this way. Had it been set up properly in the first place with a brief to work cooperatively across the telecommunications field with Telecom and OTC; and had there been a wholly government- owned enterprise working cohesively, instead of it being set up as three individual arms of communications competing with each other--often in the same territory--and producing a duplication and, as far as Aussat was concerned, without the brief for a field in which it could work, it might have had a chance. It did not; it was doomed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now we face the fact that it is time to unload Aussat. We now go to the question of what will happen to the structure of the telecommunications industry. The first thing I now say at any public meeting I am addressing is that the Government does not intend to privatise Telecom. I find that, in general, most people remember only two words from the much publicised ALP conference last year:  they are the words Telecom and privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might take a minute or so to explain to anyone who may be taking note of these proceedings that the Government has taken a decision to maintain Telecom as a fully owned public enterprise and to merge it with OTC, the international telecommunications arm. The merged operation will be called the AOTC, the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, and it will have a brief to compete in the domestic and international telecommunications market. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also decided to sell the domestic satellite and, in the process, broaden its footprint so that, instead of just being a satellite positioned over the Australian continent and the immediate area so that its functions are limited in scope, it will be allowed to be repositioned and it will have a brief that covers a broader spectrum of the Asia-Pacific region. We are enabling a new entrant to the telecommunications market to buy the satellite with that capacity and, through the satellite and an arrangement with Telecom and AOTC, that tenderer will in fact be a fully fledged competitor with Telecom, which at the moment has 100 per cent of the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difference between this and the arrangements that have occurred in other countries--and in particular the Thatcher arrangements in the United Kingdom that the Opposition seems so wedded to--is that we intend not only that the Government owned telecommunications provider will be able to fully compete and not be constrained by the ties that are traditionally used to hold a govern- ment business enterprise back because it has had a monopoly position, but also that Telecom will be entitled to compete, and it will start with a strong advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have no doubt about Telecom's capacity not only to maintain its position in the Australian telecommunications market but also to respond to the challenges of being able to compete in international markets. We do have to remember that other countries are saying to us, `Yes, we are happy to have you providing services and competing to provide services in our region, but the converse of that is that we want to be able to trade in Australia as well'. Part of the whole package is to slowly pull down those tariff and other barriers to entrants into Australian markets, because it is a two-way deal. </PARA>
<PARA>  Part of the two-way deal that is not often spoken about is that it is estimated that there will be 400 million new telephone subscribers in the next 15 years in the Asia-Pacific basin, which is in the vicinity of 40 times the number of telephone subscribers in Australia at the moment, and Telecom/OTC, as a world class provider and as a world leader in technology, is well placed to win a substantial part of those markets. It is one of our hopes that there be a strong increase in export sales coming out of our economy. The path by which the sale of Aussat will be finalised, as provided by this Bill, is part of that broader strategic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to briefly pick up on a couple of comments made by the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), because he is the Opposition spokesman on privatisation. He actually believes in this stuff. Some of the things he said when he became a little enthusiastic about a couple of my interjections came from the heart; he does actually believe in it. He believes that by privatising there is some capacity to provide better competition and lower prices. Unfortunately, he is not aware of the evidence from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The evidence elsewhere is that, where privatisation has occurred to the extent to which the Opposition proposes it, it has not been a universal success. In many cases, it has been the cause by which industry policy has collapsed in those countries and the cause by which in the end the consumers have found themselves paying more for less. That is a little lesson that will become very well known to the Australian public during the next 18 months as we discuss these issues, particularly when we start to talk about a consumption tax on telephone bills. That will be part of the equation whereby the consumer pays more. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was a bit taken by the comments made by the Victorian State President of the Liberal Party, Mr Kroger, last week in Melbourne when he was reported as saying at a Liberal Party function that this time, if the Liberal Party were to get into office, it would have to deliver. He says that the reason the Fraser Government is remembered as such a lacklustre performer is that it failed to deliver. It made all the promises about how it was going to cut back the public sector, how it was going to improve competition and how it was going to do all these things----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, cut tariffs, as the Minister at the table says. There were all these blind articles of faith that they live by and statements about how they were going to deliver these things. Of course, the outcome at the end was a blow-out in public expenditure and a collapse not only in the capacity of government business enterprises but also in the capacity of the whole economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That brings me to an interesting point. It brings me to the issue of the level playing field. As a Government--and I have no doubt that Opposition shadow spokesmen are receiving the same submissions--we are receiving comments from many people in industry and elsewhere saying that the concept of the level playing field is not a real one, is not a fair one, and that Australia cannot expect to compete on an equal basis, for two reasons. One is that other countries do not really do it. They all make the point--and I think validly--that other governments that may preach the GATT principles do in fact find other ways of protecting their domestic industries, and we have to sort our way through that to find out what is a fair equation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other side of the equation that is always brought forward is that we cannot compete also because our productivity levels are down, our worker capacities are down and we do not have the capital base. I will add another ingredient--something we found out in the hardest possible way in this economy: we also have not had the management base to take the opportunity to actually take ideas and funding and to compete in world terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  This brings me to the question of privatisation. Where are the whiz-bangs in the private sector who would take over the management of Telecom, a world leader in developing a domestic telecommunications industry and one at the leading edge of technology and the provision of services, and actually make it better? If it cannot be demonstrated that Telecom or OTC will be substantially better off under privatisation, then one has to ask, `Why do you want to do this?'</PARA>
<PARA>  This comes to the real point. We all know very well what the real point is. It is that the sums do not add up. We are talking about the hole in the consumption tax. We are talking about the fact that when one takes account of all the things that are being promised--the tax cuts, the compensation to people at the low end of income and the compensation to small business that is going to have to pick up all the costs of administering the sales tax--coupled with the promise to cut back government expenditure, one has to say, `Heavens above! What kind of consumption tax do we need to raise all this revenue?'</PARA>
<PARA>  I will take a simple part of the equation. Say there was a 15 per cent consumption tax, for want of a better figure--and I know that honourable members opposite say that it is not 15 per cent and that no-one knows what it is yet. With average weekly earnings in Australia at the moment of $485 a week, to compensate the ordinary wage-earner who is on $485 a week for the 15 per cent loading on the cost of all goods, a $72 a week tax cut would be needed. What worker out in the community honestly believes he will get a $72 a week tax cut out of the Liberals to compensate him for the consumption tax?</PARA>
<PARA>  More importantly, the cost of providing a $72 a week tax cut is $23 billion. I am talking only about a tax cut. I have not even gone to the other things that the Opposition has promised. The potential revenue from a 15 per cent goods and services tax is in the vicinity of $15 billion. So we already have an $8 billion hole--and we have not even started. How are we going to plug the gap? We all know how we are going to plug the gap: we will flog Telecom Australia. We will pick up a quiet $21 billion for flogging Telecom--a one-off asset sale to plug a massive hole in an ongoing taxation policy. Bit by bit this will come out. </PARA>
<PARA>  I keep imagining the reaction of my National Party colleagues here, because I know how sensitive they are about this issue. Phone bills will be going up. We will have a consumption tax on phone bills. I suppose that there will be some equation whereby phone bills will become a business input and farmers will not have to pay the consumption tax on their phone bills. As we go through this equation we will find the public exposure----</PARA>

<PARA>  We have reached the point where the sums do not add up and we have to flush out the real motive behind all of this. The real motive is to flog Telecom in order to plug the hole. We do not need to flog Telecom to provide an increase in competition to ginger up the market. The Government has already provided the competitive environment. It has set Telecom up with OTC as one arm of telecommunications in Australia. It is allowing a fully fledged, privatised operation to go to any Australian and ask, `Would you like to buy your Telecom services from us? If you do, we will offer you whatever services you want'. There is fully fledged competition in the marketplace provided by our structure, so there is no need to provide competition. That is all just garbage; it is part of the verbiage, but it ain't the facts. The fact is that we are plugging the gap. </PARA>
<PARA>  The height of hypocrisy has been reached-- I do not point to any of the honourable members opposite in this Parliament in this regard, although they are bosom buddies with their colleagues in Melbourne. I got a rather humorous letter the other day from Geoff Kennett, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. Geoff wrote to me in my capacity as chairman of the Government's communication committee and vigorously protested about press reports to the effect that it was planned to move Telecom's headquarters to Sydney. He raised the point that Victorians have to stand up for Victoria. That is fine. I happen to agree that there is not a case for moving Telecom's headquarters to Sydney. However, I wrote back to Geoff and said, `Hey, mate, you really ought to be focussing your attention on members of the Federal Opposition because they are not concerned about where Telecom's headquarters are; their position is that they want to sell the show. They do not have any limits on foreign ownership so they do not care whom they sell it to. The headquarters could be in Tokyo or New York for all your colleagues up here care'. I have sent that letter off to Geoffrey and I am awaiting his response. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wind up by saying that I welcome the chance to have a real privatisation debate in this Parliament. There is no need to continue with the proposal to sell Telecom in order to provide genuine competition because that is there already. There is no need to move ahead with the privatisation of Telecom because in some way it frees up Telecom to be a more effective and more efficient provider in the marketplace and enables it to better use its capital because the constraints on Telecom either have been or are being lifted. Therefore, the reasons stated by the honourable member for Bruce are in fact no longer an issue--even if one had ever thought that they were necessary. I do not believe that they are necessary because Telecom has proved its place in the international telecommunications world. Even if one thought those reasons were necessary, they are no longer necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why are we going to have this privatisation debate? We are going to have this debate because the real agenda is to raise money to plug the hole in the sums. That is the issue that will become the centre of debate for the privatisation of Telecom over the next couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA>  As I said earlier, I support the Bill. It has been a sorry saga. It started with an appalling decision by the former Fraser Government to purchase a domestic satellite and set up a structure whereby three arms of government--three communications enterprises--were in direct competition with each other, all in the name of the competition theory. All it has led to are tensions and inefficiencies among the organisations. The end result is that Aussat has operated at a loss over successive years and has now been squeezed out. The time has come to unload it. It has fallen to this Government not only to make the decision to do that but also to devise the formula by which it can happen and to devise the path and the process by which that will be done. In that process I think we have set out a blueprint for a superior telecommunications industry--one which is unique to Australia, but one which provides Australia with the chance to compete in very aggressive terms in the expanding Asia- Pacific market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to speak this evening on the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. I will firstly address my comments to the purpose of the Bill. This Bill sets the charges for the subsidised overseas students scheme which the Government is now phasing out. Whilst new students are now covered by a full fee and scholarship program, a number of students still in the system are covered by the old scheme. It is for these students that the charges are being set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fees in this Bill for higher education and technical and further education are set as a proportion of the cost of a student place to the Federal Government, as has been the case in previous years. The fee for secondary students is an amount indexed by the consumer price index. The coalition has no objection to the fees set in this Bill and, thus, will not be opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The phasing out of the subsidised students scheme heralded a period of upheaval and uncertainty in the overseas student program in the course of which Australia's reputation has been seriously damaged in our own region. Despite the early indications--as early as 1987--that chronic problems existed in the administration of the overseas student program, we are now well aware, after the exposure of the ELICOS scandal, of the astonishing lack of responsibility that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) showed in regard to the performance of his duty to manage this program effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>  `I am sorry'--that was all that the Minister was able to mutter when the facts of the debacle were exposed for all to see. `I am sorry' was all he could say when confronted with memos from his own Department which were warning him of the dangers and collapse of his program as far back as 1987. In the same fashion as his mentor, the former Treasurer and Prime Minister-in-waiting, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), is sorry for the fact that one million people are unemployed in this country but is too preoccupied with getting a job for himself to do anything about it, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is sorry that tens of thousands of overseas students have faced immeasurable and unnecessary hardship, and that Australia's reputation as a provider of education has been irreparably tarnished overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Professor Ken McKinnon, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong and President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, perhaps put it most appropriately when he said last year:</PARA>
<PARA>To put it bluntly, the Australian Government is making a mess of its policies towards overseas students. There is disarray within the Government. The policies are increasingly making Australia look inhumane, incompetent and financially gouging. </PARA>
<PARA>Overseas students are making an important contribution to academic life in Australia. We benefit greatly from their presence in both an intellectual and a social sense. However, for this Government the bottom line no longer appears to be the social and intellectual benefits that one can derive from foreign students, nor is there an appreciation of the extent to which students from foreign countries develop an understanding or appreciation of the working of this nation. The bottom line with the Government in its handling of overseas students has two entries. One is revenue--how much can we make from them and how fast; and the second is the Minister's ego--how big is it and why does he ignore the issues because of it?</PARA>
<PARA>  Let us begin by looking at the first issue. As a result of the way in which the change of policy from the subsidised students program to the full fee program was handled, overseas students in this country increasingly have come to feel that they are regarded as fodder to throw into the front line against the balance of payments deficit, rather than as people engaged in a common educational enterprise with Australian students and as potential future friends of this country. My own experience in working with overseas students has been a significant contributing factor to my desire to ensure that overseas students studying in Australia have available to them the best possible educational facilities, standards and support mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problems that have recently arisen are a new phenomenon in Australia's treatment of overseas students. Australia has a long and proud history of inviting students from overseas into this country to study. After World War II many students came to Australia from our region of the world under the Colombo Plan, of which Australia was a founding member. Under its auspices, several British Commonwealth countries drew up a scheme of technical assistance for a number of developing countries. The Colombo Plan aimed to contribute to the social and economic development of people and institutions in developing countries, especially those in Asia and the Pacific region, by granting them access to Australia's educational and training resources. Its aim was to increase cultural exchange, to improve the quality of Australian educational resources and to serve Australia's interests by improving communication with and an understanding of Australia. It was a program that I think everybody recognises was of immense benefit to all those who participated. </PARA>
<PARA>  Apart from education as a form of foreign aid or development assistance, since 1980 Australia has offered fee paying private overseas students places in Australian universities and colleges. The Opposition has no criticisms of the concept of the full fee paying overseas students program. It is not inevitable that the program be handled in the often insulting and poorly coordinated way that it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  Increasingly it has become recognised that Australian education is a highly desirable commodity, which has been packaged, marketed and sold widely overseas. Presently, there are some 80,000 students in Australia; of these, 25,000 are engaged in secondary and tertiary formal education, whilst a further 40,000 are involved in non-formal courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  Overseas students have come to Australia in recent years under four broad categories. There are sponsored students, who are sponsored by particular countries and in particular disciplines, whose fees and living expenses are met to a significant degree by Australian aid programs; subsidised students, who pay an overseas student charge to Commonwealth revenue, which is the precise subject of this legislation; private full fee paying students; and finally, exchange students and occupational trainees. </PARA>
<PARA>  Until 1989 the sponsored and subsidised students at the undergraduate level were required to compete for places with Australian students within any quota set by institutions. Full fee paying students, provided they met academic entry requirements, were not affected by any quota. From 1990 all overseas students beginning their studies were charged full fees and no new subsidised students were enrolled, other than students under scholarship programs. This development brought a decisive shift in the framework of Australian higher education; a shift that has been far more obvious in regard to overseas students than it has to Australian students. I refer, of course, to the end of free education. This shift has been acknowledged by Professor McKinnon, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who in a speech 12 months ago observed:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has in fact moved decisively from a free publicly supported higher education system to a part user-pays, tuition fees system. The low key, polite competition for students of yesteryear is giving way to a more openly competitive free market approach, with few checks and balances. </PARA>
<PARA>There was initial concern at such developments. The Goldring Committee of Review of Private Overseas Student Policy, which looked at overseas students in 1984, forecast both a drop in the numbers of overseas students if a full fee scheme were introduced and a corresponding decline in academic standards and the quality of education offered to Australian students. Clearly, these concerns have been shown to be groundless. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the first count, in the three years between 1986 and 1989, not only did the number of overseas students not fall but it increased by a factor of 27. On the second count, experience of recent years has shown that, contrary to standards falling, the advent of full fee paying students has led the way in innovation, diversity and a multiplicity of new services. The market has spoken clearly and eloquently. Professor McKinnon said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no denying that paying students are more demanding. I do not myself object, as these demands do focus staff attention on the teaching/ learning function of the university. In any case, now that Australian students are paying the HECS charge, they are increasing their demands for student services, so that, again, international students have served a useful service in pointing the way to needs of the future. </PARA>
<PARA>A sharp contrast is emerging with the situation of the largely deregulated overseas student sector existing as a virtual island in a sea of Government-imposed regulation over higher education for Australian students in Australia. There is overwhelming evidence that market forces which have been allowed to operate have triggered innovation. Institutions, departments, and individuals within departments, have developed a diversity of approaches and teaching arrangements for overseas students. Twinning arrangements, articulated programs, transfer agreements, cross-crediting arrangements, summer semesters and a variety of other arrangements have come into existence in a full flowering of the fruits of diversity. This diversity, though, is conspicuously absent from the courses mounted for Commonwealth funded Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of other canards have been laid to rest in this development of the market in education. It was a favourite criticism that the older, more established institutions would dominate the lucrative fee paying overseas student market. Quite simply, they have not. On the contrary, many of the smaller institutions, the regional institutions and the less well known ones, have grasped with both hands the opportunity to build on their distinctive strengths and they have benefited from it. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are wild contradictions in the current arrangements that prevent institutions from charging fees to Australians who find themselves outside the Government funded quota but enable those institutions to charge full fees for overseas students. There is a grave inequity in those arrangements which needs to be addressed. If it is not addressed by the Government, it will certainly be addressed by the coalition when it comes to government after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Industry Commission draft report on exports of education services noted, the grafting of a market oriented export sector onto a highly regulated largely government funded sector was bound to create tensions. It has also created absurdities, especially in regard to the de facto limit that such an arrangement places on the growth of the export market. I quote the Industry Commission's draft report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, numbers of Australians who qualify for entry are turned away from institutions because allocated government funding is not sufficient to provide them with places. To preserve the academic requirement of uniform entry standards, overseas students with similar ability are not admitted. As a result, the market for overseas students is restricted. </PARA>
<PARA>It can be seen that the Government's regulation of the domestic market for education is also inhibiting the growth of the overseas market. Quite clearly, this anomaly could be dealt with by enabling institutions to set their own charges for their students, determine their entry requirements, and have the option to charge fees for unfunded places. </PARA>
<PARA>  The distinguished former Vice-Chancellor of Sydney University, Sir Bruce Williams, is adamant that market responsiveness works to elevate quality considerations and that there are considerable spin-offs for Australian students. Sir Bruce Williams has written along the following lines:</PARA>
<PARA>The realisation that the demand for full fee places will be influenced by success rates and by what current and former students have to say about their courses has induced a keener interest in the problems of teaching, in the recognition and assessment of prior qualifications, in orientation and bridging courses, in the various ways of helping students to overcome language problems, in inadequate subject knowledge, and in problems which arise from what are said to be differences in cultural attitudes towards styles of teaching and learning. Attention to these problems should have a beneficial effect on the education of home students. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no denying the attractions of encouraging large numbers of private overseas students to our educational institutions. Universities are under growing pressure from governments to find sources of revenue other than money that comes from the public purse. It is easy to see that revenue generated by the sale of education overseas is needed by higher education institutions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission's draft report--the full and final report should not be too far away--pointed the way towards a considerable deregulation of higher education. In doing so, it vindicated the coalition's criticisms of the Government's handling of education exports. The Commission painted the picture with stark clarity--in black and white--stating that the choice must be made `whether to constrain the growth of the export sector or to move more rapidly to give market demand a larger role in determining the provision of places at universities'. It can be put no clearer than that. There can be no doubt in which direction policy must move if Australia is to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity and be given the means to deliver what it already produces. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only was the Industry Commission looking ahead with clarity, but also it looked back, one must say, with scathing criticism of the Government's clumsy and ill-advised attempts to regulate the education export industry. The Government's knee-jerk response to a problem that required a degree of finetuning was to bring in the regulators. It was a bulldozer brought in to shift an ant hill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The distinct impression is that the Government did not identify any problems until it was too late. When it did, it failed to appreciate their nature. As a result, the response was quite inappropriate. In the words of the Industry Commission, `a major early mistake was the decision not to require bona fide testing of applicants for student visas'. Again, when the brakes were put on, the policy stance changed from one that was fairly relaxed to one that some say is now too strict and poorly targeted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's whole approach was chaotic and poorly coordinated. There is criticism in the Industry Commission's report of the lack of proper coordination of policies between the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Judging by comments that one still receives from management in relation to the sale of education services overseas, I believe that the lack of coordination is still a problem which has not been addressed satisfactorily by the Government. Unlike the Government, when this legislation was introduced the coalition consulted the industry. It was only because the coalition understood the nature of the problem that it was able to improve the poorly conceived and draconian legislation when it finally came before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the shock waves from the Government's mismanagement continue to reverberate, as the Budget has just revealed. Last year, on the taxpayers' behalf, the Government refunded $29m out of the $50m that was allocated in last year's Budget to students who had prepaid fees for English language intensive courses for overseas students, or ELICOS, institutions but were subsequently unable to come to Australia to take up their studies because of the Government's changes of policy. Why did the Government change its policy? It had to accommodate the repercussions of the emotional decision made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to give blanket protection to 20,000 Chinese nationals after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such policy making on the run has cut a swathe of havoc through both immigration and education and has left the need for a great deal of repair work to be done to restore faith in Australia's capacity to make rational decisions. In the present Budget, the expenditure of a further $50m is projected by the Government to make refunds to these students. By its actions, the Government has offended countries throughout our region. I am quite sure that the Minister was informed of that during his recent swing through the region. </PARA>
<PARA>  In China and Hong Kong, there were protests by students because of the impact of this Government's policies on those who had to scrape and scratch money together. Much of that money has since been lost to them as a result of the Government's policies. I understand that the Government is virtually under an ultimatum from the People's Republic of China to have the whole matter sorted out by the end of October this year. This Government has exposed both itself and Australia to pressures of this type because of its unwillingness to approach the program in a well thought out and properly coordinated way and to achieve coordination between its export policies and its domestic education policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the phasing out of the subsidised students scheme, a scholarship program--the equity and merit scholarship scheme--was introduced as a replacement for the subsidy. The aim of the scholarships is to promote human resource development in developing countries. Currently, approximately 1,800 students from 20 nations--mostly in the Asia- Pacific region--are in receipt of these scholarships. The scheme has two streams: equity scholarships, which are for students who have academic ability but who do not have the same advantages as others in their country, and the so-called merit scholarships, which are for students who have exceptional academic merit and are drawn from any section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  It must be said that there have been some difficulties with the scheme which have resulted in the program being significantly underspent by approximately 10 per cent of its total allocation. I understand that this has been due to problems in intergovernmental arrangements and often a reluctance by some countries to accept the equity criteria stipulated by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, this is most unfortunate and points to yet another area in the export of education in which the Government's handling has been called into question. I should also remind the chamber that, when the Government moved from the subsidised student program to the full fee program, it gave quite explicit undertakings to Australian universities that this would not affect their revenue from the students. In fact, of course it did, and there has been very considerable and long-lasting unhappiness in higher education institutions over what is regarded as the Government's deception of Australian higher education institutions in the introduction of the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The operation of the equity and merit scholarship scheme clearly requires a very close look to determine the extent to which it is achieving its purposes. The export of education services has been a positive development overall and its full potential is still to be realised. We in Australia can be rightly proud of the quality of education which is available here and which we hope will improve even further over the years with the implementation of the coalition's policies for higher education. We believe that Australia has had, and will continue to have a great deal to offer to the students of other countries and particularly the students in our region. We believe that the education services we can offer to students will continue to be amongst the most valuable contributions that this country can make to international well-being. Strong support for such a role for Australia will be an important element in our policy approach in government. But we believe that, as part of a commitment to reinvigorating education and education standards in Australia, Australia should strive to be a resource centre for learning in our region. </PARA>
<PARA>  The export education industry is highly competitive in the international marketplace. What Australia has to offer--and in the coalition's view, as I have said, we have much to offer--depends to a large extent on the conditions being created in Australia for the industry to compete with and match the international standards established in the marketplace. As in other industries, the case has been made again and again that intervention by government does not bolster competition. Quite the reverse; it distorts the situation and obstructs true competition and the workings of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>  The call for a significant deregulation of higher education is no mere ideological point-scoring exercise. It is, as the Industry Commission indicated and as a growing body of informed opinion in higher education in Australia is indicating, the appropriate road to quality, performance and responsiveness. But the shackles need to come off to enable Australia to do it properly and appropriately. There is nothing to lose but the entrenched underperformance of an over-regulated and enfeebled system which is artificially denied by the Government through its regulation from realising its potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important in talking about the higher education industry to recognise that regarding education in this way has the potential to open up enormous educational and cultural opportunities. We should never forget that there is a non-economic dimension to the relationships that are being established between students coming to this country and Australian students and institutions. We have much to gain in the future, as we have gained in the past, from the warm recollections of positive experiences which overseas students have had in this country. It is unfortunate that a narrow perspective to this program has been taken and, apparently, is still being transmitted to overseas students applying for places in Australian institutions. That creates the impression in their minds that we are interested in their dollars rather than in their education or their futures as people, or as possible ambassadors for Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is something that has to be remedied, and it will be remedied to the extent that our institutions are increasingly encouraged to take independent charge of their own programs and their own affairs and are able to take a constructive view of both those students coming into Australia and Australian students. At the present time, unfortunately, the whole exercise is marred by this extraordinary and gross inequity whereby we have 30,000 qualified Australian students who cannot get entry into our institutions while at the same time the Government is twisting the arms of institutions to relieve its own budgetary problems by taking in increasing numbers of overseas students. There is a contradiction between these policies, and until that contradiction and that inequity is resolved we are not going to achieve the full benefits that are available to us from bringing so many students from other countries to Australia. We do not oppose this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), and I agree that the whole notion of the export of education services is one that has only fairly recently been grasped, but those services now realise significant export dollars for Australia. I will after dinner detail some of the dollars and cents of those export dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I recall a particular series of discussions I had with a number of Singaporean Cabinet Ministers late last year, some of whom were trained in Australia. The fact that significant political entities are trained in Australia means that there is a sort of natural empathy and ability to converse and so on, but it also makes them acute observers of Australian society. It is very difficult to put one over someone who has been trained in your own backyard. I am thinking of one particular Minister who was trained at the University of Queensland. Our conversation was not just polite conversation; we immediately got into the stuff of Australian politics. I was at a disadvantage because I did not understand Singaporean politics to the degree to which he understood Australian politics. That is not, of course, to belittle the importance of these leaders of the future being trained in Australia; it is rather to illustrate the enormous impact it has when such people who end up running other countries, other governments, are trained in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is the advantage of an individual being trained here, returning to his or her own country and then keeping up contact with this country, but there is a more significant point. I was talking to a lawyer earlier in the day who is interested in international trade. He talked about the importance of the language--and he really meant the legal language--in which international contracts are written, and said that this applies now particularly in Europe with a single European Community and market. One of the great topics of debate is to be: where will companies go in order to have a dispute over a contract satisfied?  What courts shall they move to in order to have that dispute heard?  In a sense, Australia needs to offer its own legal system and language and courts to resolve contract disputes between Australian and, for instance, Asian contractors or business people. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not just a matter of the individual student and the knowledge and the energies which they take from Australia; it is also a matter of the systems of knowledge that we can export. If the Australian legal system becomes an important base for satisfying trade disputes between Australia and Asian nations, all of a sudden not just a lot of lawyers will get a lot of work but a great deal of the language of trade and the resolution of trade disputes will take place on our terms, with our language and according to our rules. If, in a sense, Australia can bequeath these systems of resolving disputes in trade, we will intensify enormously our ability to export knowledge, to export our own ways and to really take an enormous step forward in internationalising our own rules of play, if you like. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was an interesting conversation I had with that lawyer, who really reminded me that it is not only the business of Australia educating particular individuals in the roles they will play that we are interested in, but also the rules of play themselves. Of course, we know the Americans have been very good at this. They always export the rules of play. The very language of trade is often American or British or, in some cases, French. Australia needs to realise that, if we become involved at that level, we do begin to get a much more powerful means of becoming players in international trade. I will expand those remarks at some minor length after the dinner break and I will also try to detail some of the dollars and cents that Australia is making out of educational exports. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.   Mr JOHNS--I will continue with my comments concerning the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. During dinner I listened to a talk by Phil Ruthven from Ibis Services about Australia's export industries for the twenty-first century. In that general amalgamation of industries called services industries he listed education as one of the feature industries that should, and undoubtedly will, earn export dollars for Australia from here on. He included tertiary and lower education services, which include incoming students and outgoing teachers. He also included electronic education such as satellite diskettes, CDs and videos. There was another area called information services and intellectual property. </PARA>
<PARA>  Before dinner I was seeking to make the point that we concentrate on each student's abilities and education and I was describing things such as contracts written between companies, the laws under which they are written and how disputes over contracts are arbitrated, whether under Australian law or under Asian law. I understand that in Sydney there is a committee chaired by Sir Laurence Street that is looking at the notion of international arbitration. Here at least we have an illustration that if Australia can set some of the rules by which trading nations trade and resolve their disputes, we can sell those intellectual services about resolving those disputes in trade and that itself becomes a much more powerful educational export than the simple export of the graduate or postgraduate. </PARA>
<PARA>  I shall keep my eye on that international arbitration group because we do have some competitors in our own region. Malaysia and Singapore are attempting to become the rule makers. They would rather have international disputes in trade settled in their countries according to their rules and laws. So there is competition as to which country will guide the rules of trade in the near future. Australia ought to be in that business. </PARA>
<PARA>  To illustrate the size of this trade now in educational services, I have some figures here from the ABS publications Balance of Payments Australia for 1988-89 and 1989-90, which indicate the student expenditure on education services for the years 1985-86 to 1989-90 in millions of dollars. During this period we have moved away from a situation in which many overseas students came in as part of our aid program to a much more fee charging, trade oriented program, and even beyond that to realise our full international responsibilities for trading in education. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that context, in 1985-86, 14 per cent of student expenditure on education services was for sponsored students, 83 per cent was for subsidised students and only 3 per cent was for full fee students. Nevertheless, the total expenditure in that period was $219m--that is, $219m of earnings. In 1989-90 the total expenditure was $536m. So the absolute amounts of money earned through education services grew enormously. As well, the sorts of students coming here changed. Sponsored students represented only 5 per cent of student expenditure on education services, subsidised students represented only 20 per cent, and full fee students represented 74 per cent. So we have an increase in the amount of expenditure on education services and also a shift towards full fee paying students. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were some changes within the nature of those students. Some figures that DEET has accumulated indicate that fees paid by full fee paying overseas students in 1990 were highest at the undergraduate level, where $111.9m, or 30 per cent of the total, was paid by undergraduates. Those in the ELICOS, the English language intensive courses, came up to $117.4m, or 31 per cent of all fees. That gives a total of $373.6m. The ELICOS program as a course has been to some extent a leading edge of our educational exports. Of course, there have been some problems in its management----</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Because there have been some firms which have been an absolute disgrace. The private sector has been a disgrace in the way that some people have touted their services, particularly to Asian nations. They have taken the money up front, not run their businesses properly, and then they have gone broke. They have asked the Government to bail them out. To some extent we must bail them out in order to keep the good name of this nation whole. But we cannot go the whole hog and continue to bail out those people; and we shall not do so. I think the lesson has now been learned not only among educational services but also within corporate Australia that if they play poorly and rip people off, then ultimately they go broke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will flesh out some of the amounts being provided by these educational services. In the ABS Balance of Payments Australia, 1988-89 and 1989-90, there are measures of student expenditure on other goods and services. They are the things that students spend money on other than direct fees and direct education expenses. Again we are comparing 1985-86 with 1989-90 in millions of dollars in 1989- 90 prices. In 1985-86 $155m was spent on other goods and services by students; in 1989- 90 that figure had risen to $293m. So significant amounts of money are spent in paying of fees and on other goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>  Beyond that we have a further specification on how much students are spending while they are here studying. We have some figures by the ELICOS Association in 1990 and by the Careers Business College from early 1991. The ELICOS Association figures indicate that average weekly expenditure by non-formal students was $140 per week. The Careers Business College survey showed that the figure was some $144 per week. So significant sums are being spent here by overseas students.   Further, a survey by the Centre for International Economics indicates that expenditure per student provided similar sorts of ranges of figures. University students were spending $188 per week, secondary school students were spending $179 per week, ELICOS students were spending $204 per week, and a category of special study students were spending $256 per week. By and large, in historical terms, we are still pretty much at the beginning of what is an expanding export service. I know that the Government will do all that it can to encourage the further export of education services because we fit very roundly within Phil Ruthven's export industries for the twenty-first century. Education needs to take its place as part of Australia's prime export industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously, our ability to compete within Asia will be greatly enhanced because intelligent, and often well heeled, Asian students will visit here--as they have for many years--and return to their own countries and immediately pick up the flavour, language, culture and ideas of Australia. It certainly makes them more able to do business with Australia but, as I said before the dinner adjournment, it may also make them more critical of Australia's ways. That is not a bad thing at all. At least it will open up dialogue between the two of us. </PARA>
<PARA>  I conclude by emphasising that this is about not just the individual and the individual contact that we will make between overseas students and Australia, but the setting of ground rules about things like international trade. The committee on international arbitration is an attempt to set the rules by which people will resolve contractual disputes, hopefully using Australian standards and Australian legal mores. In that sense, we export a whole way of thinking about resolving commercial disputes not only, of course, giving jobs to Australian lawyers but also really bringing onshore a group of people who will be interested in us helping them resolve their commercial disputes. Little by little those people would be drawn into trade with us because they see us as competent, dealing properly with them and having a fair basis for sorting out the inevitable disputes that do arise in commercial practices. </PARA>
<PARA>  I support this Bill and commend the Government for its good deeds in lifting Australia's educational services into one of the great educational industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support this rather benign housekeeping Bill--the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1991--relating to fees for higher education. However, my view of this issue is not as uncontroversial as that of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who talked at great length about the advantages to Australia in terms of the export income gained from extra places in tertiary education and the sale of those places to overseas students. I support his statements in that context, but we have some real problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The ELICOS fiasco was not just a running away with the ball game by those who were charged with the responsibility of delivering the programs, but was contributed to in major respects by the Minister and added to by the 20,000 Chinese students added by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA>  When we examine the issue of fee paying students, perhaps there is a broader issue that we should consider today in the Australian context and the problem that overseas fee paying students--in the absence of Australian fee paying students--cause the higher education system in our country and particularly, I might say, in my electorate of La Trobe and elsewhere in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Higher Education Funding Act states that in addition to the current arrangements for subsidised overseas students--which is dealt with by this Bill we are discussing today--institutions will be allowed to offer courses to additional overseas students who are willing to pay the full costs of places in either a mainstream or special course. At the same time, the Government was most concerned to ensure that such arrangements do not displace or any way disadvantage Australian students or subsidised overseas students, and that resources that are currently available to institutions are not diverted away from the education of Australian students. Unfortunately, precisely what the Government intended not to happen has happened. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps we might consider for a moment a few headlines in the newspapers over the past few months. The Age carried the following: `Students to face tertiary squeeze'; `Higher education: at whose cost, for whose benefit?'; and `A teacher's lot is not an easy one. Every day, thousands of parents hand their children over to be taught, disciplined and cared for in their absence. Most teachers have doubts about their work, but not all are discouraged'. Other headlines read: `TAFE system faces revamp, competition with industry'; `Crisis in education as students flood in'; `Uni heads reject enrolment claim'; and `7000 extra students strain institutions'. They go on and on including, `The learning fad'. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a crisis in this country today in tertiary education and that crisis is one of access. I have said in this place many times before in another context, in talking about our system of student financial assistance--Austudy and Abstudy--that it is always possible to have access without equity but it is impossible to have equity without access. Today, we have a crisis of access. In some respects our crisis is caused by this Government's dogma and insistence on the unified national system, which has placed tremendous pressure on our tertiary institutions and has caused all of their efforts to go into administrative detail in terms of amalgamation--of universities with CAEs, and universities with universities--instead of concentrating on the main game. </PARA>
<PARA>  The main game today is the fact that Australians have woken up and decided that they want education.  Australian parents have determined that for their children there is no work tomorrow without education. Australian students have determined that, for them, work tomorrow means high educational qualifications. The nature of work in our country--the nature of work in the world--is changing. The age of technology is well and truly upon us. The requirement for high skills acquisition--the requirement for a high degree of education--is increasing in the world of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  For us in Australia who live today in an economic crisis--in the sense that there are at least one million of us without jobs--where we need skilled and trained people to improve the efficiency and productivity of our business, we need those people to be highly skilled and highly trained, having come through an efficient and world standard, high class educational system. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year's Budget--the one that is still before the House in Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2)--brings down an increase in tertiary education spending of 7.7 per cent. Remember that--7.7 per cent. That is positive, in real terms, expecting an inflation outcome in the order of, let us say, 4 per cent. So there is something in the order of a 3.7 per cent growth in real terms in overall education spending in the tertiary sector. However, the increase in student financial assistance is 18.5 per cent and the increase in general administration is 18.7 per cent. We are spending the money on administration, bureaucrats, systems and procedures--not on teachers, places or facilities. That is causing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I said that we have a crisis on over-enrolments. The crisis is only starting. We have little hope of calling a halt to that crisis unless we act immediately. Year 12 enrolments have doubled across Australia in the last 10 years. This year Victorian industry has taken on 47 per cent fewer apprentices than it did in 1989. There are 25,000 full fee paying foreign student occupied places in universities across Australia, with some 45,000 full fee paying overseas students occupying all tertiary full time and part time places, while many qualified Australian students have no access. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year extra students enrolled in my State of Victoria over and above the quota of 8,682, yet 9,000 eligible students were turned away. A total of 44,000 students were turned away from tertiary institutions, including TAFE. Three thousand extra places were called for in the Budget. Next year's funded increase in student numbers is nil. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to take some time to refer to a report by the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission, dated July 1991, entitled The Balance between Enrolments, Resources and Demand for Higher Education in Victoria. It is an interesting document. If it is read carefully one might think that it was a prescription for Liberal and National Party policy for higher education in this place. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Tomorrow's students should be afforded at least the same opportunities to enter and complete higher education as the generations which preceded them. </PARA>
<PARA>We would all agree with that. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's social justice and economic development priorities require that access to higher education be maintained and that positions be available on the basis of capacity and merit. If these are to occur, then planning policies will need to evolve, institutional managers will need to take longer term view of the shape and resourcing of their particular institutions, and the system needs to emphasise the importance of teachers and students and cease balancing shortfalls in resources and planning by increasing the pressures at the teaching and research interface. </PARA>
<PARA>The Report indicates how dependent many institutions are becoming on the fee income from overseas students in order to remedy deficiencies in Commonwealth funding for local students. All this has produced major pressures on capital resources and teaching infrastructure. We have over-enrolled. The Commonwealth Government, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in this place have blamed those over-enrolments on the institutions--not on the system, the bureaucracy or their departments and not on themselves. In regard to growth, the VIPSEC report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite major growth in places and resources over the period 1988-96, demand seems certain to continue to exceed supply, unmet demand and cut off scores are likely to rise; and funding per student and space per student in 1996 will be well below 1988 levels. </PARA>
<PARA>What a disaster. Our kids do not have room to study; we have more and more students crammed into smaller and smaller spaces and Australian students are unable to obtain places which their foreign contemporaries are able to obtain because they are allowed to pay fees. Interestingly, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The most rapid growth is in the overseas full fee paying category which is forecast to grow from 700 in 1988 to over 10,000 by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine, but that will take the place of Australian students. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Planned growth appears inadequate to enable Victoria to offer access to 50% of school leavers in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Many parents and students in my electorate and all over the State of Victoria will not be very happy. We will wind up with major disappointments. There is a problem in my electorate of La Trobe because we have no tertiary facilities and no tertiary access. Both areas of my electorate, which are split in the middle by a mountain, have wound up as having the lowest participation rates in tertiary education in the State of Victoria. Something needs to be done urgently. We need to divert some of this spending from the bureaucracy and put it into buildings, land, teachers, books and resources. The VIPSEC report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Growth in both space and recurrent resources has lagged growth in enrolments creating major resource problems for many institutions in 1991. By 1996 some of these problems will be reduced, but the resource gap remains substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if planned commencements of new students in Victoria can be achieved in 1992, the growth in school retention and postgraduate enrolments is likely to reduce access to higher education for school leavers in 1992 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgrace. We will not be able to satisfy the demand that we have created. We have created all this expectation. The community has asked for further education availability and yet we will not be able to provide it. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If additional resources cannot be allocated, institutions should not commence students to the point where they are forced to operate outside the minimum limits identified, unless they are convinced that the quality of teaching they are able to offer students can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>That will be difficult because we already have students sitting in the aisles, on the top of desks and on the chairs behind desks. Students wish that they could find somewhere to sit in the aisles but they cannot even get in the doors, even though they meet the cut-off score requirements. The VIPSEC report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless the capital fee paid by overseas students is allocated by institutions to provide teaching space or alternatively, the Commonwealth provides a capital contribution for these students, all students will be disadvantaged in a number of institutions. Correction of this may require facilities to assist institutions to capitalise such fees. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps we should let Australian students who do not meet the cut-off scores which Commonwealth funding will allow pay their own fees so that they can attend the institutions, as foreign students do. I ask honourable members on the other side who are sitting giggling: is that equitable?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OT4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, it is not equitable. It is absolutely wrong to let all the foreign students who can pay fees but not to let Australian students pay fees. Does the Government want to deny them an education? Is that equity? Labor Party equity denies them access. We make sure that they are treated equally with everybody else, except the overseas students. The VIPSEC report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In institutions with inadequate space for local students, fee paying students should be enrolled only if the full facilities cost for such students is met through fees or other extraneous sources. </PARA>
<PARA>The VIPSEC report supports our proposition. Surely the Government ought to be able to listen to a major resource body such as VIPSEC. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for institutions to manage the income derived from fee paying students so that: appropriate recognition is given to student views in the planning process. . .</PARA>
<PARA>At present we need to regulate the supply of higher education places well below the market demand or else we will have to find further resources in order to meet that demand. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to over-enrolment myths. The VIPSEC report explodes two myths about the 1991 resourcing in higher education which received some currency as people sought to identify the causes of under-resourcing. The first myth is the idea that current over-enrolments are the fault of institutions which have merely enrolled too many students. The facts suggest that about 47 per cent of the unfunded enrolments are due to increased retention rates for those already enrolled, while pressure on facilities and teaching infrastructure has been increased by the Commonwealth Government's pursuit of amalgamations without providing the funds to remedy historical under-funding for infrastructure in many of the former colleges. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1991 in Victoria, with a total of 8,682 university enrolments which were unfunded, the Government planned another 2,869, and full fee paying overseas student additional enrolments were 2,254, giving a total of 13,805 enrolments in 1991 over 1990 planned enrolments. We do not look like making it next year. The unmet demand is horrendous, and some of the student comments are interesting, too. A student from Monash said:</PARA>
<PARA>The doors were locked when I went to my lecture last Wednesday. </PARA>

<PARA>A student from La Trobe said about the quality of programs:</PARA>
<PARA>My tutes often have 40 or 50 people in them. It's more like a lecture than a tutorial. </PARA>
<PARA>Another student from La Trobe said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to speak in support of the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, to put in perspective some of the statements made by Opposition members, and to put into an historical context the whole basis of full fee paying students and also those students who are subsidised in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Until 1985 Australia's overseas student program was essentially concerned with international cooperation. Education and training for foreign nationals was clearly seen as a component of Australia's aid program. Through the period during which the Colombo Plan operated, Australia established a reputation throughout the region as a desirable place to study, with high academic standards and a safe, welcoming environment. Thousands of overseas students returned home having built connections and friendships in Australia which have proved invaluable to us as we expand and deepen our involvement in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The impetus for the major shifts in policy direction over the past five years came from the 1985 report of the Jackson Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program. The Committee recognised that international trade in Australian education services had potential as a significant new industry for Australia. It argued that continuing subsidies for overseas students acted as a form of industry protection and it suggested that effective marketing and deregulation would enable Australian institutions to compete successfully on the international market. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) that indeed the expansion occurred after 1986 in terms of full fee paying students, because it was Government policy. Indeed, the whole program changed and the system changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, we well understand the problem of the honourable member for Pearce. He is justifiably `unproud' and embarrassed by the kind of record which the coalition government left us in terms of the number of students who stayed on at school and in terms of the response to demands of Australian students, 90 per cent of whom were locked out of universities altogether by coalition policy. The honourable member for Pearce is embarrassed by what we hear now from the honourable member for La Trobe which will be a return to the days when only those people who could afford full fees were allowed to go to university. He is embarrassed by the kind of racism which the Opposition is now exhibiting by suggesting that part of Australia's overseas program and part of Australia's whole economic export industry should be denied. Honourable members opposite are not pro-business, pro-education or, in fact, pro- aid. We know they are pro very little other than themselves--and that, of course, speaks volumes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But we can also ask why students choose to come to Australia. There is a whole range of reasons. A survey of students has shown that students choose Australia because of personal safety, the cost of living and, lastly--a major point--the recommendation of a friend. Indeed, issues such as course costs and other costs are not the most important factors. Australia intrinsically has something that is of great value to sell. We all know and recognise that Australia is one of the few countries in the Asia-Pacific region which can offer enormous safety and enormous political stability. For many of our students, that is a great advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who are these students and where do they come from?  The bulk of students come from the People's Republic of China. In 1989, 27 per cent came from there. Twelve per cent came from Malaysia. The figures have shifted for Malaysia. In 1986-87 we had greater numbers of Malaysian students, but as we have marketed out our programs and outreached our programs we have found that many students study and work at home, in institutions that are recognised by Australian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nine per cent of students come from the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, and if the honourable member for Pearce were interested he would know that one per cent of our students come from Germany and 2 per cent from the United States of America. We are offering courses to students from across the world who recognise the value of Australian courses and prize the kind of situation which exists within Australia and within the Australian tertiary sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not only does Australia have numbers of full fee paying students, but also it continues to have students who are sponsored by AIDAB. We now have 12,000 students who are sponsored and subsidised through our aid bureau. That is an important aspect of that kind of work and it has to be seen in the context of the whole overseas student debate. We recognise that we continue to need to subsidise such students and to offer aid, but we also recognise that this is of enormous economic benefit to Australia and to Australians generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  As was elucidated by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), the whole export industry is of enormous economic value to us. Students surveyed have suggested that they spend somewhere between $144 and $184 per week in Australia. They have places to live and they consume food--they are part of our consumer society. Hence, they provide an input into our whole economy. Aside from that, their contribution in terms of full fees is an enormous benefit to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  What kind of things do these students study?  Let us look first at the kinds of courses which are offered to them and the kinds of programs which they participate in. Sixty-three per cent of overseas students choose to study business and administration, economics, and computer and information sciences. There is nothing strange in that, as Australia is one of the world leaders in the computer and information technology area. The students who come here also provide us with a base to which to export information technology and hence expand our markets in the Asia-Pacific region. This is not simply a statement in the Higher Education Funding Act;  this is actually happening and these markets are being generated. </PARA>
<PARA>  Twelve per cent of our overseas students are studying in the education, social science and language area; and 8 per cent are studying in the architecture, building, engineering and surveying area. I know that quite a number of students are involved in the mining and mining sciences area. In Queensland we have numbers of students attached to the University of Queensland who are studying mining technology, mining sciences and mining engineering. They take this information back to their countries and then purchase Australian equipment made specifically for them because they understand the kind of work and programs which are there for them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other areas in which we provide fields of study are:  health, nursing, medicine, dentistry and the therapies. Seven per cent of students study in those areas. In fact, that makes a very real contribution to those countries which have a huge demand for social services. Students find themselves in a situation where they can develop their own learning and technology and expand a whole range of markets for us. We can export the kind of science and technology that we have here, particularly within the biochemical and bio- medicine areas. We have developed simple tests, such as blood tests, which one of our international companies, which is housed in Brisbane, exports to the Philippines and to the Asia-Pacific. Students who learn in Australia and who are part of our Australian institutions have an understanding of the kind of programs, sciences and scientific thinking that occurs within Australian institutions and so they are able to take that back to their countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as that, a whole range of other benefits accrue to Australia through having students study here. Very many of these students find themselves in a situation whereby they are recommending our courses to other students. So, in fact, word of mouth is the third highest reason why students choose to come to Australia as full fee paying students to fill places over and above those funded by the Australian Government for Australian students. That is, in effect, what is happening. We know and understand that this Government has created a further 15 universities--that is 190,000 places. We know that school retention rates under this Government have increased and we know that university places have increased. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those of us who have been ruled by a coalition government for the past 30 years know that nobody in Queensland over 44 years of age, other than 10 per cent of the population, even had an opportunity to go to year 12. </PARA>

In terms of education they have little to say and little to offer and the community generally recognises that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The other matter which this Bill raises concerns the safeguards for Australian students and subsidised overseas students. The Act states that no course place offering shall directly or indirectly prevent or displace an Australian or subsidised overseas student who would otherwise be eligible to study courses at such institutions. The kinds of issues which honourable members opposite are raising are quite clearly covered in legislation--that is, the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. But of course we would not expect those opposite to know about that because it deals with higher education and it requires an ability to read and write in English. We know that there are several problems in that regard on that side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  It states quite clearly, in black and white, that universities are not able to sell places to students, either Australian students or our subsidised students--that is, those students who are part of Australia's aid program. Universities are unable to sell places to full fee paying students if there is a shortage of places in particular areas. It is here in black and white. We see that institutions may enrol full fee paying overseas students in existing courses where places cannot be filled by qualified Australian applicants. It is stated there and we understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, institutions may also conduct extra courses or increase enrolments in existing courses for full fee paying overseas students. We have seen this happen in an attempt by institutions to utilise fully their buildings, facilities and so on. Most of us would recognise that some of the most under- utilised buildings in our community are our tertiary institutions which operate for 30 to 40 weeks a year, unless they are now running full fee paying summer courses offering extra semesters so that students can complete their courses more quickly. So it is important that if institutions choose to use the moneys which full fee paying students contribute in order to expand the kind of operations which they provide, they should use those moneys to the benefit of not only overseas students, but also Australian students. Therefore, we can all benefit from an expanded, and expanding, tertiary education sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-However, I take this opportunity to draw honourable members' attention to a problem which arose through the demands and greed of some of our ELICOS institutions which failed to screen students properly and which chose not to use resources in the very best of ways. Indeed, one would have expected something considerably better from that higher education sector. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has now put in place very strict guidelines for the English language institutions and they will be very strictly controlled and tightly regulated--and so they should be. Although I am led to believe that all tertiary institutions know what is best for all of us, some of them could not and were not able to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Indeed, we find the kind of code of conduct that has been instituted for marketing education overseas--the kind of code of practice, the self-regulatory approach--has had to be moved considerably towards a co-regulatory approach to ensure that the standards of marketing, the standards that operate in our institutions and the kinds of courses which are available to full fee paying students are first rate and will deliver what the students want, which will continue to provide Australia with a very large export market. What is more important, the system must continue to provide a continuing export market as those students from overseas return to their homes and continue to pursue the kinds of Australian programs which they know and understand, be it in the scientific field, the mining field, the engineering field--for which they buy quite a large amount of equipment--or information technology areas which they are continuing to expand into. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill amends the Overseas Students Charge Act. We have looked at the expansion of fees for subsidised students, but we are moving away from that. We are changing our aid and vision and developing an export market but not, of course, at the expense of our own Australian students for whom this Government--and I repeat it so that people may just remember it--has created 15 new universities this decade. It is an opportunity not only for Australian students but also for overseas students to benefit from our education programs--not just the elite, as those in the Opposition would in fact have it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to have the opportunity of doing so, Mr Deputy Speaker, and indeed to participate in this debate. Tonight I have heard honourable members speak on a broad range of issues relating to education. I gather that I am not to be given that opportunity. I will perhaps take a moment to say that in her contribution the honourable member for Forde spoke in glowing terms about the Government's record in education. I assume that there is some agreement with her sentiments on that side of the House. However, I would have thought that when it comes to education policy the Government would have chalked up--and honourable members must excuse the pun--a monumental failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Forde and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) point to the Government's success in increasing retention rates in high schools, and we have been prepared to concede that in fact that has happened. But why would kids want to leave school at the moment? There are no jobs for them. If that is the only success that the Government can claim, I do not think it is one to be tremendously proud of. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is an administrative Bill to raise the charge levied on overseas students who were enrolled under the former subsidised program to which the Overseas Student Charge Act relates. No new students have been enrolled in this program since 31 December 1989, but obviously there are still students in the system who are progressing with their courses. The legislation we are dealing with tonight deals with their specific needs. Nevertheless, it is fitting that this important subject of overseas students should come up at this particular time, because we now have to hand the Industry Commission draft report on the export of education services. This report came down on 4 June 1991, and I am not aware of whether there has been a great deal of opportunity for it to be discussed in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wish to allude to a couple of aspects of this report in the context of the debate on the export of education services. There is no doubt that this is a very important topic. Education is, in my view, a policy area the importance of which is almost second to none. I do not accept the criticism of the Opposition that we have heard. I think we have a lot to be proud of in terms of our policy in the past in respect of education, and I want to assure the honourable member opposite that, when we announce our education policy for the upcoming election, that will also give new directions for Australia in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting thing is that education has become a commodity that is now being sold extensively. In fact, over 70,000 students a year are now interested in coming to study here in Australia. In the last five years in particular the industry has burgeoned. Ironically that has happened at a time when other industries have contracted or even disappeared because of the economic policies of this Government. Sales of education courses are estimated to have a net worth of between $800m and $1.2 billion per annum. That is an enormous amount of money, and money that is desperately needed in this country. As I think the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) pointed out earlier on this evening in his contribution from the other side, that amount includes the contribution that overseas students make to the economy while they are here. Not only do they pay fees, but also they have to buy accommodation, food and other resources while they are in the country. So it is a very important and valuable industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, it is a great pity, contrary to what we have been told by the honourable member for Forde and others, that it got off to such a bad start. It had a lot of potential. Contrary to what we have been told, of course, it got off to a very shaky start indeed. With the Government's enthusiasm to rush in and offer places the thing got out of control, went off the rails and left us with quite a legacy to overcome. Fortunately--the honourable member acknowledged this rather belatedly--some of the problems that were created by the Government's exuberance and the Minister's rushing into this area have been addressed and, to some extent, corrected. Hopefully now the thing is back on the rails again. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the four years to 1990, the number of schools offering fully paid courses to overseas students actually increased from 200 to nearly 1,000. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. They were encouraged to do that. The fact that some of them perhaps performed less than correctly was a product of the invitation that was handed to them by the Government in that it gave little indication of the direction that was expected. So far so good. But it suddenly became apparent that there was a huge number of students who were overstaying their visas. By June 1989, for instance, there were 13,500 Chinese students in Australia. In the wake of Tiananmen Square another 20,000 students came. By June 1990 there were 44,400 Chinese students in Australia. There is nothing necessarily wrong with that. In fact, they might well represent a very important market for us in terms of attracting students to Australia. Incidentally, most of those 44,400 were ELICOS students--English language intensive course students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting thing is that when we introduced regulation, the rejection rate of Chinese students actually went up to 94 per cent. I think that clearly demonstrated that that great number of Chinese students in particular came in perhaps not with the proper intention. They did not come here as bona fide students; they came here as backdoor immigrants. I believe that has been quite clearly demonstrated. The system failed because the Government failed to implement and oversee it correctly in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and others have also alluded to the fact that around this time, the last five years in particular--coincidentally, five years in which the Labor Government has been in power--there has also arisen almost endemic overcrowding on university campuses. I think that is undeniable. The honourable member for La Trobe was quoting from letters that he had received from students at Melbourne universities complaining not so much about not having chairs to sit on as</PARA>
<PARA>about not even having desks to sit on, as I think I heard him say. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am fortunate to have two universities on the Gold Coast, one of which is the Gold Coast University College of Griffith University. I have said in this House many times that overcrowding there has become almost a joke. We have had at that college for some time now over 2,000 students crowded into facilities that were built for about 750 students. I have reminded the House, and I do it again because it is a glaring example right on my doorstep of the Government's inadequacy, that we have students at the Gold Coast College attending classes at the church across the road, the showground down the road, in portable buildings and in the lunch rooms, and they are sitting on each other's laps. I do not think that is anything to be particularly proud of. To me it shows a demonstrable failure of the Government to deliver in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-He is not a sight for sore eyes. The big question then arose as to whether foreign students were displacing local students at a time when again--and the honourable member cannot argue with this--there were tens of thousands of qualified locals missing out on places. I do not think the answer to that question is entirely clear. It is a fairly complex question, but quite clearly when the Industry Commission draft report was brought down the Government was not happy at all mainly because the report condemned it in so many respects for its handling of the export of education services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) was attempting to point out--I do not think he got the opportunity to do so, so I will do so--that the reason the Government was not happy with the report is that it offended its ideology. In other words, it is okay to let foreign students in as long as they pay their way. Make no mistake; we support the idea, as the Industry Commission has very strongly supported it, of opening up our academic facilities to foreign students. However, the ideological problem that the Government has is that it will not allow Australian students access to places as full fee paying students. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the sake of maintaining ideological purity the Government says that it will provide places free or not at all. From my point of view that is totally illogical. In my view it makes the whole policy biased against the best interests of Australians. I defy any member of the Government to point out where there is not a complete and glaring inconsistency in that. It is a bit like Medicare. I do not want to get sidetracked here, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the Government has ideological blinkers about that. In other words, a service will be provided free or not at all. The Government will go to great lengths to send the country broke propping up a free health care system that will not work. That was so until the last Budget, when the Government suddenly got the message, but that has now gone off the tracks as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission report confirms Opposition policy, which, incidentally, is in line with the position taken by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. We in Opposition recognise what the Government, for some reason which I do not understand, fails to recognise. I will quote from the report because it says it better than I can. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . increased financial returns from education exports can advantage domestic students by leading to higher teacher/student ratios and better facilities. Development of education as an export industry also brings less tangible benefits to Australia from the links established with people in geographical regions closest to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not present too much of a problem. But the Industry Commission report is actually very critical of the Government. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Government regulation of this industry, since its beginnings in 1986, has been characterised by sudden shifts in policy direction, the effects of which have been made more serious by the way in which decisions were reached and subsequently communicated to those directly affected, in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>The next point is also very telling and, I imagine, very embarrassing for the honourable member for Forde and others. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A major early mistake was the decision not to require bona fide testing of applicants for student visas. The early enthusiasm for increasing exports was later tempered by the realisation that some abuse of student visas was occurring, sometimes with the help of Australian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>But when the brakes were put on, the policy stance changed abruptly from one which was fairly relaxed--</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is something of an understatement--</PARA>
<PARA>to one which some say is now too strict and poorly targeted. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that that report--and the comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) certainly are reported in a number of newspaper commentaries subsequently--is a great embarrassment to the Government, not only because it offends the Government's ideology in regard to the provision of education on the basis that it has to be free or not at all and it will give education to foreign students if they are prepared to pay but not to Australian students if they are prepared to pay, but also because it condemns the Government for its handling of the whole of the export of education services. That is a great pity. As I say, the direction is absolutely right. If there is one area that we ought to be pursuing with some enthusiasm it is, of course, the export of education. It is something which we have a natural comparative advantage in. The honourable member for Forde alluded to some of those advantages when she was speaking earlier. However, the area of export education has unfortunately been one of the worst examples of mismanagement by the current Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  As others have said, Australia certainly is an attractive destination for overseas students--for a number of reasons, many of which have been mentioned. Like the honourable member for Petrie, who was in the House earlier, during the suspension of the sitting for dinner I attended an address by Phil Ruthven of IBIS on export strategies for the next century. Amongst the service sector--which he holds out as the only hope we as a country have of rescuing ourselves and our economy--education features prominently. The Gold Coast--in which my electorate is situated--in particular, has much to offer in terms of attractions for overseas students. I suppose that is recognised by the location of Bond University. As a matter of interest, tonight we have also heard about the importance of tourism--I am glad to say that the Gold Coast features prominently in that respect--and of health services. These are the areas in which Australia has advantages, and on which we need to concentrate in order to get ourselves out of our current problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bond University has made a great contribution not only to the Gold Coast economy but to the Australian economy. It is in the forefront of providing what has been recognised as a need; that is, the provision and promotion of education to overseas students. I believe that the university needs to be commended and encouraged. The problem that it has--I do not say this lightly--is that the Government, once again, has been ideologically bent on destroying Bond University since day one. From time to time the Minister has made comments that clearly have been designed to undermine Bond University. He has made them with impeccable timing. The Government still has an ideological bent about not providing Austudy for Bond University students who otherwise would qualify. I challenge the Minister to justify that position in any logical way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Currently Bond University has 307 full fee paying overseas students, which is roughly one-quarter of the student population. The students come from 23 different countries--the largest, as one would imagine, is Japan, with 79; although that represents only 6.5 per cent of the total student population. Overseas students are making a great contribution to Bond University; of course, overseas students are making it possible for it to happen. Local Australian students who, one way or another, are able to pay the fees, or who get there with scholarships--they do not get any Austudy assistance, as I said--can also benefit from that. We do not have any concerns about this legislation; nevertheless it gives us the opportunity to raise the very important issue of the export of education services. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- The Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, as the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has pointed out, has the support of both sides of the House. This legislation has the purpose of amending the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix charges payable under the Act for the 1992 academic year. This charge, of course, applies to overseas students who enrolled in their current place at an Australian education institution under the former subsidised program to which this Act relates. The financial effect is that the overseas students charge, which raised $37.7m in 1990-91, is expected to raise $24.8m in 1991-92.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The legislation gives us the opportunity to raise other issues relating to education. I would not like the opportunity to pass without emphasising the fact that under current tertiary education policy in this country some 30,000 young Australians who qualified to enter into university and tertiary institutions last academic year failed to get in because there simply were not enough places available. Therefore, many people in Australia question why foreigners can come and take places but Australian students cannot. This demonstrates the fundamental dichotomy in the approach adopted by the Government to this whole vexed question--firstly, the adequate training of Australians and, secondly, the opportunities which we wish to offer other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, to send their students to Australia for further training, especially if those students are able to make some financial contribution to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current level of support, effectively, is 50 per cent. That means that Australian taxpayers are subsidising, by one means or another, about 50 per cent of the cost of a place in an Australian institution provided through this program for foreign students--from wherever they may come. Some people would say that was perhaps too generous. I take the view that there are far greater advantages to Australia in encouraging students from other countries to come here, and that is a cost that I for one am prepared to bear. </PARA>
<PARA>  But it does emphasise the fundamental question that while we allow foreigners to come to Australia and to be fee paying--even if it is only 50 per cent, in effect--the sad reality is that under current Government policy Australian universities are not allowed to open additional places to fee paying Australian students. Of those 30,000 which I mentioned, no doubt some would be prepared to attend, at least as part time students, on the basis of them paying fees for the opportunity to enter university. </PARA>
<PARA>  Only the other night there was a program on television in which university professors were lauding the fact that because of their ability to charge fees to foreign students, they had been able to significantly upgrade the capitalisation of their faculties. That is a good thing, but surely the logic should be taken to the next step, which is to allow Australian students to pay fees if that is the only means by which we can effectively allow more students to enter Australian institutions. I think it is an absolute disgrace that 30,000 Australian students were unable to get entry into institutions last year despite the fact that they had achieved the appropriate level of entry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to take this opportunity to talk about two subjects in addition to that. Last Friday the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) launched a document called Australians Speak. It was a report on the concerns, hopes and aspirations of the Australian people. It was the first publication of a program, of which I am the National Director, called Australia 2000. The whole purpose of this program is to encourage Australians to look forward--not just to think about the present and certainly not to look back--to see what we could make of this nation over the next 8 1/2 years in the context of the year 2000 and the new millennium which goes beyond. </PARA>

<PARA>  It is worth noting that some 30 per cent of those who made written submissions to the program referred to the need for reform of Australia's education system. The three major themes which emerged were, firstly, that education should get back to basics, to ensure that children receive education in foundation subjects on which future educational development can be built; secondly, that State education systems should be harmonised by improving overall standards so that children in an increasingly mobile society will not be disadvantaged by moving from State to State; and, thirdly, that education at all levels should be encouraging the commitment to excellence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Speaker, I am quite happy to do that. The report also refers to the views of contributors on the question of difficulties which many foreign students have faced in relation to education. Undoubtedly, that is relevant to this legislation.  In that context, they were particularly concerned about the closure of many language schools in Australia over the last two to three years. The closures have had an enormous impact on the cost structure of the Australian education system in that the Australian taxpayer, as I recall, had to pay out approximately $50m in compensation to many foreign students who were effectively locked out by one means or another from institutions in which they would otherwise have been registered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In this context, therefore, I wish to refer to a recent meeting I had in Beijing as a member of the Australian human rights delegation. We met with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chief of the Division of the Consular Department. Not unreasonably, the Chinese took the view that our investigating human rights has a quid pro quo; that is, if Australia examines Chinese human rights, Australia's activity in relation to Chinese students has its limitations. They therefore questioned whether Australia had protected adequately the human rights of Chinese students. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth noting that at the present time, according to the Chinese authorities, there are some 42,000 students in Australia comprising 2,000 State sponsored students and 40,000 self-funded language students. New Government regulations are designed to control not only the entry into Australia of students but also the age at which they may enter. Basically, this has occurred because of the bankruptcy of many language schools, and in turn has caused major difficulties for Chinese students. It has affected, as I said earlier, the human rights of these students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulties that we face are not in any sense insurmountable, but the fact of the matter is that a misguided policy decision was made by this Government--and I have to say, sadly, that it was made essentially for financial reasons. The selling of places in language schools was seen to be an easy way of increasing Australia's intake of foreign exchange, but the Government did not seriously work out the mechanics of a very complex area of policy. The result is that many of these students have had to pay between $US4,000 and $US5,000 for language courses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of the 25,000 students applying for visas at the date of the change of policy, 14,000 were later approved and 11,000 were rejected. According to the Chinese authorities, among those 11,000 were 3,000 students over the age of 35 years who, under the new regulations, would be precluded from receiving visas. They also said that some of the 11,000 students who had paid considerable amounts for language training in Australia were naturally upset when their applications for visas were rejected. There were some incidents outside the Australian Embassy in Beijing and the Australian Consulate General in Shanghai. </PARA>
<PARA>  Subsequently, approximately 5,000 students still have not received any money at all, despite the commitment made by the Australian Government that they would be repaid. At best, they have been receiving 50 per cent of the amount they paid. When one considers the implications of that in terms of the average income of a Chinese person working in China, it will be readily appreciated that to these people the sum of $US4,000 or $US5,000 is almost a ransom in the full sense of the term. Therefore, when they find that they cannot come to Australia for language training, they are naturally upset. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I pointed out to the Chinese authorities, regrettably it is the case that many prospective students really have no intention of coming to Australia for language training. They apply for language training simply as a backdoor way of getting hold of a student visa to enter Australia and, hopefully, remaining in this country illegally for an indefinite period. In that context, the Chinese authorities took the view that, when language schools close down, the Australian Government has a responsibility to find alternative language training opportunities for these students or, alternatively, refund the costs.</PARA>
<PARA>  It was very interesting to note at that stage that the conversation became somewhat tough. It became very clear to us that the word `threat' may not be an unreasonable term to use in this particular context, the Chinese authorities were saying simply that, if the commitments of the Australian Government were not met in full by the end of October, they would not be responsible for events that may take place in Beijing or Shanghai involving the Australian Consulate and the Australian Embassy as a result of the significant number of upset students. Of course, the Chinese authorities pointed out that they had done all that they could to pacify the students so they would not riot outside those Australian facilities, but they could not be sure that that situation would continue indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>  I make this point simply to emphasise the significance in a foreign policy sense of an educational policy such as the one being pursued by the current Government in relation to overseas students, particularly Chinese students. It is simply not good enough to establish a program that has brought into this country an enormous number of people allegedly to teach them English. As I said, there is evidence to suggest that that has not always been the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The position was made even worse when, after the Tiananmen Square disaster, the Government allowed emotionalism to take control of what was meant to be a pragmatic program--albeit of doubtful outcome. The result was that a further 20,000 PRC nationals have been allowed to remain in Australia. This has effectively negatived the current immigration policy, which has set down a reasonable set of criteria against which people should be judged on whether or not they qualify for entry into Australia. These people have effectively been given quasi-refugee status when there is considerable doubt in the eyes of many people about whether in fact they are refugees. Naturally, the Chinese authorities came to the conclusion that many of these people do not intend to return to China and are not unhappy about spending their time making trouble from a distance. </PARA>
<PARA>  While that is not the issue of this discussion, I think the point has to be made that the Government's handling of this situation has been less than professional and certainly not in Australia's national interests. It has left in the minds of many Chinese a significant doubt about the logic of Australia's education policy. This impression is not likely to be confined to the Chinese; the situation may also affect Australia's relations with other South East Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Australia regards the export of educational services as a serious adjunct to its overall trade policies--and I join with members of the Opposition who have emphasised during this debate that this is a very sensible policy objective--conditions must be laid down in fixed and clearly understood terminology. When people come to Australia as students, that is what they are expected to be. They are not expected to come into this country and take that opportunity to simply disappear into the ether and become illegal immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA>  The sad fact is that Australia currently has well in excess of 100,000 illegal immigrants. Nobody can do more than hazard a guess at how many there are; there may be 130,000 or 140,000. The truth is that we simply do not know. However, we do know that a significant number of these people are the result of a program introduced by the current Government--by former Minister for Education Dawkins--on a very illogical basis. This policy was certainly not adequately thought out in terms of overcoming a trade and balance of payments problem while at the same time providing educational services, such as the provision of language training to assist South East Asian students, particularly Chinese students who have been the major beneficiaries of this program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the time has probably come to look further towards encouraging the export of English language facilities to countries such as China so that those establishments can be appropriately staffed by English-speaking people, including Australian nationals, and so that Chinese people can be trained in their own country. In many respects, the train has probably already left the station because, when I was in Shanghai, language schools were already a particularly lucrative enterprise. The Chinese authorities say that the language training area is well covered, which again begs the question: why did Australia open the backdoor of immigration to this country when we should have known the extent to which English training was already available to students, including mature age students, in China?</PARA>
<PARA>  I venture to suggest that fundamental questions of that type were not even addressed by the Government. It simply embarked upon a program of allowing entry into Australia and then did not police students who came to Australia to ascertain whether or not they were undertaking adequate training. The Government did not endeavour to control the range of companies that allegedly established educational facilities and that then, for some unaccountable reason, went bankrupt. There were more than 30 of these companies. Perhaps it is understandable that one, two, three, five or even 10 companies can be declared bankrupt but, when 30 companies are bankrupted in the same relatively confined industry, I do not think it is unreasonable for members of this House to ask the Government the simple question: why?</PARA>
<PARA>  What methodology was applied to see how efficiently they were handling themselves?  What examination was made to see what type of curriculum they were applying?  Why was it that over 30 companies went bankrupt?  Why was it that so many students were caught, either in Australia or back in China, having paid their money and having lost it?  Why is it that, at the end of the day, it is the Australian taxpayers who have to finance and refund a significant proportion of at least $50m of our money towards students who perhaps should not have been given visas to come to Australia in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA>  Surely a sensible policy would have been: one does not pay money to go to the college until one has obtained a visa. Instead, it appears that prospective students paid their money to the colleges before obtaining their visas and, having paid the money, they then lost it because the companies went broke. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe this is an issue that has not been adequately considered in this Parliament or in the media of Australia. It is a serious question. As I said, it goes to the very heart of the viability and integrity of our immigration policy and it certainly has done nothing to improve Australia's reputation abroad and particularly in China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Last night before the House adjourned, I was speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and was about to come to perhaps one of the most important areas in the Budget from my point of view particularly and certainly from the point of view of a lot of the workers in Australia as to their future retirement. Of course, I refer specifically to superannuation. Last night, I spoke of the Government's commitment to a long range view in its decision making and its desire to ensure that people had access to means to enjoy a secure and comfortable lifestyle in their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I believe that there could be no more clear example of this commitment than the retirement incomes policy which was announced in the 1989-90 Budget. Through this policy the Government has recognised the implications of an increasingly ageing population and the resulting problems to be addressed to ensure that we as a nation are able to meet the income needs of older Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  The cornerstone of this policy has been changes to improve access to and the quality of superannuation available to average workers. Superannuation is the most direct means of saving for retirement. Yet for many years it had been seen as a benefit for, and often only available to, the more well off in our society. This has been changing over recent years with the introduction of award based superannuation and a broader understanding of the benefits available through superannuation. Employees are now realising that they do not have to rely solely on the age pension for income support in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>  Today, superannuation is available to many more people, including women returning to the work force, who can now preserve their benefits during temporary absences taken for the benefit of their families and for other reasons, and part time employees. By far the biggest contribution to increased savings for superannuation, however, has come from the award based employer contribution towards superannuation. This came about through the Federal Government's accord with Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1985 the Government agreed with the ACTU to 3 per cent of wages being paid as new or improved superannuation as part of a productivity agreement. This agreement was subsequently broadly endorsed by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. By 1989 this agreement saw about 65 per cent of wage and salary earners covered by awards under which employers were required to provide superannuation. Many other awards have since been altered to include superannuation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, many employers have ignored their obligations in this regard, which has seen many workers who have forgone an increase in cash wages in preference to superannuation contributions actually miss out on their rightful entitlements. I remind the House that that 3 per cent was a wage increase forgone by a lot of workers and that those employers who have not passed that on to the workers have actually disadvantaged their workers quite substantially for a number of years and will certainly affect their long term retirement prospects as far as stability in retirement is concerned. Those workers certainly were entitled to those increases, and those who have not got them will certainly need to get them in the future. That is why in the Budget the Government has taken the action that it has taken. </PARA>
<PARA>  Attempts to overcome these problems to date have achieved little, if any, result. In the light of this, the Government has decided to introduce a superannuation guarantee levy which will be effective from 1 July 1992. The levy will help strengthen the retirement incomes policy by providing an efficient method of ensuring that employers comply with their obligations to provide award based superannuation to employees and extend coverage to employees not currently covered by these provisions. The legislation will also offer an effective mechanism by which the level of employer contribution support can be increased over time to meet changing retirement incomes policy objectives and the capacity of the general economy to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the spread of employer contribution to superannuation increases over time, we can expect to see an increase in the amount of contributions made by the employees themselves. This pool of savings will help ensure sustained economic growth and reduce our dependence on borrowing from overseas, thus producing a twofold beneficial effect for Australia: firstly, the creation of a flexible and sustainable retirement income system which delivers fair and adequate incomes for our retirees; and, secondly, the building of a pool of savings available to support future economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  People need to be assured that the Government is giving more than just tacit support to these reforms, and that the funds to which they are contributing their savings are managing their money properly so that their future income is guaranteed for the rest of their lives. They need to know that the trustees and fund managers of superannuation funds are accountable to the membership, mainly the workers who contribute to those funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government recognises its responsibility when officially encouraging a greater contribution towards superannuation funds to ensure appropriate prudential supervision of those funds. To achieve this objective, the Government will be placing greater emphasis on the accountability, financial stability and efficiency of the superannuation industry. The primary aim will be to improve the security of contributors' funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government does not intend to determine the types of investments that funds can be applied to, except where necessary for prudential purposes. Such action, I believe, would restrict the growth potential of the fund and limit access by the general economy to this valuable source of funds, thereby having a detrimental effect on the members' entitlements and the benefits that would normally flow to the economy. The Government has produced two papers on this issue which were released with the Budget Papers. These will form the basis of the Government's reform of this vital industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  While superannuation will make an increasingly important contribution to the living standards of the retired, there will always be those people who, for one reason or another, have limited opportunities to save. There are also those people who are already retired or nearing retirement whose pool of savings, including superannuation funds, are too low to provide an acceptable level of income. This Government has given a firm commitment to the continuation of the age pension as an income support payment for those people without other sources of income or only limited retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Returning to the role of supervision--the current banking inquiry has shown a real interest in the safety of people's investments in superannuation funds. This is an issue which has been raised on a number of occasions. I do not want to pre-empt any findings arising from that inquiry, but the responses which will come through in its report and the recommendations flowing from them will certainly be interesting. I believe the initiatives taken by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in this Budget will certainly help to highlight that very important area. </PARA>
<PARA>  As our money in superannuation funds increases quite dramatically over the years, it will be important that that money is managed properly and that the investment managers actually diversify their investments to ensure the best returns possible to the membership, but bearing in mind, as I mentioned before, the overall economic strategies for Australia. Superannuation will certainly produce a very substantial savings opportunity for people and it will obviously be the place where most of our savings will go in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  To those critics who suggest that savings societies and banks, et cetera, will freeze up or dry up, I would say that that can hardly be the case because the workers will be negotiating through the trade union movement--which has always been the practice, and it is a practice with a proven track record, particularly through this Government under the accord--as part of their overall wage and salary packages for superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The employers who suggest that there is going to be a massive increase in cost to them are quite incorrect because I expect those costs will be contained within the normal wages growth as time goes on. Already a large number of employers provide superannuation for their employees. They may well gain from this whole exercise because of the superannuation they already provide. Superannuation has certainly been an area where white collar workers, particularly, have had some benefit for many years. In my previous occupation I had superannuation from a very early age while a lot of my counterparts in the blue collar area did not enjoy that same benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  With those sorts of opportunities, despite the opposition to certain aspects of this initiative of the Government, employers are not going to find themselves with higher wages bills than they would have had with normal wages increases. That money will be put aside in superannuation funds where the overall savings of Australians will increase. It is hoped that those savings will go into our economy to help develop our industries as the fund managers determine over time the best places to invest them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Overall, this has been a very interesting Budget. It has provided a lot of long range opportunities. I think the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) should be commended on the package he has put together in this Budget because there are a lot of initiatives, when one studies them, which are going to help a lot of people in the longer term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Tonight, in preparation for the opportunity that this debate presents for honourable members in the House to respond to the Government's Budget, I took the opportunity to prepare myself to talk particularly about how the Budget will affect my constituents, the people living in the electorate of Gilmore, rather than, as other honourable members have chosen to do, talk about a whole range of issues that feed from the Budget speech but do not necessarily relate to their electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think it is very important that we, as members of parliament representing many thousands of people in our electorates, focus our attention on precisely how significant statements such as the Government's Budget will affect the very people we represent here in the Commonwealth Parliament. Probably the most significant thing that I find as I travel around my electorate is the degree of economic anguish that I witness and hear from my constituents; I think it is unprecedented. Certainly it is unprecedented in my time in this Parliament, which dates back to 1984. I suspect it is unprecedented in the time of any honourable member of this Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the level of unemployment causes the greatest concern throughout the community today. Right through my electorate of Gilmore there have been some dramatic increases in the numbers of unemployed persons. For example, in the Shoalhaven area, over the last 12 months there has been a 36 per cent increase in the number of unemployed people. I am not talking about a few hundred but a few thousand. I am talking about a total of some 5,700 people in the Shoalhaven district who are unemployed and seeking employment at the moment. That is an extraordinarily large number of people for a shire the size of Shoalhaven. Indeed, in the Shoalhaven district, youth unemployment is in excess of 40 per cent. In the Ulladulla district, which borders my electorate--it is actually in the electorate of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)--the local paper has been running stories of youth unemployment levels of some 45 per cent. This is a typical example of what is happening throughout the coastal portion of my electorate of Gilmore. </PARA>
<PARA>  But it is not isolated to the coast. If we go into the highlands--into the southern tablelands--we find that there has been a 37 1/2 per cent increase in unemployment in the Goulburn district over the last 12 months. This is very evident when I talk to the voluntary agencies that provide assistance to people in need throughout the Goulburn district. The demands that are being placed on their services are now well in excess of what they were 12 months ago. It is coming to the stage that it is beyond their capacity to service the demands being imposed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Moving farther westward in the electorate of Gilmore to places such as Young and Cowra, we find there has been a 46 per cent increase in unemployment over the last 12 months in Young. I have only got to walk up and down Boorowa Street, the main street of Young, to hear local businessmen telling me that business is as flat as a pancake and that unfortunately they have to lay off staff. The same story applies in towns such as Cowra. They are good, strong, vibrant rural communities. They are mixed farming areas with a wide range of rural activities that would normally ensure that if one industry such as wool was having a hard time then another industry would be having a good time, thus balancing out the local economy. It is not the case today. </PARA>
<PARA>  The case today in a place such as Cowra is that over the last 12 months there has been a dramatic increase in unemployment of around 30 per cent. They have not seen these sorts of unemployment levels since probably the Second World War. People in Young, Cowra, Boorowa, Crookwell, Goulburn and Nowra are saying today that business circumstances are unlike anything else they have experienced in their lifetimes. People in small business are going broke. I see vacant shops as I move around. Farmers are going broke. Almost weekly we have people writing to us and ringing me up. They stop me in the street to tell me of the difficulties they are having as a result of this recession. They cannot operate their farms; the bank is calling in the loans; and the banks are asking them to sell their properties. They say to me, `How can we sell our properties? There are no buyers'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just down the road from my own farm just out of Young a neighbour was forced to sell his farm. There were no bids at all for the property, yet in ordinary times there would be an abundance of people looking to buy that property. It is an unbelievable set of economic and social circumstances that now prevails throughout my electorate. I do not think it is any different from any other electorate in Australia. These are very difficult times indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why are these difficult times? It is because of high interest rates. In the case of farmers who are so dependent upon exports it is because of the high value of our dollar. This stems directly from the Government's deliberate policy of having high interest rates which artificially forces up the value of the Australian dollar. It is because of low commodity prices; it is because of the high cost of production. The disadvantages that our farmers face are basically because of the high cost of production in Australia. They are costs that farmers, exporters, miners and so forth cannot pass onto their customers; they are high costs that they must wear themselves. The whole thing is an absolute, human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of us in the bush and throughout Australia have been conned by the Government. During the last election campaign we had none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself, that man of honesty and integrity, telling us that there would be no recession under a Labor Government; that we could vote with confidence for Labor because it would never give us a recession; and that we could vote with confidence for Labor because it would never give us 10 per cent unemployment levels. No, the Labor Government would never do that sort of thing! No sooner had the unwitting Australian public voted for this Labor Government which was making these bold promises than it discovered that we did have a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  When it came beyond the point of being able to deny it, the Government admitted we had a recession and told us that this was the recession we had to have. This was the recession which these people had promised us during the election campaign that we would never have. This was the one they admitted they deliberately engineered. </PARA>
<PARA>  All the people who are suffering today are suffering doubly because they were conned during the last election campaign by a Government that is prepared to go out and say anything for the sake of political expediency. It is a Government that is prepared to deliberately engineer a recession. Through its own ineptitude, it could not manage the economy satisfactorily enough to avoid the crash that occurred because of its failure properly to read the economy in 1987 when interest rates ran too low. In 1989 it slammed on the interest rate brakes too hard, leading to the recession that we have today. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a recession which could have been avoided.  It was not avoided because of the ineptitude of the people who sit opposite here tonight. It is without question the worst recession since the Second World War and it now leaves nearly one million Australians unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is the worst since the 1930s as the honourable member for Murray reminds me. As one travels around in country Australia the word `recession' is overtaken rapidly by the word `depression'.  Even tonight's news showed the plight that the Australian wheat industry is in. We have a drought and the lowest commodity prices that anyone can remember for many years. The recession in the bush is rapidly becoming a depression--a depression leaving rapid increases in unemployment levels leading to nearly one million people unemployed throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What does this Budget give us that can give those people who are unemployed, those small businessmen and those farmers who are in desperate trouble hope? What does this Budget give us? This Budget gives us nothing. It gives us no hope whatsoever. Indeed, on reading the Budget, the Government freely admits that it will add another 100,000 people to the scrap heap of unemployment in the course of the next 12 months. That is a human tragedy of unbelievable proportions. Those will be the official figures. We all know how clever this Government has become at cooking the books when it comes to unemployment figures. We all know how so many people are farmed off into other categories of social welfare to keep those unemployment levels down. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also know how high underemployment is within our economy today. We know that there are many people who once had full time jobs who now have part time jobs because their employers can no longer afford to employ them full time, but cannot afford to lay them off because of the high redundancy costs involved. We have not just those official figures for unemployment throughout the country, but we also have unofficial figures of people who are underemployed as a consequence. Anybody's guess could be the number. I note that ACOSS indicates that there are around 400,000 Australians who may be underemployed as a result of the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA>  The number of long term unemployed is showing a dramatic growth. That is the most worrying thing of all because amongst those long term unemployed are many people who have no hope of ever getting back a job if we ever climb out of this recession, as I hope we will. Those are the sorts of people who, for a lifetime, will suffer the consequences of this Government's economic mismanagement. The Budget holds out no hope for them. The only comfort that they can draw from this Budget is the fact that the Government will give them more colleagues, more friends, to stand in the unemployment queues to keep them company--an extra 100,000 people at least. </PARA>
<PARA>  With more prospects of job losses, this Budget is one of no hope whatsoever. Indeed, in addition to the job losses that the Government predicts, some of the initiatives that the Government claims as being the strengths of this Budget will lead to further unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), praising the Government's initiative on superannuation. Praise it he may, but I tell you what, there are a lot of employers in Australia today wondering how on earth they are going to be able to pay the extra compulsory 5 per cent superannuation that this Government will impose upon them as a result of its legislation that will soon be brought into this House. The extra 5 per cent is just another tax on employment. The extra 5 per cent tax on employment will not lead to more jobs but will lead to fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to read in the Telegraph Mirror an article put in by Westpac which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Westpac's September Market Insights report said an employer paying a worker $500 a week actually has to pay $700 after including the cost of superannuation, sick leave, long service leave, payroll tax and workers' compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>  "These costs are a tax on employment," said Westpac's chief economist, William Evans in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  He said superannuation was an increasing burden on businesses that would result in rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that businesses will have an increased incentive to shed labour. That is exactly what this Government's superannuation initiative will result in. It will not lead to an increase in jobs, it will see jobs being taken away from workers throughout the country. That is what this increased superannuation levy will do. It comes at the most inopportune time and without any compensation in productivity gains for employers to help them absorb the increased costs of this superannuation. It will see more and more businesses go broke, more and more farmers go broke and more people on the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is coupled with the Medicare charges which the Government promised us at the last election that we would not have. Of course, it broke that promise along with so many other promises and announced that we would have a $3.50 Medicare charge, going up to $5. Having done that, the Government went to water not because of the health professionals' arguments, the ACTU's arguments or the social welfare industry's arguments, but because of the fear that the Prime Minister has of being rolled in the Caucus over this decision. The Prime Minister is so weak in his leadership of the Government that he cannot stand up to his own Caucus on a matter of principle such as this. </PARA>

All we know is it will do something that will make life in the cities better. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does that do for my constituents?  They do not live in the cities. They live in rural towns, villages and regional cities. There is no mention in the Government's propaganda about this mad cities campaign that will help my constituents, yet they are the ones who probably suffer the most as far as services and infrastructure are concerned. Take Goulburn. We have a chronic shortage of hostel care accommodation and nursing home accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The same applies to the rapidly growing retirement belt on the coastal division of my electorate. In the smaller towns of the western end of the electorate of Gilmore one finds that when people get old they cannot retire in their own home town but have to retire to a nearby major town because there are no services for them in their home town. Yet the Government will spend $817m on improving life in the cities when people in the cities take for granted the sorts of infrastructure, conditions and services that people in my electorate dream about. There is not a hope of good news for my constituents in that mad cities program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, all this is just a pay off to the looney Left. It is a pay off because the Left supports the Prime Minister in his leadership battle against the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Payment for that left wing support is this mad cities program and the elevation of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) from being a Minister to being the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to go back over the years to remember when the last time was that Australia had the leader of the left wing as Deputy Prime Minister of the country. One has to go back to the days of Tom Uren when he was the Deputy Prime Minister during the term of office of the Whitlam Government. The fiasco of the Whitlam Government is being duplicated here today in Canberra and is evidenced by the fact that the ascendancy of the left wing is now complete and evidenced in the Budget statement of only a fortnight ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget does very little for farmers. Under normal Budget conditions, if we wanted to see what the Budget would do for farmers we would go straight to the primary industries section of the Budget Papers. Unfortunately, for the very first time this year if we wanted to see what this Budget would do for farmers we would not go to the primary industries section of the Budget Papers, we would go to the social welfare section. What state is our country in when we have to go to the social welfare section of that Budget to see what it can do for farmers? That shows what a desperate state this country is in. It shows how desperate times are in the bush for our farmers and for rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the meantime, whilst farmers, small businessmen and the unemployed are doing it tough, the wharfies of Australia revel in their huge redundancy payments. We average $100,000 to voluntarily get every wharfie over the age of 55 to retire from the waterfront, in addition to their normal superannuation payments, sick leave, long service leave and so on. Wharfies have been very well treated by this Government. The unemployed, the small businessmen and the farmers have not been well treated but the Government's trade union mates, as exemplified by the wharfies, do it really well in a time such as this. There is no recession for the wharfies of Australia, particularly when we bear in mind that last year the average wharfie earned $47,000. In order to earn it he had to put in an average week of 27 hours. That is not a bad job in a time of recession. He has to work fewer hours at present because there is less trade across the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is not good news for the constituents in my electorate and it is not good news for Australians. It does nothing to solve our industrial relations problems; it does nothing to reform the industrial relations area; it does nothing to improve our transport system; it does nothing to reform our tax system which is in chronic need of reform; and it does nothing to introduce new productive initiatives for Australia, such as allowing Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale to go ahead or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Budget is a deal to prop up the leadership of the Prime Minister so he can hang in for his job whilst every other Australian loses his. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-A landmark feature of the 1991-92 Budget is the action in relation to the provision of superannuation. The changes outlined build upon this Government's achievements in massively extending the coverage of occupational superannuation. The developments take account of the fact that Australia has an ageing population. The percentage of Australians aged 60 and over will increase from about 15 per cent currently to an estimated 24 per cent of the population by the year 2021. The establishment of universal access to occupational superannuation, to which all Australian workers will have some private provision for retirement, is a visionary achievement. I join with a number of my colleagues in indicating that this vision will be the feature of this present Budget which is remembered by future generations of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, there are still issues of fairness and equity in relation to occupational superannuation which have to be resolved. I have raised this issue in the House on a number of occasions. It should be recognised that superannuation receives very generous taxation treatment from the Commonwealth. In 1988 the Government's social security review estimated the annual value of taxation concessions for superannuation at somewhere between $1.6 billion and $4 billion. As I have highlighted in this place in the past, the problem with this form of taxation concession is that it is highly regressive. Rick Krever, a lecturer in law at Monash, has described the upside down effect of government subsidy through tax concession. Commenting on the tax on superannuation funds in the February 1989 edition of Australian Society, Mr Krever stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The tax . . . represents an enormous concession to wealthy taxpayers who would normally be subject to a 49 per cent tax on employment and investment income. The attraction of this low rate drops with the taxpayer's income, as the gap between the 15% and the marginal rate narrows. For middle income taxpayers the subsidy element of superannuation savings has been substantially reduced. For low income taxpayers, the subsidies have been eliminated entirely. Only the rich continue to enjoy significant tax handouts. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1989, the last time I raised this matter, I suggested that it is unfair that, having gone through other aspects of income support and ensured that any benefit that derives from government is appropriately targeted, we should ignore government assistance to superannuation which is not given the same appropriate targeting. I hope that at some stage we will still be mature enough to be able to have that debate. In its Budget analysis, ACOSS expressed concern at the inequity of distribution of the tax concession. ACOSS proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a tax rebate system as a much fairer and more efficient alternative to the current superannuation tax deductions. The promised review of the superannuation tax arrangements may be an opportunity to raise these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that these issues of equity and fairness have yet to be properly addressed does not detract from the achievement represented by the extension of superannuation. They must, however, be addressed. Superannuation is a genuine form of national savings. Between 1983 and 1988 the total assets of superannuation funds increased from $25 billion to $80 billion. The changes announced in this Budget will add to this pool of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  The national policy of the ALP calls for the establishment of a national development fund. It is reasonable to consider legislation which will require a proportion of the rapidly growing pool of superannuation investment portfolios to be paid to a national development fund. As is outlined in the ACOSS briefing kit:</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to remember that superannuation funds would attract very few contributions if the Government did not provide tax concessions in order to achieve public policy goals. In this sense, the funds should be seen as having certain quasi-public responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>A national development fund could be used for venture capital for investment in defined industry and service areas and for major physical and social infrastructure projects such as those envisaged under the better cities program. This Budget confronts the issue of building better cities. Australia is one of the most urbanised nations in the world. During the 1960s it was estimated that 85 per cent of Australians lived in cities and towns above 5,000 people. Two-thirds of these people lived in the eight largest cities. Little has changed. Over 60 per cent of the national population live in major cities. Our major cities have large and increasing suburban populations. This brings with it inefficiencies. Already residents of Melbourne use 2.2 times more fuel for commuting than that which is used in the average European city. </PARA>
<PARA>  State government studies estimate that 500,000 new households will be built in Melbourne before the year 2030. Seventy-two per cent of these will be built on the urban fringe. The cost of providing appropriate infrastructure for an urban fringe site in Melbourne in 1988-89 was $52,100 per block--$23,000 from public funds. It costs twice as much to provide services to a block on the urban fringe than it does to develop an urban consolidation site. The price of unchecked urban expansion is a lack of services. As early as 1973 a cities commission report warned:</PARA>
<PARA>If the cities of Australia continue to grow in their present way, the opportunity for the economic and social advancement of an increasing number of Australians will be severely curtailed. It is already apparent that sub-standard neighbourhoods are growing around the central cause of the major capital cities and with many people living in conditions of poverty, poor housing, and a lack of social and recreational opportunities. Without positive government intervention this urban decay will spread. </PARA>
<PARA>A 1987 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure highlighted two main conclusions. The first conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of our infrastructure is younger than that of comparable Western nations. It is not much younger, however, and there is no reason to believe that Australia will be immune from a build-up of rehabilitation or replacement needs of the type that has occurred in other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The second conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA>Maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this century due to the overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure. Unless the need due to ageing can be offset by savings elsewhere, through lower demand, aggregate need for public investment must rise. </PARA>
<PARA>Building better cities is a crucial task facing the national Government. The importance of this task was recognised in the election campaign address of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in March 1990, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>  There is a new generation of social issues facing those who live in the outer areas of our cities. I now commit my Government to provide, with the States and voluntary groups, a new level of Commonwealth support. </PARA>
<PARA>In part, this commitment is realised in the better cities program. The Scullin electorate exemplifies many of the problems facing the suburban fringe of Australian cities. It is no accident that projects in the Scullin electorate feature prominently in the proposals submitted by the Victorian Government for consideration under the better cities program. These projects include the extension of the Plenty Road light rail to Mill Park, accompanied by a feasibility study on a further extension to South Morang, and the possible redevelopment for medium density housing of surplus land at the 300 hectare Janefield disability centre. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of discussions with the Prime Minister, I know that he is aware of these proposals and recognises their potential. These projects will make better use of established urban land and infrastructure and improve people's links between home, child-care, training and the workplace. The Government is to provide $56m in 1991-92 and up to $816m over five years under the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Investment in infrastructure also means the creation of real jobs. Therefore, a spin-off from the better cities program will be the creation of employment. The establishment of the National Rail Corporation is another major public infrastructure investment which will create jobs. But it is in the area of employment that the Budget has failed to address the concerns of the Australian people. The prospect of an average level of unemployment of 10.5 per cent this financial year, as predicted in the Budget Papers, is spine chilling. Before the Opposition takes solace from this criticism, it must be said that serious policy discussion excludes consideration of the nonsense spouted by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>  The best that can be said for the Budget response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is that he wants the Australian people to believe that he can create a Ferrari- owning democracy and that this is to be achieved by cuts in Government spending of the order of $3 billion and by making every visit to the shop a visit to the tax man. </PARA>
<PARA>  What comfort can the unemployed take from this sort of policy prescription, clouded as it is by the economic jargon and mumbo jumbo of a professor of economics? Absolutely nought! In fact, it would undoubtedly mean the prospect of far greater levels of unemployment. The unemployed understand the irrelevance and the danger of the Opposition's position. They know of the poverty, hardship and social unrest inflicted on Britain by the Thatcher Government in the name of the same hardline ideological prejudices cherished by the coalition. What the unemployed understand and expect is that it is this Labor Government that they must rely on, but it is simply not enough that the difference in policy direction is that the Government has more compassion than the Opposition. (Quorum formed) It is instructive, as one turns to the plight of the unemployed, that the best the Opposition can do is to pull the stunt of calling a quorum. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1979, the Prime Minister in his Boyer Lecture The Resolution of Conflict, said of the postwar period:</PARA>
<PARA>Full employment was the cement that bound our society together, enabling us to face the challenges of a changing world and, to some extent, came to nurture a degree of compassion for the less privileged amongst us. That cement is crumbling, and as it crumbles we can discern the beginnings of fracture in our society. Indeed, it is not difficult to perceive the emergence of two societies--the employed and the unemployed--something akin to Disraeli's two nations. </PARA>
<PARA>To avoid this now the Government's major priority must be to tackle unemployment. It must be recognised that this recession has not affected all Australians equally. There has been no equality of sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my electorate unemployment has nearly trebled since 1989. The grim reality is that the local CES offices have next to no jobs for people. The boards are empty. We must not let these people believe that their jobs are gone for ever and that they will never work again. These people do not want to hear that we care more. The Government cannot be so captured by its own rhetoric as to be blind to the need to change. </PARA>
<PARA>  Disadvantaged job seekers, the young, women and the mature unemployed, especially from non-English speaking backgrounds, must be given some hope. In the past Australia has looked to the Australian Labor Party to govern in times of crisis. This Labor Government must do more to confront this crisis. The Government cannot expect average Australians to suffer at the hands of the market when the market has clearly and repeatedly failed them. The Government must rediscover the virtue of economic planning; it must pursue an interventionist industry policy through the development of sectoral strategies to enhance Australia's export performance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The steel and heavy engineering strategies have shown that such initiatives can provide a major boost to import replacement and export expansion. There are policy options which warrant urgent and serious consideration. These include: the introduction of an accelerated depreciation allowance for new investment which adds to the productive capacity for domestic or international markets; the expansion of the export facilitation scheme; and the consideration of tax exempt special savings accounts similar to those operating in the United Kingdom to mobilise the savings of small investors. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome last week's reduction in interest rates. The full effect of the reduction has been passed on to the business sector. If it responds appropriately this will provide an important boost to investment. In addition, the full effects of the reduction in interest rates should be passed on to home buyers immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is not a time for profit taking by the banks. Rates always seem to go up with bewildering haste but come down only after exhaustive consideration. It must be recognised that as inflation continues to fall in line with the forecast, interest rates in real terms will increase. Because of this, the prospect of a further reduction should be kept under consideration. The Budget contains welcome increases in funds for job market and retraining programs. Outlays on assistance to job seekers and industry will increase by $199m--a real increase of 58 per cent in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  But is it enough? As shown in chart 4 on page 3-119 of Budget Paper No. 1, this package is, in relative terms, more modest than the one developed by the Government in 1983-84. The chart indicates, in 1984-85 prices, that over $700m was spent on labour market assistance to job seekers in industry in 1983-84, compared with just over $400m committed in the Budget. In my electorate there are Skillshare programs, for example, which are providing valuable reskilling and support for long term unemployed people. The programs are full but the absolute numbers of people they can help are small. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality is that there will still be large numbers of people seeking training and retraining who will not be able to find places in appropriate programs. There is a need for an expanded strategy for retraining workers who have been displaced, workers with limited literacy and, in particular, those who have lost jobs in the traditional manufacturing sector. Older workers, women and the young--the most disadvantaged job seekers--must be protected. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I stated in a speech in this House in May this year during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1991, economic hardship strikes hardest at those most advantaged. Often people from migrant communities are among the most disadvantaged job seekers. In my electorate many of the people who have been made redundant during this recession are migrants who came here in the post-Second World War period. In many cases, these are people who have been at the same place of employment for 20 to 30 years. This has been a secure environment which has engendered a family spirit. It has given them a sense of belonging and many have become highly respected for their hard work and their ability. Problems with literacy and language skills were not highlighted in this environment. Many of them worked in textiles, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. Many cannot expect to return to jobs similar to those which they have lost. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a competitive job market with limited job opportunities the lack of language skills makes these people a very disadvantaged group which calls for attention. What matters to these people are outcomes. They look to this Labor Government for help. It is not sufficient to measure what the Government is doing simply by the amount of money expended on programs;  we must ensure that what is expended is well targeted. We must measure the success of the programs, not in dollar outlays, but in outcomes. Mr Deputy Speaker, as I have observed, historically, Australia has looked to the Australian Labor Party to govern at times of national crisis. Now, again, it looks to a Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In Aboriginal affairs, the last 12 months has been significant for two things: for the first time in nearly a decade this House reached a unanimous position on a difficult piece of Aboriginal affairs legislation to establish a council of reconciliation; and we have now had the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission operating for its first full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  With ATSIC, several things are becoming obvious: its direction; what is going right; and what is going wrong. At the moment it would seem that ATSIC is lacking any sort of cohesive vision, for after 18 months it is still lacking a corporate plan. It was promised within six months of the full Council being elected and it is still not here, in spite of that six months being up. That is symptomatic of everything that is happening in Aboriginal affairs because, in many ways, we are just treading water. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no question that there are some things going right. ATSIC has shown that it has some capacity to allocate priorities in a way that the previous department did not and it is unique in that its client base is demanding that services deliver and perform. It seems to be showing some desire to be truly accountable--although it has certainly had some hiccups in this area. It is moving to push for agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on the delivery of services in Aboriginal affairs and it has a group of dedicated commissioners who want to see the new Commission work.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are also some things going wrong. ATSIC got off to a bad start with its elections. No matter how hard one tries to put a gloss on it, the fact is that the turnout in remote Australia, where the turnout was best, was still 40 per cent less than the turnout achieved for land council elections held by breakaway land councils only three months earlier. In essence, people vote if they see some relevance to their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) does not have an independent source of advice. The Minister is accountable to the Parliament for the expenditure of a body over which he has no direct control. ATSIC still has to work out itself what it wants to be--whether it wants to be a department or a statutory authority;  whether it wants to deliver programs or represent Aboriginal people. It has a difficult relationship with the Department of Employment, Education and Training which is not working and it has created raised expectations throughout the Aboriginal community that will be very hard to meet now that the reality of trying to deliver programs has to be met. </PARA>
<PARA>  The area of program delivery--the area that we in the coalition see as vitally important in Aboriginal affairs--was summed up very well last Saturday week by Charles Perkins in Alice Springs. Charles Perkins is a great Australian and a great Aborigine. He said that the three factors of Aboriginal employment, education and health are inextricably linked. They are the keys to Aboriginal well-being. The three, with Aboriginal culture as their foundation and inspiration, must be the focus of policy, programs and thus expenditure in a triangle of interdependency. To emphasise one without the other is a waste of money and effort, and guarantees few positive results. A similar theme was put very well and very eloquently by the Australian of the Year, Professor Fred Hollows, who said simply, `Bugger the reconciliation, just fix the leprosy'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some time ago I spoke of a desire for us to work towards realistic and achievable goals in Aboriginal affairs; yet we still seem to be following grand plans in this area. Some months ago I travelled to Hermannsburg, west of Alice Springs, with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). The two of us, both formerly doctors before we entered this place, worked for the best part of a week in an Aboriginal health service where we did calls after hours, visited the outpatient clinics and the out- station clinics, and treated the people who came in. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hermannsburg is unusual in that it has very good statistics on Aboriginal health going back to the 1940s. Today, after 25 years of effort, people are dying younger than they were 25 years ago. People in their thirties are still dying of complications of diabetes--something that neither of us had ever seen in medical practice in the city--and kids were being brought in every day with potentially life threatening diarrhoea;  something that one never sees in the developed parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recognised this when, some time ago, he said that to be born Aboriginal means that a person is statistically doomed from birth. Yet in spite of everything we are doing--in spite of all our efforts in places like Hermannsburg-- things are actually going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some bright spots in Aboriginal affairs. The Government's recent language policy--although my colleague the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), expressed the coalition's concerns about the general policy--contains some long overdue reforms in Aboriginal language. At the time of Captain Cook's landing 200 years ago there were 250 totally distinct Aboriginal languages spoken in this country. Today only 50 survive. That sort of language loss is unparalleled anywhere around the world.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is my concern that in 100 years time our descendants will look back on us and say, `You were in a position to do something about that, why didn't you?'. We have had a good start. We still need a national focus and a national language centre, but I am quite willing to give credit where credit is due. The reconciliation shows that if there is a little goodwill on both sides this Parliament can take a step forward together which I hope will be a lesson for people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are some not so bright spots in Aboriginal affairs. The size of the bureaucracy in one year in the Department of Employment, Education and Training is up 16 per cent. A breakaway land council was recently refused by the Minister. That is a small issue for us in Canberra but, essentially, it means that if one is an Aboriginal person and one threatens an existing power structure, no matter what the rhetoric is, one will be denied any legitimate right to manage one's own affairs. A recent report into the community development employment program--the biggest single program in Aboriginal affairs--showed that management needed to be improved; there was not adequate accountability; there were not adequate assessment programs; and there were not adequate goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  Occasionally, one finds a little gem in the Budget Papers. I found one this year in Budget Related Paper No. 7 where we are told that there is a program to increase Aboriginal public awareness of climatic change. This is needed because Aboriginal communities are a high risk group in relation to the impacts of the greenhouse effect. There is, therefore, a need to inform this group of the possible consequences and encourage appropriate response strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is really wonderful, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I can say, as a doctor who had an interest in skin-related disorders before entering this place, that in 15 years in the Queensland melanoma project not a single Aboriginal person got melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma is totally unknown in Aboriginal people and squamous carcinoma is so rare as not to warrant a mention in the textbooks. Perhaps we have a program to build houses on stilts in the Torres Strait islands, I do not know;  but the fact that something like that could slip through and money could be wasted on a policy like that when there is such desperate need shows that perhaps we are still not quite hitting the mark in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to pay tribute to Jean Sinclair, an extraordinary Australian.

In particular, I wish to pass on my condolences to her husband, Professor Angus Sinclair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Jean was senior adviser in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Perhaps that title conceals rather than reveals. Most of us would have had dealings with the Prime Minister and, therefore, dealings with Jean. She had the happy knack of making the humblest backbencher feel important and, at the same time, judiciously sparing the Prime Minister from his natural inclination to see all who wish to see him. She treated prince and pauper alike--where necessary, firm as you please with the former, and always compassionate and caring with the latter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Jean had been the Prime Minister's administrative assistant since 1973, when he was President of the ACTU. She came to this position with a solid background in business. She stayed by the Prime Minister throughout his period in the trade union movement, his brief period as a backbencher and Opposition leader, and for the eight years so far of his prime ministership. In all that time she never lost her organising skill, her political nous and above all her keen perception and sense of humour. Working for the Prime Minister was for her a labour of love, but she also had a deep and abiding love of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I sought to have the Prime Minister visit my constituents, it was Jean who would somehow make this possible, while generously providing advice and her time, as well as simultaneously coping with equally pressing demands from my colleagues--demands on the Prime Minister's time to meet visiting dignitaries, attend in this House, chair Cabinet and all the other demands. All the time, too, she was balancing the many other areas where the Prime Minister's public and private life intersected. To him, and to others, she was, as the Prime Minister's biographer Blanche d'Alpuget says, `firm, pleasant, well organised and very quick witted'. In the words of the Prime Minister, `Jean is simply irreplaceable'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The term `untimely death' has become a cliche, but indeed her death was untimely. Only a few weeks ago she was seemingly as energetic as usual. What few of us knew was that she was then bravely battling cancer. Yesterday even someone as determined, vigorous and courageous as Jean Sinclair lost her battle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last Thursday members of this House, namely the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), deservedly congratulated the Baltic communities of Australia on the gaining of independence of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. May I also add my congratulations to those three communities and make the point that throughout the past 18 months when firstly Lithuania announced its independence, followed by Estonia and Latvia, the Baltic communities in Australia have conducted themselves in a manner that is deserving of the greatest admiration of all Australians. They have consistently made their point patiently, quietly and peaceably without violence of any kind, and yet with a determined resolution and courage to assist international recognition of their beloved homelands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The illegal annexation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union under the terms of the notorious Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact of 23 August 1939 has finally been ended after 52 years. Baltic communities throughout Australia have shown their appreciation of the work done by all members of this House when they congratulated the Australian Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on recognising the Baltic States, especially having done so before the European Community and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>  I grew up in the Le Fevre Peninsula area of Port Adelaide where many Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian families lived and still live. As a young primary school child I remember three young Estonians who, like me, became dux of Largs Bay Primary School. They were Mark and Prit Hennoste and Mai Taimult. Mark went on to become a doctor, but tragically Prit Hennoste was killed in a road accident whilst still in his teens. Mai Taimult works in Canberra. Mark and Prit's mother was a teacher and for a short time we were colleagues at Taperoo Primary School. I remember two Latvian families, the Ozolins and the Nimanis families. The mother of one family, Mrs Irina Ozolins, who became a secondary teacher, was great friends with my late grandparents. I might say that they lived, appropriately, in Sawford Street, Largs Bay. The connection still continued, because Irina and my wife were both friends and teaching colleagues together. I spent one year at Woodville High School with Ojars Nimanis and later played basketball--although pretty badly--in a team in which we both participated. We still remain good friends. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, it was the Lithuanian community in Taperoo and wider Port Adelaide which was to have a greater influence upon me. Aldona Kasciukaitis's parents, Petre and Bruno, accepted me as their son-in-law and as such I came to know the many families who, without any other relations in Australia, provided friendship and support and became non-blood relations to each other. Those families--the Ramanaskuas, Sveikauskas, Junokas, Macpanas, Jakaitis, Reinkes, Baronaitis, Baltrasaitis, Kondratavicius and the Zakarevicius families, the last of which I could never say and always referred to them as `Mr and Mrs Zak'--became close friends. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure they would all have been saying in the last week in far better Lithuanian than I can speak, `Mano Mylima Tevyne Lietuva Dabar Yra Laisva'--my beloved country Lithuania is now free. I am especially certain that in Estonian and Latvian communities throughout Australia, along with the Hennoste, Taimult, Ozolins and Nimanis families, there were others saying something similar in their native tongues of Estonian and Latvian. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real point to be made is that not only have the Baltic communities contributed greatly to this country but the manner in which they have supported their homelands from Australia, especially during the difficult circumstances of the past 18 months, has, without exception, been exemplary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted tonight to have these few minutes to discuss the latest initiative by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on language and literacy policy. Unfortunately, I can only give the Minister about a C-plus in any kind of a grading system. The language and literacy White Paper by the Minister is a disappointment. It held out much promise from the Green Paper of last November which offered many options that he might have considered for improving literacy in this country which is devastated by an adult illiteracy rate approaching 15 per cent and a student illiteracy rate which is unknown because of a lack of national testing and national evaluation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Further, the policy paper is trivialised by a bureaucratic attempt to redefine English as Australian English, standard Australian English, standard Aboriginal Australian English or some other kind of English rather than English. All of us in this place have been through the school system. I maintain that all of us went through the school system at a time when we were taught grammar and phonics, we were taught how to spell, we were taught English and we were taught how to read and to write. Unfortunately over the past two decades we have given way to the bureaucracy and to the leftie, trendy, unions which have given us a holistic approach to language which has decimated our literacy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our children are deprived of a learning opportunity which they deserve by right. Our adults have been deprived of the opportunity to participate fully in the employment market and to participate fully in society because of a severe lack of appropriate use and knowledge of English--not Australian English, but English. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a shame that the Minister's definition disregards numeracy because in discussions of the committee of which I am the deputy chairman we have found throughout Australia that one of the greatest deprivations of Australian students in our society today is a lack of numeracy--an inability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. It is costing us dearly. It is costing us in the universities;  it is costing us in jobs in industry; and it is costing us in the schools. But the White Paper that held out so much hope disregards numeracy. It is not an issue. What is at issue is Australian English. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also a disappointment to me--I think it would be a disappointment to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price), who is at the table--that Minister Dawkins failed to recognise the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in a report brought down in this place earlier this year entitled Words at Work. That is a very serious work. We spent many months investigating adult illiteracy and the effects and causes of illiteracy throughout our society in Australia. Instead of paying attention to that report, the Minister has again resorted to the bureaucracy and the teachers unions which have produced a policy paper which is flawed in detail and its use of English. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report is full of double-speak, imprecise language and inadequate meanings and inadequacies. This House deserves better, the Parliament deserves better and our nation deserves better because we need to preserve high standards of literacy. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to support the statement made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) concerning a very fine Australian, namely, Jean Sinclair who served the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for many years not merely in this institution in a range of services. She came to the Prime Minister's staff when he was President of the ACTU where she had to handle the range of problems that come across the table of the person holding that important position in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  She came to this institution when the Prime Minister became the honourable member for Wills. I suppose it is true to say that Prime Ministers, in the difficult range of tasks they have, have many advisers and many minders, but I think that Jean Sinclair played a special role in the Prime Minister's office. I think that thousands of citizens--from honourable members on both sides of the House to people in Melbourne and Australia generally--when they had a problem which they believed deserved the special attention of the Prime Minister chose to talk to Jean. They knew that she had a fine intellect and was a person of great compassion and great judgment. In that respect, I believe that she won the admiration not merely of members on both sides of this House, but of citizens of every strata and level of Australian society. Whether it was a humble constituent from Wills, a trade union official, a rank and file member of the Labor Party or a business magnate, Jean Sinclair adopted the same unassuming approach. She listened with compassion and sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not often that Prime Ministers are fortunate enough to have someone such as Jean on their staff. Never at any stage did she seek preferment in the political structures of this place or anywhere else. She was content to serve and carry out an important role not merely in the Prime Minister's office but within the framework of this institution and within Australian society. I know that her loss will be felt by many members of this House and, in particular, by the Prime Minister. This is an occasion on which we should place on record our appreciation of a great Australian of fine intellect. She was a person of humility and compassion and always had an ear open for those who have to make political judgments which could affect people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I extend my sympathies to Jean's husband, Gus, and to her family. She faced the last period of her life with stoicism and courage. She will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On Monday morning this week I flew from my electorate to Sydney en route to Canberra. As we were over the Hawkesbury the plane that I was in diverted and started to circle. Two or three years ago that aircraft was doing the same thing. The plane was standing off because it had been directed to do so by the air traffic controllers at Sydney (Kingsford- Smith) Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is shameful that we have not seen some action from this Government with respect to that extra runway at the Sydney (Kingsford- Smith) Airport. It is a shame for Australia that the major airport of our nation is unable to take the traffic that wishes to come into this country. Over 50 per cent of our international passenger traffic comes through Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, airline companies are standing off Sydney because of the situation that exists there. Many of us are concerned about that aspect of the effect upon the economy of this country because our planes are not allowed to use it with the freedom to which they are entitled. But I am also concerned about those commuters who run interstate and intrastate into Sydney Airport all day long and about the extra expense that has been occasioned to them because of the inefficiency of that airport--an expense that has ricocheted throughout Australia to other airports via the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a great shame that we in this country have a situation in which this Government refuses, because of political aspects, to proceed with that extra runway for that airport. I appeal to the Government to wake up to itself for the sake of our passengers and for the sake of what tourism means to Australia. Efforts are being made by the New South Wales Government to improve the metropolitan area of Sydney for the people from overseas who want to come here. We share very little of the world's tourist trade, and we can share more. But Sydney Airport is a hindrance to us. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those Government members whose electorates surround that airport and who are so active because their council and, they say, their citizens want them to stop the future development of the airport must have a bit of common sense and realise that it is their responsibility to do something about Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>  Time and time again we members, particularly those of us from country electorates, have said to the Government, `For goodness sake, proceed with this work'. Plans were out to proceed with the extra runway back in 1982. I was on a committee that dealt with this. It was about to go ahead. The costs were worked out and the plans to do it were there. They might not be the same plans as are there now. The plans that are being raised by the Airports Corporation at the moment for the provision of the extra runway going out into Botany Bay are excellent, as far as I can see. That is where it should go. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government had better do something about it because I am quite sure that at the next election it will become an issue. It must become an issue, because people are fed up with this. We know that Badgerys Creek will not go ahead for a number of years. When it starts to go ahead, in line with the history of other airports throughout the world, it will be years before it is ready for use. When it is, we will have to get proper transport from the metropolitan area out to the Badgerys Creek area. The State recognises this and the Federal Government also must recognise it. Therefore, I again raise the matter, and I appeal to the Government to overcome the obstacles that are instigated politically at the moment and to go ahead with a project of which this country is so worthy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to say a few things that the honourable member for Dawson might be interested in--and I am sure he takes a very keen interest in interest rates as well. I would like to draw credit cards to the House's attention and to support both the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) in his capacity as chairman of the Government's consumer affairs committee. Both the honourable member for Capricornia and Senator Tate have been making their views known quite strongly on what they believe is injustice with Bankcard and Mastercard interest rates. I support their views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Whilst the honourable member for Capricornia and I may have had a disagreement recently on a particular press article in which it was suggested that because bank staff enjoy lower interest rates as part of their salary package, interest rates for Bankcard, for example, should be lower. Notwithstanding that, the honourable member for Capricornia assures me that that was a bit of political----</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, it was a response from a journalist more than anything else, but it was not intended to come across that way. Certainly, the honourable member for Capricornia's charge against the banks about their credit card rates is correct. An article in today's Queensland Sun quotes some interest rates. For instance, Westpac's Bankcard rate is 24.6 per cent and its Mastercard rate is 21 per cent; all the National Australia Bank's cards--Bankcard, Mastercard and Visa--are 24.6 per cent; and the Commonwealth Bank charges 23 per cent on both Bankcard and Mastercard. It appears that there has been no reduction on interest rates for credit cards since interest rates started to come down. It is about time that the banks started to allow some of those savings to flow on to people who need them most. Clearly, their argument--and the campaign that they are waging--is for the opportunity to have an up- front fee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This article makes a number of references to the fact that, if there were an up-front fee, interest rates would drop. The allegations of Mr Park from the National Australia Bank suggest that politicians do not know what they are talking about when they talk about credit card rates. I think we do, and I think I can speak for members on both sides of the House, because we probably are pretty good users of them, and we also have a lot of constituents who use them quite regularly and raise these sorts of issues with us most of the time. So I think that Mr Park should talk to some of our constituents and some of his customers if he thinks that they are happy with the present rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Lance Bauer, the Chief Manager of Consumer Banking at Westpac Banking Corporation, is a gentleman whom I know very well. He is a fellow Queenslander--I think he came from the electorate of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). He is a fine fellow, but he certainly is pushing the banks' barrow here in supporting a call for a $30 annual fee. Mr Bauer's suggestion here is that, if a $30 fee was to come in, it would mean a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates on credit cards. </PARA>
<PARA>  That seems strange when at present we see that Westpac has a Bankcard rate of 24.6 per cent and a Mastercard rate of 21 per cent, which is a difference of 3.6 per cent. The reason for that is that there is an interest free period on the Bankcard of up to 60 days, if one times things right, but there is no interest free period on Mastercard. So we would see only a 2 per cent reduction, in any case. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the calls by both Senator Tate and the honourable member for Capricornia for rates of around 15 per cent would be much more realistic. There has even been some suggestion that the interest free period on Bankcard could be eliminated and passed on to consumers that way. The banks' allegation is that 70 per cent of consumers are actually paying for 100 per cent of the bill because 30 per cent of people actually use the benefits from the interest free period. But I think it is about time that the banks really did the right thing and passed on the benefits of the reduction of interest rates for Bankcard and Mastercard. I am sure that that would be welcomed by most of the consumers throughout Australia. (Time expired)</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes.  Maintenance income is means tested to enable public expenditure to be targeted effectively to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, maintenance income is assessed under a separate maintenance income test and is not taken into account under the ordinary income test that applies to pensions, benefits and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>  The separate maintenance income test was introduced in June 1988.  The separate assessment of maintenance income is important in ensuring that there are no workforce disincentives to sole parents.</PARA>
<PARA>  For this reason, pensions, benefits and allowances are reduced by one-half of the amount of maintenance received above the maintenance income test free area (currently $16.05 per week for the custodian and first child plus $5.35 per week for each additional child).</PARA>
<PARA>  The maintenance income test free area is indexed in line with the Consumer Price Index at 1 July each year.  This ensures that the level of child support payments that do not affect pension or benefit will be maintained in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) No.  Maintenance income is taken into account separately from earnings and other income which are assessed under the ordinary income test. Maintenance arrears payments are assessed under the maintenance income test in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA>    If collected through the Child Support Agency (CSA), the first arrears payment of maintenance is disregarded.  This treatment of lump sum payment of arrears eliminates the financial disadvantage that would otherwise occur due to the structural `delay' in the legislation in relation to receipt of the first payment of child support through the CSA;</PARA>
<PARA>    Where payments have been irregular, a formula is applied to any subsequent arrears payments to compensate clients for the loss of the maintenance income free area which would have been available if the maintenance payments had been received on time;</PARA>
<PARA>    If clients are not satisfied with this method of calculating their entitlement, they may seek a review to see how their rate would have been affected if the payments had been assessed over the period that they should have been paid.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) No.  The Treasurer has advised that any moneys received by the CSA are paid immediately into the Child Support Trust Account pending disbursement to the custodian. The process is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>    Payments of child support for any month are due to the CSA on the 7th day of the following month;</PARA>
<PARA>    During the last week of that month the CSA advises the Department of Social Security of the amounts to be paid to custodians;</PARA>
<PARA>    Payments are made to custodians on the first Wednesday of the next month (ie payments are made to custodians within a month of being collected).</PARA>
<PARA>  The period between receipt of child support by the CSA and payment to the custodian is used to ensure that payments are credited against the correct child support liabilities, that late payments are included in the system and that checks are made to ensure that child support is paid to the correct custodian.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer has provided detailed information relating to this matter in his answer to Question 359 on 3 September 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) No.  All custodians are free to make private arrangements rather than take legal action to obtain maintenance.  In recognition that some custodians need to seek legal assistance to obtain a court order or registered agreement for maintenance, additional funds have been provided to the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services for this purpose.  The great majority of custodians registered with the CSA are sole parent pensioners who generally qualify for legal aid assistance which covers the costs of legal action to obtain a court order or registered agreement for maintenance.</PARA>
