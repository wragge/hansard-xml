I refer him to his statement last week that the Government would not offer income tax cuts before the next election. I contrast that with the statement by the Treasurer-in-waiting, Mr Willis, that there possibly would be income tax cuts and with the fact that Senator Button, in the Senate this afternoon, did not rule out the possibility of income tax cuts before the next election. Will the Prime Minister end this confusion and tell the House whether the Government will offer tax cuts before the next election? If so, how will he pay for them?</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3246" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question has particular relevance in the wake of the very strong commitments recently made by those opposite to the principle of road user charges. As the honourable member indicated in his question, a great deal of work on the efficient and effective provision of road infrastructure has appeared in the last 18 months. The conclusions of that work are clear. If I may borrow words from the Opposition's document, at page 83:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charges and taxes on road users and the level of expenditure on roads will no longer be subject to the vagaries of the political or budget processes which have produced wild fluctuations in rates of charge and levels of expenditure in past years.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to ensure that, there is only one option, and that is to impose a proper system of road use charges on all classes of users. Charging just heavy vehicles is not good enough. Light vehicles, including cars, provide 75 per cent of the revenue that would be required to fund road expenditures under the model that those opposite propose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of those opposite who seem to be so confused about this and about the scope of the work of the Inter-State Commission, let me make absolutely clear what the work of the Inter-State Commission encompassed. Its work encompassed all road users from the family car through to road trains, as can be seen, for example, in the table on page 171 of its March 1990 report, which I table. It can be seen from that table that its work encompassed the whole area of road vehicles. It goes from cars and station wagons up to articulated trucks of seven axles or more. So it is clear that the work of the Inter-State Commission encompassed all road users, from the family car to road trains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission produced estimates of the levy that would be required on both diesel fuel and petrol to recover the purely distance element in road use charges. The details of the charges are contained in a table on page 181 of the Commission's report that I have tabled. From that table it is quite clear that it was applied to all classes of vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Following the July 1991 Special Premiers Conference, we announced agreement on the establishment of the National Road Transport Commission and we asked that it determine charges for heavy vehicles by March 1992, with a view to having the new system for heavy vehicles in place by 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the principle of revenue neutrality governing the Premiers Conference processes, the pure distance element in the road user charge collected as a levy on diesel is to replace a component of the present diesel excise, so there will be no consequent change in the price of diesel fuel. In other words, there will be no add-on; it will be a replacement of a component of excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For lighter vehicles the issues are more complex and the revenues much larger, as can be seen from that table. It was judged desirable that work on these issues continue, as it sensibly should have done, in the context of the work on Federal-State financial relations. Again, the clear understanding is that a road user element in petrol prices will replace a corresponding element of petrol excise. There will be no add-on; that would be a replacement for an existing area of the excise duty. All these decisions were announced in detail in the July communique. It is not something that has been hidden away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the central thrust of the question by the honourable member for Hunter. What does one need to do in the area of roads to further the objective of securing an efficient land transport system for Australia? That is an objective that I thought we shared with those opposite&mdash;although, in terms of their convolutions in the last 24 hours, it is very difficult to tell whether that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer as to what needs to be done is that fundamentally one needs to ensure that services are provided efficiently and that they are charged for properly as they are used. We are very close now to achieving that for heavy road vehicles and we are pursuing the details of its implementation for lighter road vehicles with the States. We have established the National Rail Corporation to ensure complementary processes in regard to rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the midst of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's confusion last night about what we and the ISC had done and said, by implication he acknowledged that road user charges on diesel fuel were a fact of life. There is no argument about that. But that being the case, the simple and obvious question is: why was it not included in the Opposition figuring? It is accepted that the diesel road charges are a fact of life, but there is not a single mention, not a single element in the calculation of the impact on prices. Why? Was it dishonesty, ignorance, or a combination of both?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incoming Coalition Government, therefore, will request the newly established National Road Transport Commission to review a national system of road user charges to apply following the implementation of our tax reform package. The Commission would be guided by the need for the system of road user charges to be equitable, efficient and simple to administer. The Commission would be free to recommend that charges take any form or combination of forms.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be free to make those decisions. I have news for the House. It is worse than that. Not only will it be not free to make them, but also the National Party tail, having last week announced that it is going to use the recently established National Transport Commission, today has wagged the Opposition dog. The Leader of the National Party tells us now that the coalition says it will oppose the Government's Road Transport Commission Bill when it comes into the Senate this afternoon, having said that it is going to use the National Road Transport Commission that we are going to establish. That is what is in the Opposition's document released on Thursday, but on Tuesday of this week it announces that it is going to oppose the establishment of the Commission. Where does the Opposition stand on this issue? On Thursday the Opposition said that the establishment of this Commission is central to its position; on Tuesday it says it is going to oppose its establishment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the health policy?  The Opposition appears to ignore the impact on the CPI of forcing consumers to take out private health insurance.

Let me leave no-one in any doubt: this Opposition plan, manifesto, preposterous document&mdash;call it what one will&mdash;is a fundamentally intellectually dishonest document. The Opposition is attempting to con the Australian people into believing that these charges, these changes, will not affect inflation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most dishonest part of the entire scheme is the Opposition's failure to admit that its policies will result in higher inflation. If the almost 5 per cent increase in inflation already admitted to by the Opposition translates into higher mortgage interest rates&mdash;as it must, given the promise of the Leader of the Opposition on page 130 of his document that monetary policy will be kept firm as he introduces his 15 per cent&mdash;inflation will jump dramatically. If home mortgage interest rates increased from, say, today's 12 per cent to 15.5 per cent&mdash;the same rate as this time last year&mdash;this would add about 1 3/4 percentage points to the impact on the CPI.

So where does all this leave members of the Opposition and their 4.4 per cent inflation figure? They want the Australian voter to turn his back on the lowest inflation rate in 20 years and to ignore the fact that our inflation rate is now below the OECD average and below that of our major trading partners. They want the Australian public to accept a 15 per cent tax on food, clothing and all the other necessities of life. They want the poorest members of society to suffer the brunt of cuts to social security and other government expenditures. And what for? So that the Leader of the Opposition can preside over double digit inflation, just like the last Liberal Prime Minister of this country, and so that the Opposition can deliver the not-so-average man on $75,000 a year a tax cut of $135 per week while the worker on $20,000 a year gets $15.60.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, the analysis by Mr Gittins reinforces an earlier article by the economic editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 5 November. The fundamental reality which Australians need to be aware of is that, if the Opposition introduces a new consumption tax in the absence of an effective wages policy, interest rates will need to be high&mdash;the economy will need to be brought to a halt&mdash;to stop inflationary expectations increasing and an explosion in wages growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member. Yes, I have seen a recent reference to the proposition that Australia's productivity performance has been poor and I refer to page 16 of the glossy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. It refers to Australia's poor productivity and quotes the OECD. What is the figure?  For 1983-90 it is 0.9 per cent. That is Australia's poor productivity performance. Then we get the great document revealing what those opposite are going to do to transform the face of Australia, how they are going to change our poor performance. So I looked with great interest to see what they are in fact proposing. It is like the words from the old song&mdash;the low road and the high road. They have the base case. They have the low road and they have the high road.</PARA></TALK.START>

They look at various things such as private consumption and private dwellings and the figures going to move a certain way. They will have the high road case. I come down and I find there is an entry on productivity and I see what they say they are going to achieve in terms of productivity growth. Under the base case, the worst case scenario, the figure is 0.43. What is the low road? The low road is 0.40. But what are they going to achieve under their high road scenario&mdash;0.8.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is probably one of the very few honest points in this fraudulent presentation because it is inevitable that if in fact the Opposition were ever to be given the chance of imposing upon this country its mix of policies which would have the effect of dramatically increasing inflation, which would then mean a tightening of monetary policy and higher interest rates, of course we would have the situation in which we would have a disastrous economic outcome. All I can say is that the one thing we are indebted to the Opposition for in its document is that out of its own mouth it has shown that it would produce a lower productivity performance for this country under its policies than we have achieved between 1983 and 1990. Those opposite  cannot have it both ways. If they say that Australia's productivity performance is poor and they ask to be given the opportunity of bringing their policies into place, and the best scenario they can produce is a lower rate of productivity than we have achieved, then they are condemned, as they should be, out of their own mouths.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aim of the JET program&mdash;jobs, education and training&mdash;as its advertising slogan suggests is to enable sole parents to go back to work without neglecting their most important job, that is, looking after their children. It is based on a fundamental principle that all Australians should be able to care for their children, but that nobody should be excluded from the work force if that person is able and willing to participate. The jobs, education and training program is a voluntary program. The mother has a choice, often a difficult choice, but nevertheless she has a choice. Often the mother will find it almost impossible to work because of recurring illnesses with children, because the children are not doing well at school or because of a range of other factors. So the Government provides a safety net of the sole parent pension. The contrast of the policies announced by the Opposition last week are indeed very stark. It would deny sole parents the opportunity to care for their children. In its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document it proposed to increase the dependent spouse rebate for families with children up to age 25 years so that the wives of all those on incomes of up to $75,000 have the choice&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing wrong with that. The honourable member asks, `What is wrong with that?'. There would be an opportunity provided by way of the dependent spouse rebate for families with children, up to the age of 25 years I remind the honourable member for Bennelong, so that wives of all those on an income of up to $75,000 have the choice of how to care for their children. But in the same statement sole parent families with children who have reached the age of 12 years are told to choose the tax payer, effectively, ahead of children. They are told, `Go and get full time work regardless of your children's needs'. That is in fact the instruction that is included within the so called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. We have a justification from the Leader of the Opposition in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> where he says, `In many two parent families both parents work while their children are still at school. In line with these developments it is no longer fair for sole parents to continue to receive the sole parent pension once their youngest child turns 12'. Or as Senator Richard Alston said to Ramona Koval, `My children are not psychologically scarred and my wife works from 9 to 5'. So we have the situation where the Opposition has put forward a proposal to the Australian people that says that the circumstances of a sole parent, someone responsible for bringing up children alone and someone who has children at that stage when they move into the early stages of adolescents and the early stage of puberty, essentially at a point which is critical in the life of a child, someone who has the responsibility alone to care for that child without any support and who takes the responsibility within the family for the child&mdash;I think the Leader of the Opposition would understand what the situation is&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the first time in the history of the Australian Parliament that a political party has essentially said that a mother&mdash;and 90 per cent of sole parents are mothers&mdash;must put her responsibility to the taxpayer and her responsibility to work above her feelings for her children. Regardless of her care for the children, that is the choice that she has to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that we have not had some success in terms of policy. One of the curious features of this Opposition is that when Government ideas have been successful the Opposition has picked them up&mdash;perhaps putting its own twist on them. The jobs, education and training program suggests that it is important for sole parents to work. People should look at our record. The proportion of sole parent pensioners with earned income increased from 9 per cent in 1983 to 21 per cent this year. The labour force participation rate for sole parents in total rose from 44 per cent in 1983 to 55 per cent in 1991; that is, the majority of sole parents are already in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue, which is very clear, is essentially about the responsibility of parenthood. At the beginning of my answer I referred to parental responsibility, the slogan that we used in JET, where parents do not neglect their most important job, that is, looking after their children. The Leader of the Opposition says, `I am sorry, but that responsibility is not a priority for this coalition.' Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, as every member of this Parliament knows, has what is called in politics a glass jaw. The first occasion on which the Leader of the Opposition had a question put to him about this policy by a sole parent was on Friday morning on the Sattler program. Anne rang up. It could have been Margaret, but it was Anne. She rang and asked, `What are we to do?'.</PARA>

Clearly, subsequent events have superseded that, and fuel will be cheaper not only for those using it as an input but substantially cheaper for all people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today I am announcing major changes to the organisational form and management arrangements of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The changes follow an intensive process of review initiated by me last December and reflect the broad thrust of proposals contained in submissions from industry and unions; from independent consultants Ernst and Young; and from the Quarantine and Inspection Policy Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the changes to Australia's trading interests should not be underestimated. Food inspection and certification&mdash;covering animal, plant and human health&mdash;provides the basis for continued entry to overseas markets. Quarantine protects producers and consumers, and our environment, from exotic pests and diseases. It also helps in meeting overseas requirements for our products to be free of pests and diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a leading world producer of food. Not only do we provide about 95 per cent of our local needs, but also we are the world's second largest exporter of meat, the fourth largest of wheat and a major international source of dairy produce, grains and a range of other food exports. Food exports and related produce generated over $9.5 billion in export income in 1990-91. It is in this context that AQIS has a vital role to play in safeguarding Australia's trading interests and protecting Australian industries and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Control or exclusion of animal and plant diseases, and pests which are endemic in other countries, contribute to the well-being of Australians and give our producers a competitive advantage in markets overseas. The growing concern about food safety worldwide underlines the importance of maintaining firm control over chemical residues and other contaminants in foodstuffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quarantine policies and operations keep out exotic pests and diseases which could damage or destroy agricultural industries or fisheries. It similarly helps to protect the natural environment. Inspection of export foodstuffs, plants and animals to meet the requirements of other countries is a prerequisite for trade. Inspection of food for domestic consumption, whether produced in Australia or imported, protects Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS has an annual budget in 1991-92 of $179m, including $41m to fund quarantine and inspection operations performed on behalf of the Commonwealth by State and Territory government agencies. There are approximately 2,400 direct employees, and the equivalent of 700 quarantine and inspection staff employed by the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of providing quarantine and inspection services are recovered from users wherever appropriate. The introduction of full cost recovery from January 1991 has greatly intensified scrutiny of AQIS's efficiency by those who pay its bills. The amount subject to cost recovery this financial year is $147m. AQIS's activities must be conducted as efficiently as possible and with a strong focus on its clients' circumstances and needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS is now five years old. It has achieved the objectives set out in its first strategic plan five years ago. Its quarantine risk assessment procedures are amongst the most progressive in the world. A single quarantine service integrating animal, plant and general quarantine functions has been implemented. Many quarantine procedures have been streamlined and the establishment of private quarantine stations has been facilitated. On the inspection side, the recommendations of the 1982 royal commission have largely been implemented and the reputation of the Meat Inspection Service has been re-established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following modifications to inspection standards and procedures and the progressive introduction of new approaches based on quality assurance systems, the number of AQIS inspection staff has declined from about 2,250 to below 1,650&mdash;even though throughput is higher. AQIS's prompt and professional response to the residue crisis which threatened Australia's meat export trade to the USA in 1987, and in other similar situations before and since, has maintained access for our products in overseas markets. An inspection scheme for imported foods has been established and there are many other achievements which could also be mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenges AQIS faces now are different but no less demanding. New threats must be evaluated rapidly and appropriate action taken. The stakes are very high: a single lapse in quarantine effectiveness which permitted entry of foot and mouth disease in cattle or Newcastle disease in poultry could decimate Australian industry and cause losses running to billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, however, quarantine decisions must not unduly impede trade nor impose excessive restrictions on the importation of new genetic material needed by Australian primary producers. Furthermore, AQIS must maintain the confidence of Australians that its risk management decisions are well considered and based on sound science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's favourable pest and disease status compared with that of many other countries and the high quality of our primary produce give us a marketing advantage overseas which can be nullified by arbitrary and unjustified quarantine restrictions or food standards applied by authorities in importing countries. If the GATT Uruguay Round is successful in restricting the use of conventional measures to protect domestic agriculture such as markets access restrictions, protectionist-inclined countries may try to erect alternative barriers in the form of quarantine controls or food standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS must use bilateral and multilateral forums to spotlight and oppose any trade barriers disguised as sanitary or phytosanitary measures. The excessive inspection requirements imposed on our meat exports by the USA and the EC will be a major focus of attention for AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of quarantine and inspection services is significant in total, even if it is not a substantial component in the cost structure of user industries. AQIS cannot merely limit the rate of increase of costs; it must continue to actively pursue real cost reductions by all possible means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, AQIS is very much part of the Government's agenda for micro-economic reform. Regulation must be the minimum necessary to meet the circumstances and industry must be encouraged to assume a greater degree of responsibility. Charging policies must encourage efficient use of public sector resources. With that background in mind, let me now turn to future arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Strategy and Vision </EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next five years AQIS will maintain its fine record in protecting human, animal and plant health in Australia and ensuring access for Australian products overseas through its quarantine and inspection functions. But it will become significantly smaller in terms of its staff numbers and in terms of its total cost to users&mdash;without compromising effectiveness or integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substitution of traditional AQIS product inspection by industry quality assurance schemes audited by AQIS will accelerate, with the benefit of the additional development support committed by the Government in the 1990-91 Budget. Operations staff will be more highly trained and will possess a wider range of skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientific competence will be built up. Cost effectiveness will be enhanced by structural change, regulatory reform and investment in human and technical resources. Communication with client groups will be strengthened through formal structures and issue-related strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS will maintain its leadership role in international multilateral activities and strongly pursue bilateral agreements advantageous to Australian trading interests. The Service will adopt a quality management approach to all its activities. The strategies which will turn this vision into reality will build upon the major reforms already under way. To quote the independent management consultants, Ernst and Young:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS is, by its own initiative, a highly reformist organisation. Over the last several years AQIS has been undergoing a process of major change directed towards reducing the cost and improving the quality of inspection services. . . There is a clear vision on the part of top management within AQIS for a more efficient, effective and responsive quarantine and inspection service based on Quality Assurance principles with industry taking greater responsibility for providing traditional inspection tasks.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Quality Assurance </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of AQIS's strategies for the next five years is the continued transition from traditional inspection approaches, serving both quarantine and food standard objectives, to the widespread adoption of quality assurance approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under quality assurance, responsibility for ensuring that a product meets quality requirements rests in the first instance with the producer, who must design, implement and maintain systems for this purpose and demonstrate competency in their use. Quality assurance systems are built into the production process, reducing reliance on end product inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be emphasised that the quality assurance approach in no way involves any abrogation of AQIS's ultimate responsibility to ensure that statutory or other requirements are met. There will be no reduction in the quality or reliability of Australian products as a consequence of switching to quality assurance systems as the best means of achieving regulatory objectives. In particular, AQIS will ensure that quality assurance options are underpinned by firm and effective sanctions policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS has already managed the introduction of quality assurance approaches for fish inspection, dairy exports, export cold stores and, in a specialised form, certain activities in export abattoirs. As a consequence, industry has been relieved of the need to pay for a significant number of inspectors. Changes now approved for domestic meat inspection practices represent a major extension. Indeed, the quality assurance approach to be developed and trialled for use on slaughter floors in domestic abattoirs is probably the most advanced in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While AQIS is managing the introduction of quality assurance options in food and quarantine control in an evolutionary way, the consequences for industry may be revolutionary. AQIS's approach is a catalyst for a major change in culture and methods in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take one example, meat processing is one of Australia's larger and most competitive manufacturing industries. Its production methodology and employment practices, however, are traditional and it has a surplus of production capacity in old, outdated abattoirs spread across Australia. Commitment to quality is often poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely difficult for AQIS to provide inspection services efficiently to this industry on an on-demand basis. Introduction of a quality assurance based approach shifts responsibility to industry in the first instance to address the difficulties of achieving appropriate standards in this operating environment. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Scientific Excellence </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second broad strategy for AQIS is to reinforce its scientific competency. Since the Government adopted the recommendations of the Lindsay Committee on quarantine policy, AQIS has been developing a formal quarantine risk assessment procedure. Assessed risk has always been the basis of AQIS's decisions about particular quarantine issues such as the conditions, if any, under which importation of commodities from overseas can be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the increasing requirement to be able to fully justify quarantine restrictions to domestic constituencies and international trading partners requires formal risk assessment based on sound science. In this regard AQIS is served by the Bureau of Rural Resources and by its own existing scientific staff in the provision of scientific analysis, and it will enhance its capabilities in this area. Similar considerations apply to food science and technology in AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International developments underline the crucial importance of scientific excellence for AQIS's activities. There is now a strong probability that, as part of an agreed outcome in the Uruguay Round, the GATT contracting parties will conclude an agreement to prevent the misuse of food standards and quarantine control as unjustified technical barriers to trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that agreement on so-called sanitary and phytosanitary measures, countries which are not following international standards when setting food standards or quarantine restrictions may be challenged to justify their approach. The justification must show that national requirements are based on sound science, risk assessment and consistency in risk management. AQIS may be called upon to provide such an explanation. Therefore it must ensure that the sanitary and phytosanitary measures which it applies have a competent scientific basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that a new GATT agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures can be the means by which Australia can exert leverage to improve our access to markets overseas, provided we have superior technical and scientific argument in support of our case. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A More Business-like Culture</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major theme among strategies for the future is the need for AQIS to adopt a more business-like approach. The report from Ernst and Young put its main emphasis on this point. AQIS will be more business-like in future, and not only because it must now cover its `commercial costs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Business-like' means cost-consciousness; it means efficient resource use; it means market and customer orientation; it means a commitment to serving the interests of its stakeholders; and it means being competitive and entrepreneurial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be communicating with the State and Territory Ministers responsible for the agencies which deliver quarantine services in the field to discuss the adoption of a more business-like approach in their activities also. Considering Australia's need for sustained improvement in our export performance, the Government believes that AQlS's more business-like approach must be focused primarily in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Export Facilitation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a widespread perception that AQIS's operations unduly inhibit the export potential of Australia's food and livestock industries, whereas controls over competing imported foodstuffs are more relaxed. Similar concerns have been expressed in relation to quarantine controls. These perceptions, which are incorrect, probably derive largely from AQIS's role in ensuring that the requirements of other countries which are importing Australian produce are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, AQIS intervenes in the export process to ensure that Australian products are of a standard such that they will be permitted to enter foreign markets. In addition, there is an overriding international obligation to ensure that food exported from Australia is fit for human consumption and that animals and plants which are exported are healthy. In pursuing these goals, AQIS will carry out its functions in a manner which aids export activities to the maximum extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS will develop and implement an export facilitation program, a particular feature of which will be the better utilisation of AQIS's considerable professional knowledge in the spheres of food and livestock trade. AQIS already provides detailed advice on demand to intending exporters on conditions of entry applying to foodstuffs and livestock in overseas markets, and it circulates information to trade associations on prospective changes to entry conditions as they become known. It is likely that entry conditions will tend to become more restrictive and complex as consumer awareness of potential hazards associated with foodstuffs increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To improve access to advice on these matters, AQIS will now identify and train individual officers at regional locations and in AQIS's Canberra office as export facilitators accessible through a toll free telephone line. Callers will either receive an immediate response or be transferred to an officer who has special expertise in a particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second element of the program will be the preparation and dissemination of advisory notes on regulatory matters which frequently cause problems in export trading. The information program will be guided by a survey of exporters' needs in this area. AQIS will also develop its linkages with Austrade, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the various statutory marketing authorities for agricultural commodities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To develop a more business-like approach to financial management within AQIS, the Government has decided that AQIS will operate under the financial discipline of a trust account into which cost recovery revenues will be paid and from which expenditures will be funded. The Government will still meet the cost of `government business' and quarantine surveillance by Budget appropriation. The non-user attributable components of AQIS costs will be reviewed in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discipline of operating on a trust account basis requiring services to be self-funded will reinforce cost-consciousness in AQIS. For many who pay for AQIS's services, however, the central consideration in a more business-like approach is whether AQIS is offering its inspection and other services not only at least cost but also in the precise form which best suits the purchaser. Abattoir operators, for example, expect inspection services to be provided wherever and whenever they want them, and some at least do not expect to be charged for on-costs such as superannuation or for administrative overheads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's view is that the full costs of providing services must be met by users. The meat processing industry must meet the costs which AQIS incurs because of the geographic dispersion of the industry, seasonal fluctuations in activity, inefficiencies caused by abattoir design, and so on. It is not reasonable to make taxpayers bear the burden. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also timely to revamp the Quarantine and Inspection Policy Council which has served as the peak advisory body to the responsible Minister for the past four years. A new body, the Quarantine and Inspection Advisory Council, will be responsible for advising me on AQIS's broad strategies, the direction and priority of programs and services, resource issues, technical developments, and economic and industry considerations. Unlike the QIPC, the new Council's membership will be selected on the basis of specific expertise rather than, as was the case in the past, to represent particular client groups. It will be expected to consult widely, including with industry, and it will be kept fully informed of AQIS's relations with client groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first tasks of the new Council will be to review established consultative arrangements between AQIS and interested parties and suggest any appropriate improvements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the QIPC, Mr Bill Meynink, CBE, and the members of the Council for their valuable service to the Government and the nation in the interests of quarantine control and food inspection. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Management and Industrial Relations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To implement the strategies I have described, a number of important administrative changes will be made to AQIS. The most significant will be the creation of a new position of business manager responsible for human resources, financial services and information technology. The business manager will also have responsibility for the oversight of commercial consultancy developments. One major focus for the business manager will be industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in prospect for AQIS are of fundamental concern to its staff. Over the past five years AQIS has managed the introduction of major change with minimal industrial disruption by emphasising planning, consultation and communication, together with a program of investment in human resources to fit AQIS's capabilities to the needs of the 1990s and beyond. One major element in AQIS's training effort is the development of purpose built tertiary level courses in food technology, which a significant number of AQIS inspection staff are successfully undertaking. These policies will continue. The process of introducing new methods and rationalising across all AQIS functions will accelerate and so will the reduction in staff numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the changes I am announcing today, I expect that the inspection work force will decline by about 25 per cent over the next two to three years. It is difficult to be more precise because the demand for inspection by AQIS depends on the rate at which industry takes up quality assurance options. The Government has provided in the order of $20m to fund a redundancy program over the period to 1993-94. The Government is shouldering this burden of adjustment as part of its desire to foster greater efficiency and competitiveness in Australia's food and livestock exporting industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS has recently completed an award restructuring agreement with inspection staff which provides for a number of significant changes. A new unified structure will provide the framework for employment of inspectors as food standards officers with the capacity through additional skill training to work across the range of commodities. The upgrading of skills has a particular focus on expertise in auditing, as the logical complement of AQIS's push to make quality assurance options available to industry as an alternative to intensive, on-line inspection procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The award restructuring package also encourages a significant reduction in supervisory staff at meat processing establishments and increased flexibility in supply of AQIS services by means of provisions for seasonal and part time employment and for relocation of staff when, for example, establishments serviced by AQIS close down operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Executive management structure will also be revised. A corporate management group comprising the Executive Director and the heads of the quarantine, food inspection and business management groups will have responsibility for corporate decision-making. AQIS's regional directors, who have line responsibility for implementation of food inspection programs, will have a somewhat broader mandate in future and, in particular, will have a collegiate role in overall program delivery. Where AQIS has been the subject of debate in recent times, a central issue has been whether AQIS should be converted to a statutory authority . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management consultants Ernst and Young concluded that no significant near term improvements in efficiency would flow from conversion to statutory authority status, and that such status would not be appropriate until the processes of change and improvement in the meat inspection industry are further advanced. The QIPC also concluded that AQIS should not be made a statutory authority at present, but should nonetheless actively pursue options for corporatisation or statutory form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there would be significant costs in administrative effort and much industry opposition to an immediate shift to statutory authority status.

AQIS's role on food safety is reflected not only in the conduct of its regulatory functions but also in promotion of quality assurance approaches, liaison with counterpart agencies overseas and other activities. Within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, AQIS will have the coordinating role on food safety matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be appropriate for me to go into detail in this statement, but these suggestions are at best improbable. The suggested reduction in administrative costs could be achieved only if there was a significant decrease in the effectiveness of quarantine services provided by State and Territory governments. The risk of exposure to overseas pests and diseases would as a corollary increase. Large cuts in salary costs are achievable only by means of a large scale redundancy program and, as I pointed out earlier in this statement, involve even greater up-front expenditure by the Government on redundancy packages.

This Government dumped the 100 per cent cost recovery-user pay requirement on AQIS without adequate preparation being given to that organisation; it required of that organisation a purer than pure role ahead of any successful outcome in the GATT negotiations with regard to&mdash;in the view of industry&mdash;the easy access of some products into Australia thus endangering our disease-free status; and it was not allowed to be vigorous enough in obtaining overseas access for our products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an image that has not been helped by the Government's failure to allow the maintenance of production at abattoirs during industrial disputes by requiring the staff of AQIS to continue to fulfil their role. That image has also not been helped by constraints imposed by the Government, by its accord with the ACTU, union restrictions and arrangements concerning the necessary changes for AQIS to be ready to serve Australia and our great export industries in the best manner possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Minister's statement was being finalised, presumably this morning, the Sheep Meat Council of Australia was having its annual meeting in Tamworth and is calling for a royal commission into the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The Cattle Council of Australia at its meeting in Tamworth&mdash;these meetings were being held at the same time&mdash;carried a resolution calling for an independent inquiry. Neither of these organisations, nor for that matter the coalition parties in this Parliament, have any faith in the Government's handling of AQIS, or of the so-called independent report, which the Minister commissioned earlier this year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was. Mr Steele-Park went on to say that AQIS itself is becoming seriously embarrassed by the adverse publicity and the comments being made against it. When the Ernst and Young report was released in July, Mr Ed Wright, the Chairman of the Cattle Council and also the Chairman of the National Farmers Federation AQIS Task Force, was reported to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Ernst and Young have failed to `grasp the nettle' of sweeping reform for AQIS; something which NFF considers is desperately needed," said Mr Wright.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The consultants argue that the creation of AQIS as a statutory authority `at this stage' was unnecessary to continue the drive for greater efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am puzzled as to why the wishes of the majority of industry, and AQIS itself, have been ignored in their call for the corporatisation of the Service," said Mr Wright.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Cynically, one could argue that Ernst and Young have been distracted by organisations or people who have a vested interest in the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They seem to have placed little credence in the fact that industry, not Government, is footing a bill of $450,000/day for what is perceived to be a grossly inefficient service relative to businesses within the private sector, corporatisation would inject a degree of much-needed commercial reality into the Service without jeopardising its integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister maintains AQIS as a pure public service, as suggested, he would be ignoring the Government's much-flaunted drive for greater commercial reality within the public sector and ignoring industry's potential role in such a drive.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister does make one telling comment and acknowledges one of the real credibility problems facing AQIS today. In the Minister's speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of full cost recovery from January 1991 has greatly intensified scrutiny of AQIS's efficiency by those who pay its bills.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is certainly right about that, because the people who will pay the $147m for inspection charges know and are saying repeatedly and loudly that they are not getting value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meat inspectors receive a salary of about $32,000, but AQIS charges the abattoir $68,000 for each inspector to cover add-on costs such as regional offices and a head office and those on idle time. We have another industry&mdash;the waterfront&mdash;which operates a bit like that. This idle time creates real costs for all industries through the system, including the meat export industry. The Minister, in answer to questions, has admitted that there are 63 meat inspectors who are stationed in places where abattoirs have closed. Some have been closed for five years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In answer to a question asked in a Senate Estimates committee it was admitted that 45 of these inspectors had refused transfers, but the Department claims that most of them are used as relief staff or in nearby abattoirs. However, this is contradicted by information obtained from the Department that shows that they are only half utilised and had been sent all over Australia. That is one simple example of where, if people refuse to move to where the work is, they should no longer be employed when there are so many people surplus to the needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May this year there were 1,654 meat inspectors; 1,249 of those were directly employed in inspection at any one time. This means that there are always 405 inspectors, or 25 per cent, not engaged in inspection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless, it is true. Of these, 87 inspectors were deemed to be surplus to requirements and a further 155 are estimated to become surplus within the next two years. On top of that, there are 162 inspectors who provide relief for those on holidays, sick leave, et cetera. So much for the 45 who were supposed to be doing that. To cover the cost of these inspectors who do not earn a direct recovery from the industry, a figure of $14,200 is loaded on every working inspector. Despite the number of surplus inspectors and those refusing transfers, AQIS employed another 14 inspectors during the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems are not only in the meat industry. I constantly receive complaints from people exporting other products which must be inspected. I am getting quite a number of complaints&mdash;and my colleague the shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), gets these also&mdash;about the charge for weekend air exports and air freight services which are used to maintain fresh contracts, and also to develop export markets with small orders. To be fair, that is not a criticism of the inspectors; it should be a criticism of the Government for arranging that type of uncompetitive inspection cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the documentation system for exports required by DPIE is, to quote one of the kinder comments I have heard, antiquated. The Department is supposedly developing a better system, but it is still between 18 months and two years away. Customs has a system in place now which could easily be extended to include these exports. This system was actually offered to DPIE but it was not accepted. So much for this drive to be more businesslike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has spoken about improvements in efficiency through the implementation of the quality assurance program;  that is, putting emphasis back on the abattoir itself. He makes the valid point that the abattoir owners, the meat processors themselves, also have to take responsibility for ensuring the rapid implementation of this scheme. The Minister says that the number of inspectors has declined from 2,250 to fewer than 1,650 and there is a higher throughput. How does that relate to the fact that there are 2,400 people employed by AQIS, and 700 quarantine and inspection staff employed by the States? Does that mean that out of a total of 3,100 people only 1,650 are inspectors, and that for every person in the field there is another sitting in an office being paid by clients? I accept the point about the other roles of AQIS, but I do believe we need a better answer than the one we have had so far on how effectively that staff is being employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister talked about quality assurance and the implementation of this service. This has been introduced first of all for fish and dairy exports, where inspectors are being removed from the line, and now it is being extended to domestic meat inspection. But there is another problem that is obvious from all these overhead costs that are still there. People involved in those industries say that they are not benefiting from any reduction in costs. Once again, one can look at a comparison with the waterfront, where there may be an improvement in the movement of containers per hour, but it will be from three to five years before there is any reduction in costs to the users because of all the deals and expensive arrangements that have been put in place as part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister in his statement was critical of the coalition for indicating in its Fightback program that there will be net savings of $14m in the meat inspection service. This figure was tested with people in the industry. We were told universally that that sort of figure should be achievable quite easily because of what is known of those inefficiencies. The Minister, in providing his plan for the future and detailing a more businesslike culture for AQIS, referred to an export facilitation program, the establishment of a trust account, the publication of an annual report, a new Quarantine and Inspection Policy Council, and corporatisation that was considered but rejected and will be considered again in 1994. He added to what is already the feeling in industry that nothing really is being achieved by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the coalition policy; what about the coalition position?  We have a commitment to create or require a completely commercial Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service for inspection purposes. The National Farmers Federation and the Cattle Council of Australia, as I have indicated earlier, have the view that at this time&mdash;I emphasise, at this time&mdash;with this Government, the best way to achieve a more commercial system is to corporatise that part of AQIS and to provide contractual arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is maintaining consultation with the industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am referring now to the time frame of a coalition government, which of course will commence after the next election. We have a commitment, and it is our policy, to remove all possible meat inspectors from on-line inspection&mdash;not just meat inspectors, but inspectors of food products&mdash;and also from the employment of AQIS, and to reduce the overhead management in a like form. It is our policy that the inspectors should be employed by the processing company, which will be responsible for its own quality and suffer the consequences if it is found wanting, and that a core of vets and inspectors be retained by AQIS for check testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a fanciful belief on the part of the coalition. Mr Dick Austin, Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, has spoken on the need for this to be achieved and the ability to achieve it. I also want to quote from Dr Paul Hopwood, Professor of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney, who said very recently that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government inspectors are not cost effective because:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they need to be supervised by an expensive bureaucracy,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they work under a public service award,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they may not be responsive to the needs of industry or to the needs of individual works,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they are industrially militant, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. they have a high level of job security which is unrelated to work performance.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hopwood also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If AQIS has to decide between protecting its bureaucracy or providing cheaper meat inspection it will decide in its own favour every time.</PARA>
<PARA>He also suggests that meatworks need to undertake their total quality management as the only way to reduce costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the second part of coalition policy is for AQIS to maintain the disease-free status of Australia. That is just not a role for that organisation; I refer to the positive work that can be done by ACIAR in research projects and joint ventures in countries near Australia, for example, to prevent Newcastle disease, foot and mouth disease or whatever from coming to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that AQIS needs to be utilised to overcome non-tariff-barrier, quarantine-type access problems that keep our products out of markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific Rim countries, where there is tremendous potential for trade. I will follow with interest one of the more positive points in the Minister's statement on the export facilitation program. I certainly acknowledge the slow but at last reasonable progress that is being made with the National Food Authority, and in that regard I would be more critical of State governments than the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of our policy would be to require AQIS to obtain more equitable access to other countries in return for access to Australia for products from those countries where, for example, there was a similar disease&mdash;and one thinks here of the United States and citrus&mdash;or where similar area freedom protocols are being established. The next point would be that if AQIS wants to be treated as a professional organisation, then all of its members will be required to act professionally to provide its service irrespective of industrial action being taken outside abattoirs, as occurred recently, for example, with picket line incidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally businesslike changes to abattoir employment practices will be required under the next government, a coalition government. We have to reduce the terrible difference between the cost of killing and processing a cow in Australia and the cost in the United States. The cost of putting a cow or a steer through a Australian abattoir is 2 1/2 times the cost in the United States. That is a terrible indictment on work practices in this country. We are not talking about Third World countries or cheap labour; we are talking about work practices and productivity. We have to reduce costs right through the cattle industry and, for that matter, all industry in Australia to remain competitive, to create much needed regional employment, and to give the hard pressed cattle producer a little bit of profit for a change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Parliament today we saw the baton of government pass from a tired, discredited government to a new coalition charged with dynamism and enthusiasm to run this country better than it has been run for a very long time. The release last week of the coalition's Fightback package was truly a turning point in Australia's political history. It really was a watershed in the affairs of our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) got to his feet today in Question Time, after hundreds of hours of effort by all these Treasury boffins and their super models and their little models and their big models, he had absolutely no reply. He had no opinion of his own. All he could do was just parrot some old, tired left wing views that he had picked out of the papers this morning&mdash;the same old left wing views and the same sort of socialist ideology that have held this country back for 20 years, robbed people of the incentive to work, robbed people of the incentive to save and seen the worst recession in 60 years, a recession deliberately engineered by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage in the first quarter of an hour that the Prime Minister was on his feet did he do anything but talk rhetoric. He loaded us up with rhetoric. He provided absolutely no alternative whatsoever. As for the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), he is just a broken, pathetic figure who has lost all self-confidence. All he could do was read from a written text prepared for him by the Treasury boffins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), in a disgraceful display, simply tried to mislead people in the most dishonest presentation that I have seen in Question Time for a very long time. He simply quoted press releases that were months old and that everybody knows were not true. Lastly, of course, we had the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who ended up in a shameful display of gutter politics from which he ultimately only reluctantly withdrew. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister that if he has a scintilla of decency left in him, he should come into the Parliament this afternoon and apologise for his disgraceful behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This all adds up to a government which is really in total disarray, a government which is on its last legs, a government that has run out of ideas and a government that is racked by internal faction fighting. If one looked at the faces on the Government backbenchers, one would have seen that they were glum. Their faces&mdash;with the exception of the smiling face of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who waits day by day with his knife sharpened&mdash;told a story of a government that really has run its course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who has just walked into the chamber, ought to have seen to their responsibilities and come into the Parliament prepared to debate the future of this country. It was revealing, was it not, that at the time when Question Time was to start, we moved a motion to provide the Treasurer, the person charged principally with the day to day economic management of this country, with an opportunity to stand and debate the issues in a sensible and considered way. But no, he ran a mile. He would not have a bar of sensible, constructive debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For months and months the Government has been calling for the release of our policy and calling for us to debate the details of our policy. Yet now that we have released it and given the Government an opportunity to do just that, it applies the gag. So the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was justified today in moving a censure motion against the Prime Minister, and again it was no surprise that the Government backed off from the opportunity to debate the great issues raised last week by the coalition in its alternative Fightback program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make three preliminary points to the Treasurer. Firstly, he ought to account to the people of Australia for the massive waste of taxpayers' funds in the propaganda exercise that he is running in the Federal bureaucracy to attack the one good idea put up in recent years to advance Australia out of the economic problems caused by this Government. On Friday night at taxpayers' expense the Treasury was lit up like a Christmas tree while it was working on the coalition's package. That is not the function of the Treasury; its function is to look to the interests of the people of Australia and to prepare constructive solutions and propositions for the better management of this country. Its job is not to use taxpayers' funds to tear down coalition policies. It is a disgrace that in the worst recession for 60 years so many resources are being used within Treasury and the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now found out that there are hordes of people working on this package in the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, in the Department of Social Security and in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. And in what other departments? The Treasurer should answer this. Today he failed to answer the question as to how many people have been diverted to this political propaganda task. How many other people has he put into working on the attack by the Labor Party on the Opposition's policies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Treasurer claimed that nobody was being paid overtime to do that work. That is patently wrong, and the Treasurer should admit it. He has had half an hour since Question Time to find out that this is the case. If we do not get straight answers from the Treasurer, he will get an FOI as quickly as I can say `Jack Robinson'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, let me give the Treasurer some advice, as I think he has a few problems in his own backyard. He has Tony Cole, Greg Smith, Furnell and Ken Henry all working away to prepare the attack on the Opposition policy; but of course they all used to work for the honourable member for Blaxland. Beware of Greeks bearing gifts!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I say to the Treasurer is that he should not be too cocky. One member of his scare campaign team, one of the technicians, actually rang one of our economic consultants to find out how to do what we have been doing in the last few months, and that was so that the Treasurer could attack it. This is incredible. We have these huge taxpayers' resources put into this exercise, yet the Treasurer's staff are ringing the coalition's advisers to find out how to do it. I say to the Treasurer that he should not have too much confidence in the advice he will be getting from some of his boffins down there in Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would say to the Treasurer that for months now Government members have had the idea that somehow our package would be a repeat of 1985. All the Government's rhetoric and all its silly arguments have been locked back into a time freeze of 1985, which just shows how far behind and off the pace the Government is. A lot has happened since 1985. The Government's proposition back in 1985, when the Labor Party itself wanted a consumption tax as part of tax reform, was but a minnow compared with what we released last week. For example, we have introduced a new tax credit system to look after the 800,000 people who in 1985 the Government was just going to throw onto the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have introduced wealth compensation&mdash;the first time that has ever been proposed in the introduction of a value added tax system. We are simply miles ahead of the Government on that point. In 1985 the Government had no anti-inflation strategy. We placed the GST introduction within the context of an anti-inflation strategy built on sound money&mdash;something which is light years from where the Government was in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Government's rhetoric has changed on wages policy, the fact is that back in 1985 the Government believed&mdash;and still does&mdash;in a centralised system. Yet much has changed in the Australian economy since then, in spite of the Government rather than because of it. And on one of the structural reform issues&mdash;privatisation&mdash;in 1985 the Government was running scare campaigns against it. How the world has changed! In the Treasurer's assessment of our package he ought to take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback program we have presented a new approach for this country, a vision of our country in the year 2000. What a great moment it was today when the Leader of the Opposition tabled, by leave, the Fightback program in the Federal Parliament. I must say it was a great honour to be associated with the Fightback program and with the team that the leader of the coalition has gathered around him to bring this great undertaking to reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might look across to the Senate and just name a few senators&mdash;and it is always difficult to name names&mdash;I think Senator Short will be a great finance Minister for this country, Senator Alston will be great in social security and Senator John Watson is a great expert on tax matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this House, for example, I think the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) has a tremendous grasp of policy issues. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has been in the vanguard of industrial relations reform for many years, and it is a great thing to see such reform as part of the centrepiece of the program released last week. What a tremendous job the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), has done in his contribution towards Fightback. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was one of Australia's great foreign Ministers and is one of the great strengths in support of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has done a great job in the environment portfolio. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has made a tremendous contribution and has brought political expertise to the Federal coalition. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) has put up a great health policy for the coalition. What a great thing it is for the coalition to be able to put that together as part of an integrated package. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) sits there as an acknowledged expert, even by Government members, in the aviation and tourist industry. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has done a tremendous job in telling the Australian people about the huge raft of hidden consumption taxes they pay every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a joke it is for the Labor Party to say that it is opposed to consumption taxes when it has put up consumption taxes every year it has been in office. The average Australian family pays between $45 and $50 a week in Labor's hidden consumption taxes, and that is a message we intend to continue to spread around the Australian community. What a great addition the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has been to the Opposition's team. He gives us strength and depth. We have the honourable member for&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to mention the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). He came on board and it just shows that the coalition has a group of people prepared to work as a team. That is very important because ultimately we need a team of people which is prepared to work together in this country's long term best interests. Lastly, let me briefly turn to our leader, whose contribution to public debate in this country has reached a new standard in Australian politics. He has great intellectual force and capacity, but he also has a sense of humour and the ability to bring people together into a team and to share the understanding that, together, these great tasks can be faced and carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has made a great difference to our side of politics. The Leader of the Opposition has the capacity to bring the team together. He has a sense of what is right and what is wrong, and a political shrewdness and understanding of the Australian people that have allowed him to reach an important milestone in the political history of this country&mdash;his release last week of the Fightback program, a vision for the future of this country; something that the Australian people have yearned for for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, as the terms of the matter of public importance say, an urgent necessity for governments to embrace the broad and sweeping reforms which the coalition announced through the Leader of the Opposition last week. We have big problems in Australia. We cannot push them to one side, as the Government does, and say to people, `Look, things are going to be better'. The truth is that for nearly 20 years we have had some fundamental flaws in the Australian economy. Now we have one in three young people unemployed. Our country is literally addicted to debt&mdash;$130 billion and still climbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great thing about Fightback is that it says to the Australian people, `We can fix our problems. If we are prepared to work together and take the tough decisions, this country can realise its great potential and be great again'. We come into the Parliament today with the Fightback program under our arm, proud to be members of the coalition and determined to see the implementation of a great program of reform that will push this country to the year 2000 with greater confidence and higher living standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to take this matter of public importance seriously, but what we heard from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was at the level of a chapter of the Toorak branch of the Liberal Party, so I do not think there is much sense in trying to address the sort of nonsensical garbage he went on with. Apparently the Opposition wants somehow to transform the Parliament into a debating forum about the Opposition's election manifesto. I am afraid that the Government is going to get on with the business of governing. It is not going to transform this House into a place where the views of the members of the Parliament are ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem the Opposition faces is that this so-called matter of public importance has no substance. Its package ran out of petrol after about four days; there is simply no content in it. The most powerful thing said by the honourable member for Flinders was on the question of people in the Public Service working on the Opposition's package. This is a side issue and he used absolutely nonsensical arguments. He threatens this one and that one. Every time anyone criticises anything that is in the public marketplace of ideas&mdash;Professor Head, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and Ross Gittins&mdash;they are immediately attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Flinders that I am not going to jump to his tune. He simply does not understand&mdash;or pretends he does not understand&mdash;what a public servant does. When I was a public servant I was quite happy to do work for a National Party Minister. The Opposition ought to understand that a politicised Public Service is one that will work for only one party. The closest thing we have had to a politicised public service in this country was in Queensland under the National Party. A non-politicised Public Service is one that will work for the government of the day in the public interest, aware of the ebb and flow of political issues, public debate, and the policy positions of the major political parties. We do not want public servants who are eunuchs. We are analysing the package in the interests of the public. This is quite standard practice. I well remember that during the 1980 election and the 1977 election exactly the same thing was done with our election platforms. It is part of the way that the Public Service operates, quite professionally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there was not much content in the honourable gentleman's speech, and there is not much sense in dignifying it with any comprehensive reply. But I think this issue is serious because the choice for the Australian people at the next election will never have been so stark now that the Opposition has finally laid down its marvellous new consumption tax. The lines are tightly drawn and we look forward to the fight. As I said, we are not going to transform the Parliament into a debating society for the deluded people opposite. The whole case for a consumption tax rests and falls on the economic need for it. Just by one test, the tax cuts proposed by the Opposition are almost paid for with expenditure cuts, so by definition there is no need for a consumption tax; all the rest of it is a blind, a hoax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This massive document is just a bulky election manifesto. It has 19 chapters in 345 pages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I doubt the back bench of the Opposition has read it. In spite of its bulk, it makes absolutely no sense. It is a monumental hoax. It purports to spell out what is wrong with the Australian economy and how the coalition would allegedly go about fixing it. But it does not do this. Nowhere in the document does the coalition even attempt to seriously diagnose the problems which face the Australian economy. For example, it asserts that the fundamental problems are high inflation and poor trading performance. But nowhere in the 655 pages does it even attempt to seriously explain what causes these problems to emerge. Nowhere in the document does it even speculate about what are the important causes of inflation in modern open economies. Nowhere in the document does it even attempt to grapple with the determinants of modern industrial structures in our economy and the economies of those with whom we must trade. Nowhere in the document does it confront the complexity of modern international trading arrangements and processes which we face in our striving for better net export performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, in spite of the absence of even an attempt at genuine diagnosis of our problems, it asserts that the cure is simple. It involves the typical monetarist medicine; that is, dismantling the welfare state, replacing much of the present tax system with a regressive indirect tax on consumption, and using monetarist policies to achieve a targeted nought to 2 per cent inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the coalition expect the Australian people to take it seriously when it so vehemently advocates the cure without bothering to even attempt a serious diagnosis of the problem? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is a doctor of extremely dubious practice. Would honourable members trust this professional approach to looking after their own health? Would they be comfortable allowing such a doctor to look after the nation's health service? Indeed, will the Australian people trust such shabby professionalism to exercise control over the whole economy? The answer is a categorical no. By the time the Government has finished taking this document apart&mdash;argument by argument, paragraph by paragraph&mdash;there will be nothing left except a heap of ruined political aspirations on the Opposition's side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we are thankful to the Opposition for finally coming clean with its policy agenda. We have certainly waited long enough. But what an anticlimax. By the time we are finished with this document the people of Australia will be in no doubt about why the coalition has been in opposition for the majority of the past decade and will remain in opposition until it decides to get a leader who has the ability and the nerve to drag its thinking into the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's Fightback document is nothing but a hoax. It does not even attempt to solve the problems which confront us. It is nothing other than a veiled and sinister attempt to undermine just about everything that this Government has worked towards during the past nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hidden agenda which pervades it is the dismantling of the Australian economic and social system as we know it. It aims to replace it with an economy which is driven by greed, which benefits the wealthy and which condemns ordinary Australians to ever-declining relative shares of the national cake. It is nothing other than the tried and failed policies of Thatcher and Reagan. In other words, it is a dog's breakfast scraped from the tables of Thatcher and Reagan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These monetarist policies have resulted in the fiscal blowout and poor trading performance in the United States. The same policies have also led to the severe de-industrialisation and poor trading performance of today's British economy, together with the polarisation of British society into the haves and the have-nots. We do not want that kind of society in Australia. The United Kingdom has a big value added tax and it has a big recession. So why does this magic cure not solve Britain's problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback document is full of naive, glib and downright false statements about the sanctity of uncontrolled markets and how perfect competition can deliver optimal economic, social and ethical outcomes. It could not have been written by anyone who has even the most basic understanding of the workings of modern complex economies. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has some knowledge of economics. He is not knowing about politics and is either not knowing or cynical about how modern real world economies work. We know he knows something of the naive computer simulated models of fictitious idealised economies when he gets out his outdated textbooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document also shows that the Leader of the Opposition is not alone in this regard within the coalition. Given that it is allegedly a team effort, it demonstrates that there is not one person amongst opposition members who have the ability to form even the most basic grasp of how modern real world economies and markets operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the proposals would worsen the problems which our economy faces rather than solving them. I can just take the first example. The document points to inflation as being one of the economy's major ills. I agree that inflation undermines the competitive performance of the economy and redistributes income and wealth from the poor to the rich. It is for this reason that the Government has worked to reduce inflation to the record lows we have achieved today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while we understand the cause of inflation and the need for control, nowhere in the Opposition's document does it even attempt to grapple with the underlying causes of inflation; nor does it show any understanding of how to control inflation. Nowhere does it recognise that a proportion of Australia's inflation is imported because of the openness of the economy. Rather, its solution is to commit monetary policy to a target inflation of nought to 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is done without any recognition of what world inflation may do. This is done with virtually no recognition of what members of the Opposition's own inflation would do and the timing of that on the imposition of a consumption tax if they were to get government. The only way this can be achieved is by severe monetary contraction together with unprecedented high interest rates. That is the only way we could get nought to 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would cause investment to collapse, GDP growth to halt, unemployment to rise further and it would worsen Australia's ability to compete in foreign markets in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any possible gains to families due to the tax cuts would be wiped out by a multiple factor. The document is unethical because it attempts to hide this policy prescription. Nowhere does the document attempt to spell out the consequences of interest rate movements for wiping out the tax cut benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give a second example. The leaders of the Opposition have committed themselves to extremely tight fiscal policies. They have accompanied this with a so-called guarantee that the GST would not rise above 15 per cent. This guarantee is worthless. Who cares if the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party resign? Once the GST was legislated into place, others could and would easily raise the rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international evidence supports this. For example, from a man named Tait of the International Monetary Fund, if we look at the original GST rates and the present rates we see the following: Austria, 8 to 20 per cent; Belgium, 18 to 19 per cent; Denmark, 10 to 22 per cent; France, 13.6 to 18.6 per cent; Germany, 10 to 14 per cent; Ireland, 16.37 to 21 per cent; Israel, 8 to 16 per cent; Italy, 12 to 19 per cent; Luxembourg, 8 to 12 per cent; Madagascar, 12 to 15 per cent; Netherlands, 12 to 18.5 per cent; New Zealand, 10 to 12.5 per cent; Portugal, 16 to 17 per cent; United Kingdom, 10 to 17.5 per cent; and Uruguay, 14 to 22 per cent. The United States does not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim, however, with less direct tax revenues, handing tax powers to the States, tight expenditure plans and an immovable GST rate, the scope and power of fiscal policy would be totally evaporated. All macro-economic management would therefore be forced permanently onto tight monetary policy and high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third example is:  one of the fundamental arguments in the Opposition's election manifesto is that the move to a GST will improve the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and improve trading performance. This is wrong. This argument could not have been made by anyone who has conducted a cursory examination of available knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we talk to Professor Feldstein, a former President of the US Council of Economic Advisers, and Professor Paul Krugman who is one of the foremost authorities on modern trade theory, we find that they have formally demonstrated that a GST will not improve trade performance, and will probably worsen it in the medium to long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a pure GST model with all goods included the effect of international trading performance in an economy with a floating exchange rate like Australia will be zero because the exchange rates will adjust. In a more realistic model in which some goods, such as housing and personal services for example, are exempted, the GST will raise the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables and induce a substitution of these services for tradeable goods. The most likely effect in this case is decline in exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth example is:  the Fightback document shows a complete absence of any awareness of political processes. Many of the policies would result in severe industrial disruption which would negate and prevent any positive outcome. It is simply wrong to advance naive policies without any consideration of the political process through which they may be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the fifth example. The basis for the policy package is a computer simulated model which is entirely incapable of modelling how the economy might respond to the proposals. For example, the scenario C simulation which drives the Fightback package, models the entire gamut of so-called micro-reforms by simply changing upwards a single figure for productivity. This is totally ad hoc and indefensible on three grounds. First, there is no way of telling how much productivity will change, let alone whether it will rise.

But I was interested to note in the Treasurer's address that he listed a long list of countries which have a VAT or GST and, certainly, overseas the rate has changed in those countries. But the truth of the matter is that there are over 50 countries in the world which have gone down the tax reform path of VAT or GST, and further to that 22 out of 24 OECD countries have also gone down that path for very good reason.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will leave any government of which I am a member if the rate is taken above the 15 per cent level. There is a clear cut and absolute commitment in relation to the goods and services tax. In any event, I say to the people across Australia that the rate will be set in concrete in legislation.

We have the funds to proceed down that path responsibly because of the way the GST package has been constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also made the big mistake of referring to Queensland and its Public Service. I am informed reliably by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the honourable member for Wide Bay, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and others that there have been some very ugly things going on in the Public Service in Queensland since the election of the Goss Government. Let us begin with the Treasurer, who is the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He sent all of his double dry deregulators up into the office of the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, and ran a series of Kerin-type agendas out of that office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, we now know that massive sackings are going on in the Queensland Public Service; we now know that there are massive transfers; we now know that some appalling things are happening to what was once a very proud and neutral Public Service going about its good work, as it should, in relation to the Government of Queensland. In earlier times in Queensland we had a State government where the books actually stacked up in terms of financial resources, which was streets ahead of the Victorian or South Australian situation. Even the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) admits that that is the financial circumstance in respect of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the matter of Queensland has been raised here tonight by the Treasurer, let me quote the notice of motion given by the Leader of the National Party, Russell Cooper, in the Queensland Parliament this day:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Welcomes and endorses the positive and wide-ranging package of tax reform measures outlined by the Federal coalition, including major State benefits such as the abolition of payroll tax and wiping of fuel excise costs and condemns the negative attitude of the Premier for his short sighted criticism of such measures as compared with the more measured response of the Victorian Premier who attacked `carping critics' who had not looked at the overall reform package.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the notice of motion given in the Queensland Parliament today. I could do no better than read to this House of Representatives the opening comments of the Queensland Leader of the Opposition in giving that notice of motion. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Australia were offered not a grab-bag of election promises, but the most carefully balanced, meticulously engineered, economic reform package this nation has ever seen.</PARA>

<PARA>I say amen to that. That is a correct analysis of the situation and the overwhelmingly good response to this Fightback package which has given people hope in the depth of the recession right across Australia. That has been the circuit breaker response which has brought people out to meetings and functions and put spirit into their contributions to those functions because they want a better way. They want the abolition of seven separate taxes; they want the reduction of three other major taxes; they accept that for once we have a Leader of the Opposition who has charted a course by providing a comprehensive policy package which can stand up to the analysis of this Labor Government and deliver an economic U-turn to Australia before it is too late. </PARA>

It is clear from that executive summary and the comments which those opposite have made that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> front page banner of last Friday got it right. In big, bold letters, it said `Bonanza for the rich'. That is what the package is about. There is a very deep and wide philosophical difference between the views expressed in the package put together by the Opposition and announced last week and the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's package is underpinned, I think, by four main characteristics. Clearly, the goods and services tax replacing wholesale sales tax is one of them; next is the $10 billion reduction in Federal Government outlays; the third is a 5 per cent cut in funding to the States; and the fourth&mdash;although it does not receive nearly the same prominence, other than from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;is the deregulated labour market that those opposite intend to introduce. Let us get that straight for the moment, because the words `deregulated labour market' are the jargon or code words which, in reality and practice, mean no unions, no arbitration commission, no umpire, no bargaining rights, no conditions and worse salaries. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax versus the goods and services tax debate is, in many ways, the central focus of what we have been witnessing in the last five days. A lot of misinformation has been peddled about that, and there has been a lot of very simplistic reporting, I might say. There has been the assumption that a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent, for example, results in goods being more expensive than they would be with a goods and services tax of 15 per cent. That is simply not the case in many situations. I will give a couple of simple examples. If we take an item that retails for $10, it is not uncommon for that article to wholesale at about $6. That $6 wholesale price currently attracts, on some items, a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent. That is $1.20 in taxation. If we take that $1.20 away from the $10 retail price, we are left with the sum of $8.80 as the tax free cost of that item. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult for some honourable members opposite to follow the figures without the bouncing ball, but I urge them to tax their intellect and follow the logic. The totally tax free $8.80 article would, under the Opposition's proposals, attract a 15 per cent GST, which just happens to be $1.32, or 12c more than the $1.20. It costs more with the GST than with wholesale sales tax. That is a mythical example of an article that costs $10, but it is a pretty accurate assessment. That point has not been lost on some of the accounting firms and some of the financial commentators. Indeed, the indirect taxes manager of KPMG Peat Marwick, Mr Robert Olding, was reported last week as saying that items presently sales taxed at 20 per cent or 30 per cent would not necessarily fall in price. The article said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was because sales tax was levied on the retailer's purchase price, whereas the goods and services tax would be levied on the retailer's selling price, which is higher than the purchase price due to retail mark-up.</PARA>
<PARA>That was printed in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on the 22nd of this month, and the article goes into some other examples. It is quite clear that the purported savings for consumers are largely illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to some interesting comments that have been made <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>about the vehicle industry, because much play has been made about the savings that ordinary Australians would derive from replacing the wholesale sales tax with the goods and services tax. Let us see who gets the savings. This will reinforce the view that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> had it right when it said that it was about privilege and benefit to the rich. Let us take a Ford Falcon, a standard vehicle that many people would seek to purchase. A Ford Falcon now costs $24,608. With a GST in the place of the wholesale sales tax, it would cost $24,502, which is a total difference of $106. A Mazda 323, a small four-cylinder car, currently costs $18,615. One would save $75 on that. On the purchase of a vehicle, a saving of $75 or $100 would not be the be-all and end-all in a person's considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, we look at the sorts of vehicles that the rich purchase, we get a very different story. Under our system, or our tax regime, those highly priced vehicles attract a higher rate of tax. If we look at those more expensive vehicles under the Opposition's GST we find a very different story. Let us take a 300E Mercedes-Benz, which currently retails at $102,500. A person who bought one of those would save $6,800, which is a substantial difference. If you went to a Porsche 911, you would save $11,000. And, just as a matter of interest, if you bought a Ferrari, you would in fact save $15,000. The people who gain out of the swapping of the wholesale sales tax for a goods and services tax are not the ordinary people in the street; they are those who are now well paid and in the more privileged positions within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I have mentioned new vehicles. It is worth noting that the situation is very different for second-hand vehicles. I might remind those on the opposite side of the House that many Australian families in fact do not go to the local showroom to buy a brand new Commodore or Falcon, much less a Porsche or Ferrari; they buy the modest second-hand vehicle, which currently attracts no wholesale sales tax whatsoever&mdash;none. Honourable members opposite would impose a goods and services tax on the ordinary family person who purchases a second-hand vehicle, and they would give a significant financial benefit to the rich in this community who do not buy the Commodores, Falcons or Mazdas off the showroom floor but who buy the Mercedes-Benz, the Porsches and the Ferraris. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting also that the Opposition, as part of the package it has put forward, has once again set out the view that we should have zero tariffs&mdash;zero protection for all industry by the year 2000. I will not go into detail on that matter because time does not permit that, but it is worth referring the House, once again, to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article of 18 June this year which featured the Liberal Party's policy on these matters following an interview with Mr Ian McLachlan, the shadow spokesperson on industry and commerce. That article had the headline, `Libs pull the wheels off the car plan'. The vehicle industry was concerned in June of this year when it heard from the shadow spokesman what the Opposition's plan was for manufacturing in this industry. The industry will be horrified at some of the aspects of the package that the Opposition has now put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with those questions of wholesale sales tax, I should also note that there is a great range of products which all people in this land purchase on a weekly basis when they go to the supermarket and which are not taxed at all. Of course, they are the basic items: bread, fruit, milk, eggs and clothes&mdash;the necessities of life, which this Government recognises should not be taxed. Honourable members opposite would impose a regressive and harsh tax upon the people of Australia, requiring each of those items to increase in price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should not let the opportunity pass without making some comment about the heartless, destructive and divisive policies that permeate the Opposition's package. A $10 billion cut in Federal Government outlays is the most savage reduction, from an already low base, that this country would ever see. Federal Government outlays as a percentage of GDP are already at levels of 25 years ago. The fact of life is that this Government has progressively reduced the Government's slice of the national cake. From that low base, the Opposition intends to take $10 billion. Coupled with the cuts in funding to the States, the net result can only be a diminution and reduction of the services in hospitals, schools, police forces, and of the infrastructure for water, electricity and the like. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1991 is bad legislation. The Opposition will vote against it. The proposals contained in this Bill are an attack on the way legal rights have been traditionally exercised under our system of law. Under our system of law, individual rights are exercised by individual choice. Individual rights are exercised on behalf of individuals who choose to take their claims to court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, under the proposals in this Bill individual rights will be exercised on behalf of individuals thrown into classes at the choice of people who decide to initiate class actions. The Bill is flawed because it is an attack on the way legal rights are traditionally exercised in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill is a step on the way to making Australia a more litigious society. It will encourage the proliferation of litigation in this country and it will encourage the proliferation of lawsuits in this country, and that is not in the interests of the public in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Bill is flawed because it will change the nature of legal practice. Hitherto, lawyers have provided services to those wanting to exercise their legal rights, who consult them and ask those lawyers to act on their behalf. This will change with the introduction of the alterations proposed in this Bill. Lawyers will be encouraged to commence entrepreneurial practice, to find people to initiate class actions, and to litigate those actions through individuals on behalf of classes. Lawyers will have an incentive to spruik for actions on behalf of people who do not know the action is being brought, who have not consulted the lawyer to bring the action, and who may not even want the action to be brought on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, this is flawed legislation because no grounds have been shown which will justify the changes introduced by this Bill. If the object is to reduce the costs of litigation, the proposals in this Bill are a wholly unnecessary overreaction. There is no correspondence between the problem of the costs of litigation and the solution mooted in this Bill. It is like having open-heart surgery to treat a headache. It is an unnecessary overreaction. During the committee stage of this Bill, the Opposition will move amendments which provide a workable and sensible solution, which provide proportionate surgery for the malady which is to be cured, and which meet the real problems of the costs of litigation without the detrimental effects inherent in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly outline what this Bill does. It proposes to insert a new part IVA into the Federal Court of Australia Act. It will enable the bringing of class actions in the court. The Federal Court rules currently make provision for numerous persons with the same interest to bring an action in the name of one person representing the others. There is current provision in the Federal Court rules to bring representative proceedings. Recently this was done in a case in which His Honour Mr Justice Wilcox was presiding, where 116 people were allowed to group their claim into one proceeding and have it proceed under the current rules in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Bill proposes to introduce a new part. Under the proposed section 33C, seven or more persons may have an action commenced on their behalf by a representative party where the claims are in respect of or arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and where the claims give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. The proceeding may be commenced whether or not it is concerned with separate contracts or transactions, or involves separate acts or omissions. The consent of a person to be grouped into the class is not required. A representative party can start an action on behalf of a class without the person's consent, if that person is a member of the class&mdash;except where the person is the Commonwealth, a Minister, a body corporate established for a public purpose, or an officer of the Commonwealth or a State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representative proceedings may not be commenced if the proceedings would be concerned only with claims where the Federal Court has jurisdiction solely by reason of cross-vesting. But since the Federal Court has an associated jurisdiction, this Bill will open the procedure to claims which primarily relate to State law where there is an associated Federal element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new part is supposed to apply only to causes of action arising after the commencement of this legislation. But this does not mean it will apply only to transactions occurring after the commencement of the Act. Suppose, for example, a claim for product liability is made. Even if the product has already been sold, if the loss arises after the commencement of the Act the cause of action would accrue after commencement and the procedure would be open in respect of that particular claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group member may opt out of a representative proceeding or class action by written notice given under the rules of the court. Notice must be given to group members of the commencement of the proceeding. The court may not order the notice to be given personally to each group member unless it is satisfied that it is reasonably practicable and not unduly expensive to do so. It is plainly intended that notice of proceedings be given by press advertisement or radio or television broadcast. That means that somebody can commence an action, and the court will order that notice through press advertisement or radio broadcasting be given that it has commenced. Unless members of the class give notice to the court and opt out of that proceeding, their rights will be litigated as part of that action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court can order that the representative proceeding not continue where it concludes that if judgment were given in favour of the action the cost of identifying group members and distributing to them would be excessive. The court can order a representative proceeding not continue if costs are likely to exceed the cost of individual separate proceedings. The plain intention is that individuals' rights be bound up in a class action and determined as a class. Where the court determines to award damages, it can do so in a way that the entitlement of each member is worked out in relation to directions to be given by the court. The court can set up a fund to hold moneys to be distributed, and the costs of administering the fund are borne by the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No rules as to the award of costs in representative proceedings are introduced, except as provided in section 33ZJ. It is assumed, therefore, that costs will follow the ordinary rules. If the person bringing the action on behalf of the class loses the action, that person would be liable. If the person wins, that person will be entitled to costs. But there is no provision in the Act for the person who is the representative party and who may be liable under an award of costs to get a contribution from the members of the class. This means that if a respondent wins an action and gets an award of costs and the representative party is impecunious&mdash;even though there might be a lot of assets held by the class collectively&mdash;there will be no access to those particular costs. Indeed, there is no provision in this Bill for the awarding of security for costs in respect of a representative party bringing the action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, even as it is drawn, leaves many unanswered questions. It does have an element of retrospectivity, allowing claims to be brought under this procedure where transactions giving rise to the claim have already occurred&mdash;such as the purchase of a product, as I have already outlined&mdash;if the loss occurs after the commencement of the Bill. If the loss occurs after the commencement of the Bill, the representative party could bring the action, and bring it on behalf of all the class that was in that particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So notwithstanding the assurances that have been given by the responsible Minister in the other place, Senator Tate, it does have an element of retrospectivity. Also, it does not make clear how costs are to be apportioned amongst group members for unsuccessful claims. As I have already outlined, it is to be assumed that costs will fall on the representative party. This means that if one is going to bring a class action, one would be wise to choose an impecunious representative party. If the claim should fail and an award of costs is made against the applicant, the applicant will have no assets from which to pay the costs. This will also lead to the practice of `greenmail', whereby actions are commenced against respondents and the respondents know that the costs of defending the action are so high that it is commercial commonsense to pay out the claim rather than have it effectively litigated, particularly when there is no guarantee that, even if an award of costs is made, costs will be recoverable from the representative party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also alters the normal rules in relation to the limitation of actions. The limitation period ceases whilst a person is a member of a class and the class action is proceeding. When that person takes himself out of the class the limitation period starts to run again. It is feasible that a person could be a member of a class for six or seven years whilst the action was proceeding, pull himself out and effectively commence his own action which would be outside the normal limitation period but inside the limitation period as altered by the proposals in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is also defective because it makes no provision for cross claims. It does not explain how cross claims will be brought against individual members of the class. It is obviously going to be very difficult to have cross claims against the representative party when the transactions, the facts and the circumstances could be very different in relation to each individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those defects, even on the face of the Government's own Bill, prove that this has not been well thought out. It is not a comprehensive code. It is not something that will give certainty to the way in which proceedings will go ahead in the Federal Court if this Bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside all the defects in the way the Government has put forward its own proposal or its own model, the proposal is fundamentally flawed. As I said earlier, firstly, it is an attack on the way legal rights have been traditionally exercised under our system of law. Under our system of law a person who is aggrieved has the right to approach the court at his choice and to have that grievance heard. He decides whether to lodge a claim. He does not have his claim lodged by someone else without his consent and without his knowledge. This will become possible under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless a person tells the court that he does not want his claim litigated, he will have his claim litigated as part of a class whether he likes it or not and whether he knows about it or not and his individual rights will be subsumed into the rights of the class. If the action is mucked up and if the action loses, he will have no right to come back and have his individual claim heard at his option by his lawyer presenting his evidence as he sees fit. Rights can be extinguished without the knowledge of a person who is a member of a class. They can be extinguished unless that person knows and opts out of the particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia recently put out a press release. It has sought and received comments from leading firms of solicitors in relation to this particular proposal. Mr Wilson, from the firm Clayton Utz, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who fails to have the capacity to take a positive step to opt out of a representative action will automatically become a member of the class and will thereby become bound by the decision in the representative action. If the plaintiffs obtain a favourable result there may be no prejudice but if the plaintiffs fail it means that a person who has taken no positive step in either identifying himself or putting forward his claim will be bound by the adverse decision of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This appears to us to be neither equitable nor efficient.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Bob Baxt, from the firm Arthur Robinson and Hedderwicks, said much the same thing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opt out system is another example of increasing interference with the individual rights of citizens. They should not be joined or named in a particular proceeding unless they provide their consent. Whilst they may not be named in the proceedings, it is possible that they will be named (without their knowledge), thus impinging on their right to privacy. In a democratic society citizens should be able to choose whether they want to be involved in particular litigation or proceedings. They should not have to go to court to assert this fundamental right.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments which the Opposition will move during the committee stage reinforce the traditional rights of the individual in relation to litigation. They will provide a mechanism which will save costs and provide economies of scale, but preserve individual rights. One can choose to have one's rights litigated rather than have them litigated by somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I said that this Bill is a step on the way to making Australia a more litigious society. For many there is a belief that life's problems can all be solved by legal actions, that there is compensation out there for wrongs and if we can only find the defendant and find the class, all of life's problems will go away. This Bill re-emphasises and underlines that basic wrong belief about the way in which society works. It says that any person who can be slotted into a class, and a defendant conveniently found, can be given compensation. This Bill provides a mechanism by which that fundamentally wrong view of the way in which society works can be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that some of the support for this move comes from the organised consumer movement. Honourable members should not believe that the promotion of a litigious society is in the best interests of consumers. It is in the interests of lawyers&mdash;the Labor Party loves lawyers; it keeps on introducing more mechanisms by which lawyers can make money&mdash;but honourable members should not believe for a moment that it is in the interests of consumers. Higher risks of litigation on a wider scale mean higher premiums, higher costs and higher prices. That is not in the interests of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes people confuse anti-business legislation as being pro-consumer legislation. That is not necessarily the case. This is a classic piece of legislation which Senator Peter Walsh would describe as new class legislation designed to provide income for the new class, including lawyers, who will profit greatly out of this. But honourable members should not believe that it will help consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has come in Australia where we ought to be encouraging business, not increasing opportunities for organised litigation against it. Make no mistake about it, this Bill has the potential to encourage litigation. It will encourage widespread organised litigation on behalf of classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that honourable members read the book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Litigation Explosion</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">&mdash;What Happened when America Unleashed the Lawsuit</EMPHASIS>. America unleashed the lawsuit primarily through class actions. There are additional features of the American system that help organised litigation, such as the costs rule and contingency fees, but the first breakthrough in relation to organised litigation in the United States was in relation to class actions. Let me tell honourable members how it works. The book states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the brouhaha over the liaison between evangelist Jim Bakker and church secretary Jessica Hahn, lawyers filed suit against the Bakker ministry on behalf of three members of an Ohio family who had given the ministry $11,800.</PARA>
<PARA>They also filed on behalf of the whole class of donors. The lawyers asked for $100m in compensatory damages for the whole class and $500m in punitive damages. That gives us an idea that when a client goes to a lawyer with a claim, the lawyer will not just issue the proceeding on that client's behalf, he will issue the proceeding on behalf of the whole class that that client can be part of and he can escalate the damages in the claim and escalate the fees. Let me give honourable members another example of how it works in the United States. The book goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After a 1987 Northwest crash in Detroit, one enterprising runner reportedly dressed as a priest to mingle among grieving families. Others posed as Red Cross workers after a store roof collapsed in south Texas, helping dig out victims and sign them up.</PARA>
<PARA>This will promote a more litigious society. Any lawyer who finds a client who has a claim would be mad just to issue the claim on behalf of that client. What he will do now is issue the claim on behalf of the class that that client falls into. This is why I said, thirdly, that the Bill changes the nature of legal practice. A lawyer will no longer be acting for a client he knows who wants him to act on his or her behalf, he can turn the suit into a class action and act on behalf of the class as long as he can find somebody who has a valid claim. This point is also made by some of the country's leading solicitors. Mr Salgo from Baker and McKenzie stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view the existence of an opt out procedure will often lead to the institution of law suits, nominally on behalf of a large class composed of unidentified individuals, but which might in reality be conducted for the benefit of a small group of lawyers and their associates, substantially motivated by self interest. Such proceedings would be driven by those running them as opposed to the client group. We believe that this fairly summarises the United States experience with opt out procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it will work. If a lawyer finds a client who has suffered injuries from a damaged toaster, he does not sue on behalf of that client, he will sue on behalf of all purchasers of that particular toaster. Of course, if a lawyer finds a person who has bought a damaged toaster and another lawyer finds another person who has bought a damaged toaster, each can commence a class action on behalf of all toaster buyers and the court, presumably, will have to decide which one of the actions goes forward as a class action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, the court will decide which group of lawyers will get the proceeds of running the class action. We will have entrepreneurial lawyers finding plaintiffs, turning them into class actions and basically fighting over the pickings. My press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Class actions will also facilitate the emergence of entrepreneurial lawyers more interested in getting control of litigation on behalf of large classes than in representing individual clients. Such lawyers would spruik for legal actions. Different firms will chase individuals to initiate class actions so that the firms get control of the legal proceedings and the fees they will generate. The Court will be faced with having to choose between different class representatives being put forward in the knowledge they are being forced to decide which lawyers will take the fruits of handling the action.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how there will be conflicts of interest. As lawyers fight over who gets the right to represent the class, they will be fighting over who gets the right to run the action and who gets the right to make the money. The primary interest of the lawyers will be to control the litigation rather than to service their clients. This is another factor which will prompt the explosion in litigation as a result of these wholly unnecessary amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government really wanted to promote economies of scale and avoid a multiplicity of separate actions, those people who wanted to join an action could be given the right to opt in to that action. They could go down to the court or write to the court and say that they wanted part of the action and wanted to have their individual rights litigated in the action and to individually choose to exercise their rights, rather than have those rights exercised for them as part of a class action by failing to opt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government really wanted to take advantage of those economies of scale it could vote for our amendments. Our amendments would harmonise the Federal Court procedure with the procedures in State courts, and particularly with the procedure which has recently been adopted in the Supreme Court of Victoria, which is essentially an opt-in system&mdash;a system which is consonant with the traditional exercise of individual rights and the way our legal system operates; a system which is not an unnecessary inducement or incitement to litigation; a system which will not encourage the emergence of entrepreneurial lawyers looking out for their own actions, putting them into a conflict of interest situation; and a system which would promote an outcome which would ameliorate the costs of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should have allowed proper time for the consideration of this proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to support the Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1991, which I believe is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament by this Government. This legislation seeks to redress the imbalance in the court system, in the legal system, between the people who are wealthy and powerful and those who are less wealthy and less powerful&mdash;the poor, the ordinary people of this country. That is the basic intention of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It arises from the 1988 report of the Law Reform Commission, which the Commission produced following a reference by Attorney-General Ellicott in 1977. The point I want to draw from that is that that is an indication to people of how much time and effort went into the careful preparation of the report of the Law Reform Commission which finally led to this legislation. For anybody to say, as the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) did just before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, that this legislation has been rushed into the Parliament and that the Government is in some haste to get it through indicates that that person is not taking the matter seriously. This matter was first put before the Law Reform Commission in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested in this matter because it is of concern to anybody who believes in equity and a fair go in our society, and that ordinary people should be able to get remedies in the courts. Whilst people can say, rather facetiously, that any individual who has a right can exercise that right, we know that that is not the reality;  the reality is that ordinary people, as consumers or injured workers, for example, are not able to exercise their rights in the courts as more well-to-do people are able to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to enable those people who have a common cause of action to club together so that they are able to have a matter litigated and, hopefully, result in a satisfactory outcome. I have noticed from reading some of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reports on this matter that there have not been very clear examples of what the legislation is trying to achieve. I thought I would give an example that came to my attention some years ago. At that time a company that produced car tyres in this country had produced a large number of faulty tyres. The fault was that the tyres were not matured properly, I think was the term. The result was that people who bought them new would not notice that there was anything wrong with them, but they would get only 15,000 kilometres from the tyres before they were worn out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after a large number of complaints that the company finally started to agree that there might have been something wrong with the product and replaced the tyres. However, thousands of people who had bought the tyres never became aware that there was anything wrong with them;  they simply thought the tyres had worn out pretty quickly and replaced them, purchasing new tyres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had a so-called class action been available, an action could have been taken on behalf of all of those people and the company could have been sued. Even though each individual person might have had a claim for only $30 or $40, the company would have had to notify the names of those who had purchased those tyres and it would have been possible for the plaintiff to get onto all of those people and to draw them into the action so that they would have been able to get redress and proper compensation for the loss that they suffered. That is the way in which this legislation will work in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say that the Law Reform Commission did an excellent job in preparing its forty-sixth report. It is an exceptionally good report. It is a scholarly report. I congratulate all the people who worked on it&mdash;there were a large number of people and I will not name them now&mdash;and who did a thoroughly good job. I also want to congratulate the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate)  on  bringing  the  legislation  forward. It  was obvious  that  it  would  draw  some</PARA>
<PARA>controversy, as it has. However, he was prepared to pick up the ball and run with it. I congratulate him on that. In years to come when ordinary people are benefiting from this legislation, they might not go to Senator Tate and say, `Thank you very much',  but he will know that it was his legislation which led to a fairer go for thousands and thousands of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins had a lot to say in condemning this legislation and trying to draw comparisons with the legislation that exists in the United States for class actions. That is a completely fallacious comparison. There is one significant difference between the class action proposal in this legislation and the legislation which exists in the United States. That is to do with the way in which lawyers in the United States go about their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are arrangements in the US by which lawyers can charge on an ad valorem scale, or charge so-called contingency fees, so that a lawyer can enter a contract with individual plaintiffs to take one-third of the proceeds for damages of a successful claim. We do not have that arrangement in Australia, so there is nothing like that sort of inducement to lawyers to actually seek clients and take actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the scares referred to by the honourable member for Higgins are wholly unfounded in the Australian context. I think it was quite unfair of him to raise the matter in the way in which he did, because in Australia we simply are not going to see a rush to law as a result of this legislation. On the contrary, this legislation may turn out to be part of the micro-economic reform strategy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from some examples of the extraordinarily inefficient proceedings that have been taken in the courts in the past that this legislation may lead to greater efficiency. For example, more than 300 workers were afflicted with asbestos related disease as a result of working for a CSR subsidiary, Midalco, in Western Australia. The result was that 300 people took actions in the courts, claiming damages. If this legislation had been in place, all of them may have been able to take one simple action; in doing that, there would have been one court case&mdash;possibly a more complex case than the 300 individual cases, but the amount of court time would have been divided by almost 300. I think that is a great example of why we need this legislation and why as a Parliament we should adopt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a great pity that the Liberal Opposition has chosen to oppose this legislation. That shows how far it has moved towards the extreme right in the past decade or so. I remind the House that it was Attorney-General Ellicott in the Fraser Government who referred these matters to the Law Reform Commission; a Liberal Attorney-General wanted to see law reform on the issue of class action. The Law Reform Commission laboured hard and produced its report. What do we find? As I see it, the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, has not picked up the whole of the report, only the essentials of it. Even then, the Liberals are opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has opposed the legislation. Why? Anyone who listened, as I did, to the contribution from the honourable member for Higgins could get some idea of why the Opposition would be opposing it. The honourable member spent most of his speech quoting and requoting from the Business Council of Australia's press release which was put out with a series of quotes from Mr Hugh Morgan. It is interesting to look through that press release and deal with some of the comments that were made. Strangely, all of the law firms that were quoted as having concerns about and opposition to this legislation were the big corporate law firms of the nation. That is hardly surprising, because their clients&mdash;the big firms, manufacturers and the like&mdash;are the ones who put unsafe products onto the market in Australia from time to time, the ones who are involved in unsafe work practices, and who undertake various other activities which lay them open to action in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past these wrongdoers have often got away with doing that because it has been almost impossible for the man in the street to sue huge corporations. The honourable member for Higgins said that this legislation will lead to increases in costs. I say that, if these firms are acting wrongly, they ought to be brought to book. The way to do that is to ensure that they can be properly taken before the appropriate court and dealt with. This legislation will enable that to happen, at least in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note Clayton Utz's comment in the press release from the Business Council of Australia that clause 332(4) would lead to injustice. That clause does not mean what Clayton Utz says it does. It enables the court to give directions in those cases, but not all cases, where individual group members need to show that they belong to a group. I see nothing wrong with putting the power to do that into the hands of the Federal Court. Saying that should not happen is really an expression of a lack of confidence in the Federal Court. Baker and McKenzie made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view the existence of an opt out procedure will often lead to the institution of law suits, nominally on behalf of a large class composed of unidentified individuals, but which might in reality be conducted for the benefit of a small group of lawyers and their associates, substantially motivated by self interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Coming from an organisation such as Baker and McKenzie, I think that comment must almost be tongue in cheek. However, it is fair to say that that comment might be true in some US class actions, for the reasons that I have referred to earlier about contingency fees. But this Bill does not introduce the US system, and I would not support the introduction of the US system. No contingency fees or other cost incentives for lawyers are contained in this Bill, so this comment has no relevance to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said a moment ago that this law will apply only to the Federal Court of Australia. I think that is inevitable, but I think it is a sad commentary that the law will not apply at this stage to the cross-vesting jurisdiction of the Federal Court. I hope that in the future the Government will look at an amendment to the Bill&mdash;or the Act, as I hope it will be&mdash;which will allow the cross-vesting jurisdiction to be taken into account for this Act, particularly in relation to States where the supreme courts already have a class action procedure, such as South Australia. There seems to me to be no reason why South Australia should not have its cross-vesting jurisdiction included in this legislation; likewise with the Victorians and any other State that chooses to pick up this type of legislation and run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel drafted this legislation, but I want to compliment them. I hope that this Bill indicates a new style of drafting at the Commonwealth level. It is clean and understandable, and a reasonably intelligent lay person would be able to read this Bill and understand what it is about. I think that is an enormous advance on the sort of drafting that we so often get at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made this point before and will make it again: it is strange that the High Court manages to interpret the legislation from South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland, where the style is quite simple, and, on the other hand, manages to interpret the legislation from New South Wales and the Commonwealth, which is of much greater complexity. If the High Court can do that, I cannot see the reason for the continuation of the complex type of drafting that we so often see in this place. The Commonwealth drafting people should concentrate on placing more emphasis on plain English and explanations in legislation which are readily interpretable by, as I have said, intelligent lay people. That would be very useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as I am out of time, I support the legislation; I think it is long overdue. I will be delighted to see it become law, and I congratulate the Minister for Justice on bringing it in. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Commission ultimately, 11 years later&mdash;in 1988&mdash;favoured the grouped proceedings and the implementation of a procedure by which individuals could be included in a group for the purposes of litigation, under the opt-out legislation the choice between opting into a suit and opting out of a suit was in contention throughout the inquiry, and it is still a matter of contention even today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be reiterated that the coalition is not opposed to the concept of grouped proceedings but it does have objections to the opt-out model which has been favoured by the Government. We believe that an opt-in model, whereby a proposal to bring a legal action on behalf of a group and not just an individual may be advertised and individuals invited to join in those proceedings, is preferable to the system which is contemplated in this Bill. It is true that the opt-out model has been favoured in the United States of America in various jurisdictions but, equally, it has been rejected in the European court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not repeat the arguments which have been advanced by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) against the opt-out system and in favour of the opt-in alternatives, but I do wish to address a few remarks to a number of practical consequences of this legislation. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, said in a media release dated 17 April 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will confer no new legal rights&mdash;but it will allow people to assert existing rights collectively, effectively and more cheaply. If such a measure had already been in operation, the present actions by haemophiliacs and others who have medically acquired AIDS, for example, could have proceeded with one action representing the general group of AIDS sufferers.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also interesting to note, in the light of the reported comments of Senator Tate, the comments of Mr Peter Gordon, a solicitor representing sufferers of medically acquired AIDS, that this legislation would not assist those suffering from the condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) has made some derogatory comments about legal firms that have offered their professional opinion about this legislation, suggesting that they were from a conservative mould. May I remind the honourable member for Makin that the firm from which Mr Peter Gordon comes, namely Slater and Gordon in Melbourne, is well known as a labour firm and not one which has been traditionally associated with representing employers. Mr Gordon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proponents of class actions need to understand that there are tremendous liability differences across a class of victims. If the first case for medically acquired HIV brought in Australia had been the representative case everyone would have lost.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gordon said that the class actions do not achieve justice in AIDS actions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because if you simply try to assign the result in one case to every case that would be unjust. On the other hand, if you tried within the scope of one class action to solve every single legal issue it would be an impossible job and it would probably cost more in legal costs than running all of the claims individually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Gordon went on to say that it would be of assistance to HIV sufferers if the Federal Government stopped trying to get the States not to deal with AIDS sufferers for compensation. In fact, a survey of the States in these cases shows that, given the alleged objective of this Bill to assist groups ranging from small shareholders and investors to people pursuing medical or consumer claims, there is rampant hypocrisy on the part of the Government. For example, the current Government has done nothing to assist the speedy resolution of the claims of those persons suffering from AIDS as a result of alleged medical negligence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are approximately 200 people around Australia with medically acquired AIDS. Only in Western Australia has the Government been prepared to settle these actions. In other States we have the spectre of long, costly trials. AIDS is not the only grim reaper; the Federal Government, in denying the claims of AIDS sufferers with medically acquired AIDS, is itself in these instances also a grim reaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the most recent trial in Victoria it has been estimated that the State's legal costs alone in an 87-day trial were some $10m. Yet I am informed that many if not all these cases could be settled and that the State governments not only in Victoria but in other States of Australia are willing to settle them. Why then, in the face of this legislation which has the aim of improving access to the legal system and presumably the delivery of justice, is the Federal Government blocking the settlement of these cases? For $10m in legal fees&mdash;that is the cost of the legal fees in just one case&mdash;20 of these cases could probably be settled. The financial savings to the Commonwealth and the States would be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the only reason that has been advanced against settlement of the cases involving AIDS sufferers is that the AIDS sufferers should not be differentiated because of the cause of their disease. The consequence is that those who acquired the disease medically through the provable negligence of public institutions and government instrumentalities are being denied compensation simply because some Ministers in this Government do not wish to offend interest groups concerned with the protection of people who have acquired the disease by sexual transmission and who are overwhelmingly, in this country, homosexual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of innocence or guilt. These people received a terminal disease directly from a government instrumentality or an organisation directly funded by government and, therefore, there is some responsibility towards them in relation to their sickness and the care of their health condition. What we are talking about is dealing with institutions which, once the nature of the threat of AIDS was known, exposed patients unnecessarily to risk through blood products that had not been screened and did not warn those patients of the danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. G.G.D. Scholes)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Mr Deputy Speaker says, but it does indicate once again, I would suggest, the hypocrisy of a government. It says on one hand, `Let us have greater access to justice'. On the other hand, the settlement of 200 cases around Australia where access to justice could be determined quite quickly by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is, on the information that has been provided by Labor lawyers&mdash;not conservative lawyers&mdash;being held up. That is a blatant case of hypocrisy on the part of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to something more apposite to the Bill itself, namely, the matter of costs. The matter of costs has been raised by the honourable member for Higgins in his contribution to the debate about this Bill. It is worth noting that the Law Reform Commission in the model draft Act which was appended to its report included the following proposition as section 31, subsection (1):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this Act, the court may not order a group member to pay the costs of the respondent in the group members proceeding (except to the extent that the group member has the conduct of proceedings) but such an order may be made against the principal applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (2) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a group members proceeding, an order for security for costs may not be made against the principal applicant on the ground that the proceeding is for the benefit of the group member and not for the benefit of the principal applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>In the draft explanatory memorandum set out in the Law Reform Commission's report No. 46 of 1988, the Commission indicated that proposed section 31(1) would relieve the group members from liability to pay the costs on the part of any other party and impose that liability on the principal applicant. The ordinary liability for costs would apply, however, to the extent that the group member was conducting his or her own proceeding. In paragraph 261 of the report the Law Reform Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal applicant should be liable for any costs ordered to be paid in group members proceedings of which she or he has had the conduct. Group members should not be liable to pay the costs of another party except to the extent that they have assumed the conduct of their own proceedings. This should not preclude a principal applicant from contracting with identified group members for a pro rata indemnity for any costs ordered to be paid by the principal applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Makin congratulated parliamentary counsel on the way in which this Bill has been drafted with such clarity. Let me raise, for the consideration of the House, a matter that exhibits something less than clarity. If one looks to the costs proceedings in this Bill, to which the honourable member for Higgins has pointed, there are at least two interpretations of the way in which costs may be applied. The first interpretation, which has been outlined by the honourable member for Higgins, is that, because there is no direct reference to costs in this Bill, the only person as a losing applicant, if I can put it that way, who may be able to have costs awarded against him or her is that representative party, himself or herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Higgins pointed out, if that party is impecunious, it could lead to a situation where, if `greenmail', for example, had been used by an environmental group against some manufacturer to make a claim which was totally spurious, and proven by a court of law to be totally spurious, then when that manufacturer, for example, sought to recover costs from the applicant, the manufacturer was faced with the situation of only being able to recover costs against the representative party. If that party is impecunious, obviously costs cannot be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, one can read this Bill as saying that because there is no direct reference to costs in the Bill, and because the court is able to order costs against the losing party, in fact a court could order costs against the losing party&mdash;namely, all the members of that group that is represented by the representative party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling lack of clarity in a Bill before the Federal Parliament. If that interpretation is correct, we have a situation where members of a party&mdash;who may be members of the party before the court unbeknown to them, because we have a situation where parties are deemed to be parties unless they opt out&mdash;not knowing that they are involved in an action, could find themselves the subjects of an order for costs against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in this Bill which clearly spells out what the situation should be in relation to legal costs, other than saying that the court may make any other orders which it deems to be appropriate. I would have thought, in respect of the comments made by the honourable member for Makin, that if this were a Bill in which clarity had been expressed by parliamentary counsel, we would see a situation where the costs could be awarded either in favour of the respondent, the party who has been sued, or against the applicants, namely, all those members who may not even know that they are members of a group to a legal action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the very sort of point we will find litigated before the High Court in this country one day because this Parliament has failed to spell out clearly what the situation is. Whether the interpretation which has been posited by the honourable member for Higgins or the alternative interpretation which I have posited is correct is really beyond the point of this debate. The real point of this debate is that if parliamentary counsel had been up to their duty, and if the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) had been up to his responsibility in this matter, then the question of costs in relation to these sorts of actions would have clearly been posited so that there will not be a situation where we may find we may have an appeal to a supreme court, to the full court of a supreme court and, ultimately, to the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government says that it wants to bring down legal costs; this legislation ought to be thrown up time and time again as an example of legislation which will do just the opposite. That question of costs ought to be addressed. I know this legislation has passed through the Senate, and the Government has the numbers in this House so it may force it through here. But amendments which will clarify the situation in relation to costs and the responsibility of individuals ought to be introduced at this point and not left to litigation before the courts which will cost parties more money in these sorts of actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other difficulties with this legislation have already been raised by the honourable member for Higgins. These are difficulties which have been clearly indicated by a variety of legal firms. It is interesting to note that major legal firms around this country&mdash;which really do not have any interest in where their clients come from, which are prepared to represent people who come to them&mdash;are saying that this legislation is a lawyers' bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a lawyer, as is the honourable member for Higgins, and we are both members of the bar. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) also comes from this noble profession. It would be fine for our members back at the bar and in legal practice to be told, `Well, listen, colleagues, this is an example where we are able to say to you that after this legislation has passed through this Parliament there will be more money to be made by you out there'. We are not saying that. We are saying that this Government, which pretends to say it wants to cut down legal costs, and pretends&mdash;in the words of Shakespeare&mdash;to say, `Let's kill all the lawyers', comes in here with legislation which will do exactly the opposite. </PARA>

<PARA>As I indicated in the debate on the second reading, the Opposition is moving a number of substantive amendments to improve the proposal which has been put forward by the Government; some might say to radically alter it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of these amendments is to take out the offensive aspects of the Government's proposal for class actions and to effectively introduce a system for representative proceedings which would be modelled on the best practice in the State supreme courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new section 33C allows seven or more persons having claims against the same person, where those claims are in respect of or arise out of the same or substantially the same circumstances and where those claims give rise to a common issue of law or fact, to have a proceeding commenced by one or more representing all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representative proceedings as would be allowed by my proposed amendment could be in respect of a broad range of matters to be litigated, such as equitable relief damages and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes which are proposed in this amendment to section 33E would provide that those persons who wished to be represented in the representative proceeding would, before the commencement of the proceeding, consent in writing to being represented and their names would be entered in the process by which the proceeding was commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would allow persons who wanted to bring their action as a representative proceeding to effectively opt in. So that persons who had a claim and wished to have it litigated, merely by giving a written consent, could have their claim litigated as part of the one action, could have their claim litigated with the economies of scale that that would involve and could have their claim litigated in such a way that it would avoid multiplicity of proceedings. But their individual rights would not be compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would choose to exercise their rights. Their rights would be exercisable upon their written consent rather than as is proposed in the Government's Bill for their rights to be exercised for them if they failed to notify the court that they wished to opt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would effectively provide a system which is consonant with the exercise of traditional legal rights as we know them which would not encourage the worst features of the American class action system; nor would it be a boon to entrepreneurial lawyers with all of the flaws which the Government legislation has as I outlined in my speech during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments which should be taken as a whole with these are really consequential on that fundamental change; the fundamental change from the opt-out system proposed by the Government's Bill to the opt-in system proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for example, the amended section 33H would make provision for the group members who have opted in to be named in the proceeding, the nature of the claim specified, the relief specified and the common questions of law or fact common specified as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that the Opposition moved amendments substantially to this effect in the Senate. There are some slight differences to the amendments we have moved in the Committee. That is because we have had additional time to work on the amendments proposed and to clarify and refine them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate, for example, we had proposed amendments which would have only allowed representative proceedings to be commenced if the claim had been the same; whereas these amendments would allow representative proceedings to cover those persons who had the same or substantially the same circumstances, and where there was not necessarily the same issue of law or fact, but a common issue of law or fact so that it would be wider to that extent. It also reflects what is substantially the position in the Supreme Court of Victoria, which is the leading model in relation to representative proceedings as they now stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 33J would be amended by our proposed amendment to provide the right of group members to withdraw their consent. It specifies the circumstances in which that could occur. Section 33L would allow the action not to proceed as a representative proceeding if it appeared that there were fewer than seven group members. As a result of these changes, there would be no need for a section 33M or section 33N as is proposed in the Bill. Section 33M provides for the Government's class actions to be effectively terminated where the cost of distributing money is excessive. Section 33N provides that the proceeding would not continue as a representative proceeding where the costs were excessive. That is quite a feasible position where class litigation is being operated on an opt-out system. When representative proceedings are being operated on an opt-in system, those particular provisions would not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must concede that those provisions are welcome as part of the Government's scheme. At least they allow a bit of brake on frivolous and vexatious claims. But in relation to our scheme, the substantive scheme itself would operate as a brake on frivolous or vexatious claims. So those particular sections would not, in fact, be necessary. Consequential amendments are proposed to section 33P as a result of the amendments to sections 33M and 33N. They allow a proceeding to be continued by a representative party in the event of the representative proceeding being terminated under section 33L. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made provision in this alternative code which we put forward for settlement of representative proceedings and individual claims on notice. It is very important that the code be read and understood as a code. Effectively, it is put forward as a code in opposition to the Government's code, which has now been passed at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to respond in detail to each of the points that we have made in relation to the amendment. I indicate that the Government tonight is represented by the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services. No doubt, he is an expert on class actions. He is representing the Government tonight while the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is overseas. It is indicative of the way in which the legislation is being rushed through that it cannot even wait until the Attorney-General is back in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister said before, it took the Law Reform Commission 11 years to report. It took the Government about three years to reject the report of the Law Reform Commission. But the Government's Bill was introduced as recently as September 1991. It is absolute nonsense to say that, because class actions have been discussed or were on the agenda of the Law Reform Commission 11 years ago, everybody knows what is in this Bill. It was not until September of this year that anybody knew what the shape of the Government's legislation was going to be. It was not the legislation as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. If we had all been discussing the legislation of the Law Reform Commission, we would not have been able to make specific comments on this Bill, which is entirely different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity that is involved is probably indicated by the length of time that it took the Law Reform Commission to come to any recommendation and then the length of time that it took the Government to reject it, that is, 11 years and three years respectively. Then the Government says that, once it  released its Bill in September, there will have been enough discussion of its proposals in two months. It took 11 years for the Law Reform Commission to discuss it and three years to reject its proposal. Then the Government tries to pretend that in two months an entirely different and new proposal can be given adequate public airing for everybody to be acquainted with what is in it. If it has been given adequate airing and if the Government is acquainted with it, I look forward to the specific response it will make to each and every one of the specific amendments that we now move in committee. No doubt, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, representing the Attorney-General, will be able to respond in detail, this matter having been discussed at such length. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian economy really is still as flat as the proverbial tack. Unemployment is at 10 per cent plus and, I am afraid, will rise as a result of further recession, high real interest rates and the impact of industrial structural change in key industries. Investment in plant and equipment is in decline at minus 10.6 per cent for 1990-91.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in the statement on the economy by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are to be applauded but, to my mind, in all probability, are not sufficient to accelerate and sustain what is at best a sluggish, slow and patchy recovery from deep recession. I am reminded of the old joke about Richard Nixon's alleged toughness. Nixon is watching a man drowning 20 feet from the shore. Throwing the distressed swimmer a 10-foot rope, Nixon says, `There, I have now met you halfway'. The recent one per cent reduction in official rates and the initiatives announced by the Prime Minister in his statement are welcome. They are overdue, though and, in my mind, they are only halfway measures. The $115m extra funding for TAFE in 1992 will produce places for 40,000 more young people in the technical education system, and the advance of $15m to higher education capital funding is well justified. So is the $124m extension to the Government's labour market programs, including Newstart, Jobstart and Skillshare. This extra funding of places within the labour market program system means that 300,000 unemployed Australians will receive job training in 1992, at a cost of $774m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government for all this, and the Prime Minister is correct when he says that we must strengthen the skills of job seekers and the long term unemployed. It makes economic sense to do so, by ensuring that skills shortages do not emerge during recovery. But, as a government, we do have the responsibility, and indeed the moral duty, to ensure that this recovery occurs within a reasonable time frame. No economic growth means no employment growth, and there is no point in having the world's best trained dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the acceleration of expenditure on infrastructure with high economic returns to the nation has been dealt with in this statement. With the exception of the announcements regarding the construction of the Kingsford-Smith third runway and for the proposed development of stage one of Badgerys Creek airport, the remaining capital works projects, as announced, are of small economic and employment consequence. I am speaking of the advancement of $100m-odd of road and rail spending, which is welcomed, but not of major economic significance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several industry policy initiatives are also detailed, and they are welcome steps in the right direction. I speak of the $10m to DIFF; $15m to restructuring in TCF; and $10m to the AIDC by allowing retention of profits. This is, I think, the most important of these small but necessary measures and, indeed, it should assist in meeting demand for development capital for new projects. I can only add: do not sell the AIDC; instead, beef up its capacity to provide capital for value added projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Budget debate recently, I indicated that I was not convinced that a strong recovery will be under way by Christmas 1991, or that the Budget GDP growth forecast of an average of 1.5 per cent will be achieved in 1991-92. I still hold to this assessment. I am very sceptical of the Budget assumptions, repeated in the Prime Minister's statement that `the main growth sources will be housing investment, business re-stocking, and growth in private consumption'. Private domestic demand is projected to rise only from minus 2 per cent to minus 0.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing finance actually fell by 7 per cent in September. This will soon be reflected in subsequent housing approvals and starts. Anyway, even if the IPC projections of 136,000 housing starts are achieved in 1991-92, this very moderate housing recovery simply cannot lead Australia out of deep recession. The latest Westpac <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Market Insights</EMPHASIS> magazine says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with the rural and construction sectors in deep recession and little prospect of a strong stimulus from world recovery, the turnaround in the domestic economy next year looks certain to be modest.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I agree. The United States is still locked in recession. Manufacturing output there is down and retail sales are also down. It fears a double dip recession. Even with a Budget deficit of $US300 billion plus, major stimulatory actions, via tax cuts, are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese and German economies are slowing markedly. No stimulation from overseas seems forthcoming. So the domestic outlook is still grim, and it is hard to understand the sanguine approach of some elements of the economic bureaucracy in this country, and even some Ministers. We just have to move faster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is inflationary, it is regressive and its impact upon the current account deficit, investment, employment and national savings is simply unpredictable. Furthermore, the figures underpinning an extremely wide-ranging package of, on my count, $42 billion to $44 billion, involving massive changes to six or seven separate tax regimes, compensatory measures, huge cuts to Federal programs and a large privatisation agenda, must be rubbery and conjectural in the extreme. Will the GST raise $27 billion? How can honourable members opposite guarantee that? Will the $10 billion government savings and the $5 billion privatisation programs be realised and the revenue achieved? How can they guarantee it? The whole package swings on some hugely heroic assumptions. The fundamental flaw in the basic arithmetic is that, in addition to the $27 billion envisaged revenue from the GST, $10 billion worth of program cuts and a $5 billion privatisation program are needed to balance the numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $27 billion revenue from the GST finances the $26.8 billion required to terminate other taxes&mdash;that is, wholesale sales tax, $9.4 billion; payroll tax, $5.8 billion; petrol excise, $6.6 billion; customs duties, $3.3 billion; and export levies&mdash;mainly the coal export levy&mdash;$1.7 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pay for the $13 billion income tax cuts and the $6 billion for compensation to social security recipients, and for some additional social security measures, the coalition has resorted to a wide-ranging `savings' program and a $5 billion annual privatisation sell-off. The coalition package is, in effect, a net transfer of tax liability from business to the consumer&mdash;that is, to wage and salary earners and pensioners. Putting the numbers another way illustrates this, I believe, even more clearly. The GST raises $27 billion which, in effect, almost finances the abolition of wholesale sales tax, at $9.4 billion; the income tax cuts, at $13 billion; and the compensation package, at $6 billion. This really is the narrow GST package&mdash;GST and necessary compensatory adjustments. But the revenue from cuts to government spending and the privatisation program is still required to finance the termination of payroll tax, customs duties, petrol excise and export levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the total transfer from business to consumer in tax liability is thus probably around $12 billion per year. The Opposition has totally glossed over the cataclysmic effects of its `savings' program. For example, it glibly proposes to slash $90m from employment, housing and education programs for the most disadvantaged Australians&mdash;Aboriginals. Also, $400m is to be withdrawn from capital expenditure for public housing construction, and $719m is cut from State financial assistance grants, even as the Premiers push for a greater certainty of Commonwealth funding. But the real crunch is to occur in health and social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a shocking record in health policy. Its hatred of Medicare is exceeded only by the AMA. So it again proposes to attack Medicare by cutting a net $810m from health by using the old carrot and stick strategy. The Medicare levy remains, but one still must pay into private health insurance funds. The carrot and stick is needed to enforce this added impost on health service consumers&mdash;income tested tax rebates to wage and salary earners and pensioners and penalties upon high income earners who are loyal to Medicare and refuse to be pushed into expensive and wasteful private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extraordinarily high $2.4 billion is to be carved from the social security programs by the Hewson plan. Sole parents are attacked, losing their benefit for children over 12 years of age. Why force single parents onto the dole at a time of high unemployment, at a sensitive time in the life of a child? The unemployed, through no fault of their own, are to be forced off Job Search allowance after nine months and the new unemployed must wait longer for their benefit and sustenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If unemployment is to remain at 8 per cent to 9 per cent for some years, why does the Opposition wish to attack the innocent victims of ongoing recession and structural reform in key sectors of industries? I think the sharpest exposure of the Opposition's proposals to transfer tax responsibilities lies in its proposals for income cuts. In 1994 a person earning $20,000 per year would receive a once-off reduction of $15.60 per week. A person earning $90,000 per year is to get a $98 per week reduction, rising to $150 per week two years later. What does it matter if a low income earner gets a 28 per cent tax cut and a high income earner gets only 15 per cent, if in fact the difference in benefit is $130 per week in favour of the wealthy? One cannot spend percentages, and one requires dollars in the hip pocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the coalition assert that Australia must now digest a huge goods and service tax? As the Governor of the Reserve Bank says, `It is ill-timed, unnecessary and inflationary'. I believe that it requires a Herculean act of faith to dogmatically assert that the inflationary increase from a 15 per cent GST will be only 4.4 per cent. Does the assumption include changes to health insurance? No. Will all the cuts in wholesale sales tax and payroll tax be passed on in lower prices and/or increased employment? One can be absolutely sure that the inflationary expectations and inflation will rise by more than 4.4 per cent. Honourable members should take a look at the 1988-89 New Zealand experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If even short to medium term inflation rises by even 2 per cent more than the coalition forecasts, Australia would face a 10 per cent plus inflation rate, meaning tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates&mdash;less investment, and tighter fiscal policy than even the Opposition envisages. This is a sure scenario for employment loss rather than employment creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean that the measures announced by the Prime Minister are, in my view, all that is required at this time, or that the recovery is definitely on track. This Labor Government must not only expose the injustice and flaws of the Hewson package, but also initiate further policy to promote economic and employment growth. Australia demands vision, hope and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Official interest rates must fall another one per cent and very soon. Real Australian bank bill rates are 4.5 per cent higher than US Euro rates. A devalued Australian dollar would stimulate investment. I think export facilitation credits should be extended to cover all value added exports. The business tax review should be expedited and should result in accelerated tax write-offs for investment in plant and equipment. The outcome of the March economic statement's arrangements is definitely inadequate and we should speed up that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we cannot agree with the Opposition's proposed GST or the States' proposed 6 per cent State income tax surcharge; but a proposition which agrees to the maintenance of State financial assistance grants in real terms for five years from an agreed base which compensates for a phase-out of State payroll taxes is achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not need a bloated, flawed, meretricious, and regressive $42 billion goods and services tax and expenditure cuts package. What Australia requires is an achievable mix of business tax initiatives and industry policy to encourage investment, exports and employment. We need such a package fast; we do not need the Opposition's GST package. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

They were two of the more interesting bedfellows who joined the ranks of the immediate past Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enter this debate tonight to say a few things about the outlook for employment in Australia. In the course of it, I want to deal with some of the more absurd and emotional criticisms that have been made of the Fightback economic statement released on behalf of the coalition parties by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) last week. There is not the slightest doubt that this document has been widely acclaimed throughout Australia, because in contrast to the policies of the Government, this statement is an honest attempt to address the fundamental problems of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is at the table, and those who might disagree with our approach to economic management, to some words uttered by Mr Peter Robson, the Federal Secretary of the Public Sector Union&mdash;undoubtedly a man who has voted for the Australian Labor Party all of his life, and undoubtedly a man who will vote for the Labor Party at the next Federal election. He is one of the key players in the public sector unions of Australia. He said, `I do not agree with the philosophy of the Leader of the Opposition. I am against the policies contained in the document but at least he has stated in detail his vision and his attitude to what ought to be done for the future of this country'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the House that the reason this document has been so widely acclaimed, and the reason that this document has instilled a sense of electoral terror into the hearts of every marginal seat holder, and many more in the Labor Party, as evinced by its miserable performance at Question Time&mdash;I will come to that a little later&mdash;is that the Opposition has been prepared to nail its colours to the mast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition&mdash;sensing the mood of despair, disillusionment and discontent in the Australian community, and the feeling on the part of people, whether Labor voters or Liberal voters, that there is something fundamentally wrong with economic management in Australia at present&mdash;has filled the leadership vacuum created by the failing fortunes of a tired and disintegrating government. If one wanted any evidence of the fatigue and the degree of disintegration, one could find it at Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I entered this Parliament in May 1974. I watched the disintegration of the Whitlam Government; I experienced some of the difficulties in the harder, more arduous days of the Fraser Government; and I have watched the fortunes of this Government. I have not seen a worse Question Time performance from any government than the one I witnessed today. It was a Question Time performance bereft of any sense of direction from the Government. It was presided over by a man whose confidence has been shot to pieces because he knows that behind him lurks a disloyal rebellious group of people who are literally keeping their silence like Trappist monks publicly, yet privately praying that the Prime Minister's attempt to knock over the Opposition's taxation policy will fall into a miserable heap. If today's performance in Question Time is any guide, that is exactly what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen a more miserable low-grade performance from a Deputy Prime Minister. When I think of the people who have occupied that post I think of Lionel Bowen, a man admired and respected on our side of politics and his own, and I think of Doug Anthony. Then I think of the miserable contribution of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) today. So flustered was he that all he could do was indulge in a cheap personal jibe at the Leader of the Opposition. In doing so, he condemned himself out of his own mouth. He brings great discredit on that position, he brings great discredit on his Party and he brings great discredit on the Prime Minister. Shoulder to shoulder, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister stitched together the numbers to enable the Prime Minister to survive last June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If today is repeated&mdash;as I believe in one form or another it will be for the remainder of this week&mdash;and if the Parliament sits again before Christmas, there cannot be any doubt that the dogs will be well and truly barking over the Christmas barbeques. The Labor Party backbench will get the clear unmistakable message that it cannot possibly win with this disintegrating rabble. It has a Treasurer who cannot answer the most fundamentally simple economic questions without a voluminous Treasury brief. It has a Prime Minister who cannot command the attention of the House. It has a group of people sitting behind it half of whom are conspicuously disaffected and who are hoping and praying that the Prime Minister's attack on the economic package launched by the Opposition is a miserable failure. The Minister who has just taken his place at the table, the Minister for Resources and honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), in a very portentous and overperformed delivery at Question Time endeavoured to support the puny endeavour of the Prime Minister to undermine the commitment to abolish fuel excise. </PARA>

It has been widely and deservedly acclaimed as an honest attempt to address the economic problems of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I found most interesting about the Newspoll in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was not so much the very comforting overall result for the coalition&mdash;that was very welcome&mdash;but the comment of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian's</EMPHASIS> political correspondent, Glenn Milne, when he said that this package has been identified as a national rescue plan. That poll was indicating to the people of Australia and to the readers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that a large number of Australians were saying, `I don't know whether it is good for me or bad for me or whether it is middling for me, but I do know it is good for my country and therefore I am going to support it'. That demonstrates that we have produced a plan that tries to address the fundamental problems of this country. The Government may not like it and it may not agree with it, but it has to concede that it is an honest and thorough attempt to address the fundamental economic problems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response that those opposite have to adopt to the economic policy launched by the Opposition last week is not to nitpick, carp or overindulge in rhetoric but to acknowledge that there are many things in it that are good. I hope that my colleague from Hinkler, who represents a non-metropolitan area of Australia, will recognise the enormous benefits bestowed on rural and provincial Queensland by the proposal to abolish fuel excise. I hope, in the context of speaking on an economic statement dealing with employment, he will recognise the enormous contribution to job creation through the abolition of payroll tax. I hope he will recognise that when we take $20 billion of the current tax burden off Australian business, we endow it with a capacity to employ Australians that it does not currently have. That is an unarguable statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the only way we can get employment growth going again in this country is to get a genuine resumption of economic growth. The honourable member for Cunningham said that no economic growth means no employment growth. He is absolutely right. I cannot think in the present economic circumstance of something more likely to get a resumption of economic growth and therefore a resumption of employment growth than taking the tax yoke off Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite unashamedly acknowledge, as did the Leader of the Opposition, that this is a pro-business package. A pro-business package is a pro-jobs package; an anti-business package is an anti-business package. That is the rationale. Businesses employ people. The unemployment that Australia is now experiencing is very different from what it has experienced in the past. It is spreading through the community. Over the past few months there has been a middle classing of job insecurity the like of which we have not seen in this country in my political experience. It was certainly here in the dark years of the Great Depression but on no other occasion in the past has it existed in quite the form it now takes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why those numbers are still very indifferent, the reason why the housing starts, after looking promising, have petered out, the reason why the motor vehicle registrations are not doing as well as people would like, the reason why every company director who says anything about the economy is restrained about our prospects over the next 12 months, is that people are scared stiff of losing their jobs. It is not much good saying that people can borrow money to buy a house at 8 per cent or 9 per cent because if they do not have a job they cannot even afford to pay the interest at 5 per cent, let alone the present level of 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a climate of escalating job insecurity, falls in interest rates do not even touch the sides. If people are puzzled as to why we are not seeing a surge in housing activity, despite the fact that we have had major falls in interest rates, we only have to look at the level of job insecurity. Into that situation, the Opposition has injected a visionary, bold, different, honest attempt to address the fundamental problems of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to those opposite that they should by all means join us in debate and by all means try to demonstrate to us that there are superior ways of improving the Australian economy, but they should not insult us. More importantly, they should not insult the Australian people by endeavouring&mdash;as the Treasurer and Prime Minister, to their great discredit, did today&mdash;to dismiss our plan as some kind of absurd fantasy. Those opposite might argue that it is erroneous, they might argue that it is wrong, but they cannot argue that it is flippant, flimsy and irrelevant. They have to take it seriously, because the Australian people have taken it seriously. If they are to remain in the political ring over the next 12 months they have to give a serious, and not a flippant, response to that program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak tonight in support of the statement which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last week of sitting of this Parliament. There were basically four initiatives: the initiative in the post-secondary area to ensure that our young men and women have access to training in the long term as well as in the short term; a further expansion of labour market programs to assist the unemployed obtain and upgrade skills; the acceleration of infrastructure projects in the areas of road, rail, post-secondary education and science; and the facilitation of the development of new industries and the restructuring of existing industries. These measures totalled some $313m in the 1992 calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it was important and responsible that the Government did not throw money at the world recession which Australia is in, that it made a very sensible and guarded response to the problems faced by this country. The problems we face are very complex. One of the biggest problems is the fact that we are involved&mdash;unwittingly and unwillingly&mdash;in a trade war. We have seen a crash in commodity prices. Approximately 80 per cent of our primary products have to be sold overseas in markets that are corrupted. We have a severe drought in more than half of New South Wales and Queensland. Consequently, many issues are simply beyond our control. Nevertheless, there are issues that are under our control, and we have continued to address those issues since we have been in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that at the present time we have the second lowest level of total taxation of the OECD countries. We have inflation whipped; it is down to 3 per cent. Inflation is the greatest enemy of any country that wants to get into the trade world. Because we are so reliant on trade and because we are a trading nation with such a small population, it has been important that we should hold the line and have the courage to take on inflation as the number one enemy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at market labour costs and industrial relations we can see that under Labor there has been a reduction by some 10 per cent in non-farm unit labour costs since the Hawke Government came to power. If we look at the participation rate in the work force now vis-a-vis that of the 1950s or the 1960s, in real terms we have the best record in industrial relations. That has come about not by using a stick or dividing people but as a result of working together, through the accord, with the trade union movement and through commonsense. They are the sorts of things that have to be put into place if we are to become a competitive nation. They are the things that are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that while these things have been accomplished we have been hit with a world recession, a recession we were going to have whether we liked it or not. Because we could not avoid it, we were caught up in it. Had we not made the structural changes we have, we would be in a much worse position today. Nevertheless, I concede that people are hurting out there. I know what it is like. I talk to the people in my own electorate and across this country. There is no doubt, as a consequence of that hurt, that people will take notice of an alternative package that has been put forward by the Opposition during this last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is healthy and constructive for us to debate the pros and cons, the rights and wrongs and the direction we should take, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), said. I think that is healthy, because it is important to draw a clear distinction between what we on this side of the House have to offer and what those on the other side have to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday night, as part of the Labor Party's centenary celebration, I had the privilege of addressing a Labor Party function in Roma, right in the heart of where our Party was formed in western Queensland. I made the observation there that I will make here tonight: nothing has changed in 100 years; the views, the prejudices and the principles that apply on either side of this House have not changed. There may be better clothes and better fashions, there may be better transport and technologies, but nothing has really changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition has put forward in its package is not just the GST; it is industrial relations, it is a redistribution of wealth, it is welfare. We should look collectively at the whole package, and then we should look at our side of the House. There is a clear distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not apologise for giving compassion a high priority. I do not apologise for caring about people. In 1891 we had a deep recession. The argument then was that people should be driven through the floor. In Queensland, the State Government bought a crooked magistrate and sent out 600 troopers to enforce its industrial relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me in the parcel of voluntary agreements is that those who can least afford it will be those most affected, that is, the unemployed, the aged, the frail and the single parents. Many single parents out there bear a stigma not of their making. It is very popular to attack single parents. I have a lot of single parents in my electorate; some of them are single parents because of car accidents, because of illness from cancer and many other problems. What disgusts me is that all these people are put into the same category and used in the attack by the Opposition. It is very easy to do that. It is just as easy for me to attack people and call them yuppies, because people will not stand up and say that they belong to that category. But 95 per cent of the people who are single parents are single parents through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some people who make mistakes. There may be some people who make mistakes more than once. But I do not believe we should punish the children.

I believe it is the duty of those on both sides of this House to fully explain the package to the community so that they can clearly understand what is represented by the Opposition's propositions for changes in taxation and what we propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose the second lowest level of taxation in the OECD countries. One of the interesting parts of this debate about removing the wholesale sales tax from primary producers and the business sector is that the changes that have just been introduced are worth approximately $454m. Changes affecting the majority of input costs and some of the inadequacies that were previously on the backs of farmers were announced in the May statement and came through recently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the honourable member from Victoria mentioned watermelons three times. When we come to the horticulture industry let us talk about the local domestic market. The horticulture industry in Queensland is worth $700m per annum. Of that, 82 per cent represents domestic produce. That means that 82 per cent of the industry would be taxed at 15 per cent in the domestic markets. A quick calculation indicates that that represents about $80m in taxation being taken off the farmers&mdash;money that would not go into their pockets, but would go into a conservative government's coffers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this tax would do for farmers, for the horticultural industry; it would tax them at 15 per cent. Sure I heard the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) on Friday on the Henshaw program skite about how this tax will be good for tomato growers in Bundaberg because they will be able to export without input costs. The problem is that the majority of tomato growers in Bundaberg supply a domestic market. They would be taxed at 15 per cent. On top of that, in the export market inflation would double at least, based on the conservatives' figures. Let us look at what would happen, given the experience in New Zealand and other countries. Inflation would triple at least. What will happen as inflation goes up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave the honourable member for Mayo to work out his own calculation as to what the level of inflation would be. It would double at least. The Opposition has put out a figure of 4.4 per cent as a minimum. In anyone's calculation, that is double. That would make us less competitive in the export industries. At a time when we have endured the pain and got inflation down, the Opposition cowboys want to double inflation and make us less competitive. Surely to goodness, the Opposition can understand simple logic. The Opposition would tax farmers in the domestic market. The pork industry, the poultry industry, the peanut industry and the horticulture industry are predominantly domestic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would lob a 15 per cent tax on the farmers' backs. I will let the blokes in the Opposition explain to the National Farmers Federation and to everyone else how they will be better off with the excise exemptions on petrol as the figures start to come through to show that at the most they will get a reduction of 2 per cent or 3 per cent. Let the Opposition try to convince people that all the good-natured people at the top end who will get those reductions will pass them on to the primary producer. If the Opposition believes that, it believes in fairies at the bottom of the garden. In fact, the only thing that has not been promised in the goods and services tax package is a leprechaun for everyone's garden. Quite honestly, I would rather rely on a leprechaun than on the Opposition's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at what it would do for primary producers, we see that it would do nothing for them. It would blow out inflation; it would make us less competitive in the export industries; and it would tax domestic produce at 15 per cent. I say to those opposite that they should have a good think about it when they come back to my area and try to tell the producers there how they will be better off. The Opposition never convinced anyone, no-one at all. </PARA>

We heard the Leader of the National Party talk about the price of toothpaste and other goods coming down. People do not buy a bucket of toothpaste every week. But, my goodness me, they do buy an armful of fruit and vegetables and  they do buy an armful of meat. And those items would be taxed at 15 per cent. Let the Opposition members go to South Bundaberg, to South Brisbane, to where the real heart and soul of this country is, and tell people in those areas that it will do them a good favour by putting a 15 per cent tax on the necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might not matter much that it occurs in the Adelaide establishment, but let me tell those opposite that it happens to matter to working class people. The real difference in this debate over the next 12 months will be that a few working class boys on this side have a good knowledge of events that occurred in the past 100 years. I tell those opposite that they will have the fight of their lives, and they will lose it. We do not intend to let Opposition members, the Visigoths of the twentieth century, ever get to this side of the House. Let me tell them that. They are in for a fight, and they will know it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fighting words from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice)&mdash;no doubt about that. A good man, but a man whose rhetoric needs to be related to his record. The honourable member for Hinkler is a man who is best known in this Parliament for his enthusiastic, passionate support for the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) to overthrow the existing Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to take his place and to lead this country towards some new horizon. The interesting thing, as I pointed out only the other day to the citizens of Bundaberg in the electorate of the honourable member for Hinkler, is that the honourable member for Blaxland, who the honourable member for Hinkler so passionately believes should be the leader of this nation, is the man who in 1985 masterminded the White Paper which proposed the introduction of the broadly based goods and services tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the rhetoric that we heard tonight we even ended up with blood on the wattle. We heard about how the poor would be plunged into greater poverty; how single mothers would simply be destroyed;  how the sky would fall in;  and how the world would stop spinning. But the complete tragedy that he talked about was, of course, very much part of the scheme that was proposed by the honourable member for Blaxland in 1985, supported by the current Prime Minister most passionately in interview after interview around this country, but a Prime Minister who knew all along that it was economically right for this country and that it could not afford to go along with its taxation system that dates back to 1930&mdash;the oldest living taxation system left in the industrialised world&mdash;a Prime Minister who knew all those things needed to change but who, in the end, did not have the political courage to make the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler is one of many Government members who seriously think that they can go out and run a scare campaign about how a flat earth will be created and how the economic equivalent of a nuclear explosion will devastate Australia, and actually expect the Australian electorate to believe it. Government members actually believe&mdash;no, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think they believe it, but they seriously hope&mdash;that enough voters will believe that to re-elect to government a party that has thrown nearly one million people onto the dole and still claims this very day to be a party of compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always hear from the Australian Labor Party&mdash;I have heard it all of my life for as long as I can remember and, presumably, all the people older than I am have heard it all their lives&mdash;that it claims to be the party of the workers and the party of compassion. Yet, whenever the Labor Party has been in office, there has been an economic crisis in this country. The people who have borne the brunt of that crisis are not the rich, they are not the members of the Adelaide establishment drinking cocktails in the Adelaide Club that Government members love to deride, they are not the people who live in Toorak or Rose Bay or wherever; they are the working people of this country. It is the low income people of this country, the people on the supporting parents benefit, who always bear the brunt of the hypocritical policies of Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go right back through history. The Watson Government lasted for how long?  Six months. And it was thrown out by the Parliament for incompetence. The Fisher Government was quickly thrown out as being economically incompetent. The Scullin Government, which masterminded massive unemployment in this country, was consigned to the dustbin of political history. By the way, it was the government that introduced Australia's current consumption tax&mdash;the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the Whitlam Government&mdash;there was a war at the time of the Curtin and Chifley governments, so we can excuse them for difficult circumstances&mdash;which plunged this country into economic chaos, to the extent that even members of the current Ministry admit that the Whitlam Government was little short of a disaster. I do not think any Australians who are old enough to remember the Whitlam Government would deny that it was nothing short of an economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along comes the Hawke Government, and nearly one million people are simply thrown onto the dole. That is the record of the party that claims to be the party of the workers and the party of compassion. So I think it is only right for the 17 million people of this country to change their attitudes to politics once and for all, to set aside the rhetoric that they have heard from the Labor Party for 100 years and recognise that this is a political party of economic illiterates and economic incompetents that has done immeasurable damage to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government, in its speeches on the statement that we are debating today and its denigratory contributions in Question Time, has the audacity to come into this Parliament and defend its record. This Government seriously thinks the most comprehensive economic program ever put forward by a political party in this country, the Hewson Fightback program from the Liberal and National parties, should be dismissed out of hand with a handful of trite cliches about the poor being made worse off and the rich better off, suggesting instead that Australians would be better going on in the way they are today. Nobody in this country will believe that is a sensible proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major social problem of this country today, unemployment, combined with falling living standards for those who are lucky enough to have stayed in work through the time of the Hawke Government, flows from the simple proposition that in the last eight years this country has become internationally uncompetitive. We have massive month by month balance of payments deficits and the largest foreign debt that we have ever had&mdash;a foreign debt which is one of the largest in the world and certainly the largest of the industrialised developed countries. We have a Government that has decided that the way to cope with this foreign debt and balance of payments problem is not in the obvious way, to make the country more competitive&mdash;and there is absolutely nothing in the Prime Minister's statement about making this country more competitive&mdash;but to put up interest rates to the highest level they have ever been and to plunge this country into a recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession did not happen just because there was a recession in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo or New York; the recession was deliberately engineered by the Labor Party as the solution to the balance of payments crisis and our foreign debt crisis. That was the reason the Government engineered the recession in this country&mdash;and it admits it. Nobody in the Labor Party would seriously deny that that was the reason for the recession. Let us be fair to Government members: they probably do not think it is fun to plunge nearly 1 million people onto the dole in the way a child might think it is fun to tear the wings off a fly, although one could be excused for thinking that. They did it because they thought it would solve the foreign debt, unemployment and balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Government members are not talking about the foreign debt and the balance of payments. Honourable members might recall that two years ago Government members were saying that we have to have interest rates high to deal with the balance of payments and foreign debt problems. When people said to them, `But our inflation is rather high', they used to say, `We are not like the tories over there. We do not have a fight inflation first strategy as the Fraser Government did. That is not our strategy. We are not concerned about inflation; we are concerned about the balance of payments and the foreign debt'. What happened? The Government plunged this country into the worst recession for 60 years. One of the consequences of that, just as it was a consequence in the 1930s and in 1961 when this country was in recession, was that the rate of inflation plunged as well. That obviously happens in a great recession or a depression. Prices fell very dramatically in the 1930s, they fell in the early 1960s, and the rate of inflation has obviously fallen in the last few months in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government's latest argument? It does not talk about the balance of payments or the foreign debt problem. The latest argument is, `Well, we have actually been pursuing a strategy to mop up inflation'. So the latest argument is about inflation. Guess what the Government has done. By accident, it has reduced the rate of inflation when what it was trying to do&mdash;and it is fair; any serious political party in this country ought to be trying to do it&mdash;was resolve our foreign debt and balance of payments problems. But the Government has done nothing to achieve that, because the only solution to that problem is to make this country substantially more competitive than it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As those opposite&mdash;as Disraeli would have said, that range of exhausted volcanoes over there&mdash;would have to admit, we on this side of the House are not just about being negative and attacking the Labor Party; we are about putting together a complete overhaul of the way in which this country's economy works. Our Fightback package is precisely that. It is the first time in my life that a political party in this country has had the courage to put to the Australian people a program which is not just a populist gimmick and not just trinkets and toys that might prove to be popular and glittering at election time, but a program which is honest, sincere and rational; one which is designed to overcome the problems of this country. The Government may disagree with it but, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, it cannot contest the proposition that this is an honest endeavour to say to the Australian people, `For heaven's sake, don't go on with what we have been doing up until now; let's change direction'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been the coordinator of the tax reform group over the last six months and I know only too well that it is a hard task going around this country convincing people that we should get rid of some of the current taxes and introduce a goods and services tax. If we were about populist politics, if we just wanted to dangle trinkets in front of people and give them handouts to get elected, we would not bother going through that difficult task&mdash;and difficult it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been difficult because it is new and because the wholesale sales tax, the current consumption tax, is invisible, so people do not know about it. That is why it is hard to compare the GST with a wholesale sales tax. But we have done it, not because we are populist and not because we are the next generation of cynical politicians, saying we want to be in this building and we want white cars and the life of luxury, but because we have the courage to say to the Australian people, `We must change direction or we will just continue to sink'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package is basically about that. It gives this country and its 11 million voters a chance to choose. At the next election they will be able to choose whether they want a program that will wipe something like $20 billion worth of tax costs off the production of goods and services in this country to make it more competitive or to continue with the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and all these tired people coming forward with their cliches about caring and compassion but with no policies designed to address the fundamental, competitive problems that this country has. That will be the choice they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, we will make a break with tradition. We will leave it to the Australian people to decide whether they want a fresh opportunity, a fresh start, a reasonable chance to build for themselves, for their children and their grandchildren or to stick with the stale old team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the Prime Minister has said over the years, which I think is right, is worth reflecting on: never underestimate the intelligence of the Australian people. Government members do not seriously think that the people are going to believe that a 15 per cent goods and services tax coupled with the abolition of seven taxes&mdash;including Labor's tax on jobs that the Government has decided to embrace&mdash;is going to lead to a 15 per cent increase in the price of everything they buy and that that is going to lead them on the road to rack and ruin. They will not believe it, so do not try to tell them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Treasury's own figures that the honourable member for Blaxland quoted in April of this year in the Press Club did not show that. No-one will believe Government members, so they may as well give up on that argument and get a little bit more sophisticated. Their only hope of re-election is to develop a completely new program, non-cynical, unencumbered by populist trinkets, and to try to convince people that they will make this country more competitive. They cannot do it, because they are married to the trade unions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of respect for one of the earlier speakers, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who quite tragically was dumped by the Opposition. Undoubtedly, by the proverbial million miles, he is the person with the most ability on the other side. I have a deep respect for him because I think he is a person who generally speaks from the heart, and some of the things that he said I must say I am quite comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the greatest problem that we on this side of the House have is unemployment. There is no doubt that to have nearly a million people unemployed is quite tragic indeed. I believe that all of us really want to do something about easing the horrific problems of the unemployed and the ramifications which flow on to their families. Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to be able to form a committee called the employment marketing committee and was given the responsibility of trying to get a strategy for creating long term employment. The members of that committee worked extremely diligently together. We received submissions from the ACTU, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Mines, the Chamber of Manufactures and many other interest groups that quite genuinely put forward philosophies that we could do something about creating more employment, particularly long term employment, in this country. Some of the job creation schemes, like the RED scheme, the CEP and others, have been very successful in the short term, but our strategy has to be long term employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee presented our report only a couple of weeks ago, and the ministerial statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is based to a large degree on that report. I acknowledge that the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers were good enough to act on that report. However, the Prime Minister's statement is only a first step along the way to implementing that report. It is working in the right direction and I believe that if the whole of it is acted upon we can go a long, long way towards having some policy in place to ease unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that the key to providing a sustainable improvement in the employment sphere is to encourage investment in industry. Government policy and spending should be targeted to ensuring that new enterprises arise and to establishing enterprises that remain viable. In my opinion, in order to provide a sustainable increase in the level of employment, government should provide policy settings to give industry the incentive to invest. Every encouragement should continue to be given to entice industries to invest in areas involved in the production of internationally tradeable goods and services. Emphasis should be put on import replacements and export expansion. The approval process for all levels of industry and business should be simplified through agreements among the Federal, State and local governments. An acceleration of the development process will remove a major disincentive to investment. I recommend that a mechanism be established to simplify and coordinate the processes confronting groups seeking development approval. It should not become another level of bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is continuing to give priority to further easing in interest rates when circumstances permit and, in particular, is aiming for the lowest interest and exchange rates which are compatible with an acceptable inflation outcome. The key task for policy must be in generating sustained employment growth, particularly as it was the blow-out in the current account deficit and the resultant increase in the level of foreign indebtedness that were the root cause of Australia's current economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any policy mix that fails to address the constraint on economic activity will not succeed in delivering sustainable employment growth or lower levels of unemployment. That sustained employment growth is necessary to make sustainable inroads in reducing unemployment is highlighted, inter alia, from the experiences of the 1982-83 recession, notwithstanding high employment growth during the recovery phase from that recession and subsequently only limited progress being achieved in reducing the number of jobless. This was because an overwhelming proportion of more than 1.5 million new jobs created over the period of 1983 to 1990 was taken up by new entrants to the labour force as a result of population growth and the increasing participation of the working aged population in the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future course of labour force participation will again be important in determining the extent to which employment growth translates into reductions in unemployment in the recovery from the recession. The perennial constraints of the current account deficit on levels of high activity in the Australian economy mean that, in order to achieve sustained employment growth, there must be a sustained shift in resources towards the internationally tradeable goods and services industry. It is that output from the traded goods sector that provides the wherewithal to fund increasing levels of demand in the economy generally from which growth in employment will flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, however, that that policy not be overly fixed on promoting investment and productivity in the internationally tradeable goods and services sector to the exclusion of other sectors of the economy. An efficient construction industry, efficient service industries, such as electricity, transport, telecommunications and finance, and an efficient community service and public administration are all necessary to ensure that resources are not drawn from the traded goods sector. In short, the focus of policy should be to promote productive investment in the economy wherever it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implicit from the experience of the 1982-83 recession and, in particular, the difficulties in reducing the numbers of jobless in the short term is the fact that policy also must focus on relieving the plight of the long term unemployed. In the broad, the current stance and direction of the Government's policy settings are consistent with the central task of generating sustained employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, and as was highlighted in the 12 March industry statement, for example, current policy recognises that the broader macro-economic settings of policy must be complemented by micro-economic and other policies more specifically targeted at improving productivity in the economy if Australian industry is to become more internationally competitive. The considerable array of labour market programs now in place, aimed at enhancing the educational, managerial and workplace skills of the labour force, including programs specifically targeted to the long term unemployed, are also integral to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to the task of generating sustained employment growth is that future wage increases be linked as closely as possible to increases in productivity, a point also being emphasised in the current policy focus in promoting greater enterprise based wage bargaining. While, in the broad, the appropriateness of the Government's current policy settings is endorsed, it is considered that within those policy settings greater focus must be placed on improving employment conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big things that the Government must do, and something I see it working fundamentally to do, is to reduce interest rates. We must also bring forward expenditure on public works and infrastructure. We must more effectively coordinate and streamline environmental and approval processes for major projects and show greater decisiveness in considering such projects. We must reduce our immigration and give a greater economic focus to policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must encourage greater equity investment in Australian enterprises by the use of superannuation funds. We must implement a more coherent regional development strategy. We must also implement more effective anti-dumping procedures. We must also provide more generous tax treatment for depreciation and research and development expenditure. We must introduce broader tax incentives for savings and increase assistance for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without an industry policy, it is unlikely that we as a nation will develop industries that are needed to employ our people in circumstances that can maintain our living standards, let alone provide for improvement in this area. To develop such a policy we need to ask what sort of industries we need in Australia. The answer seems obvious. We need to do better the things we do well. We are the world's best miners, and we are good at agriculture. We need to value add to the product we export as primary producers as much as it is practicable to do so. We also need to develop those secondary industries that our great primary industries rely upon. As the world's best miners, we should be exporting mining equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was sad that the Government did not proceed with mining at Coronation Hill. I am on the public record as saying that. It is indeed a pity that we did not do that. The development of our natural resources and the downstream processing of those resources must proceed in harmony with the maintenance of acceptable environmental standards. There is a need to establish clear and unambiguous environmental and other guidelines which must be adhered to by all parties and under which investors can proceed with confidence to develop projects in these and other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to have a clear policy that investors, particularly in the mining industry, will be well aware of when they put money into a proposal. Obviously, where geologists have taken samples and have found rich minerals, as at Coronation Hill, we have to have the courage of our convictions and think of the export dollar and what it can do for Australia. I know the Minister at the table, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), wholeheartedly supports me on this, and I support the Minister. His philosophy is quite right. We have to give clear guidelines to investors in this country so that when they put money in they have a clear goal and they know they are likely to reap the benefits of the proposal they are investing in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have positive policies&mdash;constructive policies&mdash;I think we will go a long way towards resolving this terrible unemployment problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I was given a tour around the Seymour abattoir, which is located in my electorate of McEwen. After a number of delays caused by excessive red tape and regulations, the abattoir reopened on Monday, 4 November, after being closed for more than a year after a long history of industrial problems. This abattoir, like numerous others in Victoria, found that the long and very costly industrial disputes instigated by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union were sending it bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Victorian branch of the AMIEU, and its State Secretary, Wally Curran, have been rightly blamed by farmers and abattoir operators for the closure of 13 country abattoirs in Victoria. These closures have seen the loss of hundreds of jobs and at least $180m in export earnings. Today only one-third of Victorian country towns have their own abattoir, and this shortage of killing works will mean that approximately 100,000 head of Victorian cattle will be shipped interstate this year for slaughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian meat industry has the highest level of strikes, labour turnover and absenteeism in Australia. The only way the Seymour abattoir could be reopened as a commercially viable enterprise was for contract labour to be used. Brian Groves of Troubleshooters Available was called in to supply contract labour and the Seymour Meat Processors Cooperative was formed. This cooperative now has 158 shareholders and wide ranging community support. Despite predictions that it would take some time before the abattoir would be profitable, it turned its first profit last Friday after only three weeks in operation. It is expected the abattoir will record a profit every day from now on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Seymour abattoir is licensed to kill both cattle and sheep. To date the most successful aspect of the venture has been the mutton floor, although the beef section is expected to grow substantially in coming months. Already the mutton floor is running at full capacity and processing between 750 and 800 head of sheep a day. In fact, demand for the abattoir's services in this area is such that it is looking at putting on more workers or extending working hours to cope with the extra orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Operating under contract labour gives the abattoir the flexibility and ability to make those changes to the work force. It also creates efficiencies and increases productivity and profits and results in higher hourly rates, as well as productivity bonuses for the workers. Initially it is anticipated that the 60 contracted workers will work on a rotation basis so that 40 workers are working at the abattoir at a given time, and that they will work for three or four days a week. Under contract labour these hours can be increased if demand at the abattoir increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in stark contrast to the past, when the employer was often faced with having to negotiate extended working hours to fulfil a large contract, sometimes six months in advance. Unfortunately, the option of extended working hours at the Seymour abattoir is being limited at the moment by the restrictive work practices of the only two workers who are trade union members, the meat inspectors, who are not receptive to the idea of working overtime. It is envisaged that this problem will be overcome in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Seymour abattoir will be successful. It is in an ideal location as it is in close proximity to major highways and rail links of vital importance, and it is within easy access of Tullamarine Airport. In addition, there are no similar operations within a 100-kilometre radius, which will help ensure that demand remains high. I wish everyone involved with the abattoir the very best of luck for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to call upon the Western Australian Government, through the Western Australian Police Department, to introduce, as part of its Christmas road safety campaign, the mandatory application of the keep left unless overtaking rule. This, I believe, would be a major factor in improving road safety in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along the way, I want to congratulate the Police Department for its efforts in improving road safety, but I would like to point out that in other States of Australia, the keep left unless overtaking rule is adhered to, and traffic management and traffic safety is certainly the better for it. I want to refer to a couple of regulations. The first refers to traffic law in New South Wales, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keep to the left</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">65. Subject to these Regulations, the driver of a motor vehicle upon a public street shall keep the vehicle as close as practicable to the left boundary of the carriageway, except&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) where there are two or more lanes marked on the carriageway available exclusively for traffic travelling in the direction in which the driver is travelling; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) where the vehicle is being driven upon a shared traffic zone.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the law allows overtaking. It is made clear later in the Motor Traffic Regulations 1935, where, in section 65A (1), it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The driver of a motor vehicle upon a portion of a multi-laned road. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall not drive the vehicle in the lane which is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) furthest from the boundary of the carriageway on the left-hand side of the driver; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) lawfully available for traffic travelling in the direction in which the driver is travelling,</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, keeping left on multi-laned roads unless overtaking is a mandatory requirement under traffic regulations in New South Wales. Also listed under `Traffic Offences' is a requirement which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overtaking</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.3 It is the duty of a driver when following another vehicle and who seeks to overtake that vehicle to pass to the right of that vehicle at a safe distance. The overtaking vehicle keeps the overtaken vehicle on its left.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on and spells out the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A driver travelling in one of those lanes may pass to the left of a vehicle travelling in another of those lanes, if conditions permit him to do so with safety.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that applies if it is a multi-lane road. Quite clearly in the regulations of other States there is provision for traffic to keep to the left unless overtaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, this is not uniformly the case in Western Australia. The Police Department has moved to some extent to adopt this rule, but it is so confusing to the motorists that they do not realise when that rule applies. We have the situation where a person can be travelling on one of our freeways in Perth and find that there is someone in the centre lane travelling at 60 kilometres an hour. I had that experience very recently when an ambulance was trying to get through. There was an elderly driver driving at 60 kilometres an hour in the centre traffic lane. The ambulance driver could not attract his attention and almost caused an accident trying to move to the left of him. That was simply a question where the rule was not being enforced and not being adhered to. As with all of these public education matters, it is one in, all in, or one out, all out. Sadly, it was not the case of the regulations having a uniform application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are dealing with these emergency situations&mdash;the police themselves, the ambulance services and the fire services&mdash;will all say that the keep left unless overtaking rule means that they can get down the centre lane much more quickly. Certainly, even if there is only one lane, but people are keeping to the left, that emergency service vehicle can overtake more readily. Clearly the keep left unless overtaking rule is something that is applied in other States, and sensibly, and it ought to be applied uniformly in Western Australia on all carriageways because the current arrangement is confusing and people do not quite know, when they are on the appropriate carriageway, whether this rule applies. In effect, it does not work because people do not know what the rule should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Police Department and the State Minister: here is an opportunity to have a major initiative in terms of a road safety campaign for Christmas. They will say, `We have achieved a lot in road safety'. The answer is, `Yes, you have, because of seat belt legislation and random breath test legislation'. That is where the big gains have been made, but this would provide a further gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned&mdash;and electors have pointed out to me&mdash;that the Multinova cameras used in Western Australia are used in certain sections of downhill road where the motorist finds it difficult to stay under the speed limit. One wonders what the motivation of the police is in those circumstances and where they have speed traps on very safe sections of double carriageway. We have to get the police to think in terms of how we can assist the motorist to better manage traffic. Certainly, the keep left unless overtaking rule would be one way of achieving that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I apologise for that. It was a slip of the tongue which will not happen again, I assure you. I rise tonight on a sad but important note. Honourable members may or may not be aware of the saga that is going on in Victoria where a strike in the power generation area in my electorate has just been called off. The state of play at this stage is quite simple: there is no agreement between the Government, the unions or the SEC. There is another mass meeting tomorrow to find out which way we are going. In effect, that means that to date a deal has not been done by the unions with the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what this strike is all about. Often the rhetoric in the papers is about a power strike and how it is going to happen, but people need to understand at this stage that this is a strike about a private contractor shifting the overburden from the open cut at the Morwell power station. The significance of a private contractor shifting the overburden is this: for the first time in the history of the SEC, there is a proposal that private contractors operate a dredge and a conveyor belt that will shoot overburden one way. Quite obviously, if they choose to, at a later stage when they get down to the coal, they can shoot coal into the power station. The heart of the question we have to ask today is this: who are the power unions protecting? Are they protecting the workers on the job? I think not. Evidence would show quite clearly they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that is being put to the workers by the private enterprise consortium is that a labourer would receive $34,991 for seasonal work which covers only 24 weeks. Full time labourers, with bonuses, would get the equivalent of $61,247. When we go through the other operators who would be operating the dredge, the conveyor belts, the trucks and what have you, we find that the fitter would get $64,500, the electrician would get $64,500, the dredge operator would get $65,918, the road runner would get $61,247, the stacker-operator would get $62,915, and the labourer, as I said before, with bonuses, $61,247. That is not what one would call an insubstantial wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the union movement looking after in this organisation? It will tell you that it is the workers. Let me tell honourable members that of the 170-odd employees who are employed by the SEC at the moment in that operation, some 130 have approached the contractors to negotiate and to see whether they would like to work with that private operator. Out of 170 employees, 130 have approached the contractors to see whether they would like to operate the machines under private contractors. Why? It is because they will be paid fairly, paid extraordinarily well, for working very hard in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation today in the industry where union muscle is afraid of free enterprise competing in the hallowed open cut in my electorate because it will show up the rorts and perks that the unions have been able to perpetrate on the people of Victoria. The unions do not want to pass on to the consumers of Victoria the $20m in savings that have been projected over five years. They want the featherbedding to go on. This strike is totally preposterous. It is not on in this day and age. In these economic conditions it is high time that the people who are driving this strike come to the reality of the cold wind of hard economic times. In this day and age we need productivity and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. The unions are to be thoroughly condemned for this scurrilous operation they are conducting. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time newspaper columnists and editorial writers criticise politicians of all political persuasions, and I think that is healthy and I think that is important, but when editorial writers and columnists get it wrong and are continually perceived through the media to get it wrong&mdash;the same particular gentleman&mdash;I think it should be pointed out. Whoever wrote the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of last Sunday&mdash;the consistent line has been there for some time&mdash;has got it wrong on trade. Likewise the economist's view by H. W. Herbert in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> has continually got it wrong in regard to trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these two people are protectionists and they have criticised both the Opposition and the Government for supporting the Cairns group and supporting liberalised trade. They imply by their remarks, by the editorial and by Herbert's column that we are letting down Australia by trading bilaterally with Asian and Pacific rim countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote briefly from Herbert's column. He said the Government is unfortunately the leader of the Cairns group and the gurus in the Cairns group are of the view that Asia, the world's fastest expanding region, basically will be able to be exploited by exports from Australia. I have not quoted it word for word. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weakest aspects of the Opposition's logic are precisely those the Federal Government is in the least position to attack. For example, some of the leading members of the Access Economics team are on the record in support of the Garnaut Report, the document fuelling the arguments of the dryer GATT-based Cairns theorists whose naive policy has so devastated Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to criticise the fact that imports from the Asia Pacific rim are coming into Australia. The sad part about this is that both the person who wrote this editorial and H. W. Herbert are ignorant of the fact that Australia exports $19.1 billion to the Asian Pacific rim countries this year and we import $11.6 billion. So if either of these gentlemen have the ability to do sums they would find out that we have a trade surplus in our favour of $7.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If either of these clowns were able to implement his logic into policy we would lose a trade surplus in our favour of $7.5 billion. It is pleasing to see that both the Government and the Opposition understand the importance of liberalised trade, and at a time when we face a world recession and we need everyone in this country to put forward sensible and rational points of view, it does not help when someone who has the power to write an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> from Queensland and some character who calls himself an economist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>, H. W. Herbert, continue to write this nonsense and attack both the Government and the Opposition for doing what is in Australia's interests&mdash;that is fighting for liberalised trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that there are people out there who cannot understand the facts when these sorts of characters in the media have not got the intelligence to find out the facts and report them as such so that people can be better informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting to reflect that Horace Greeley was probably the most vitriolic attacker of politicians for some 40 or 50 years in the United States, and finally Greeley retired and entered politics and stood for the Republican Party and was defeated. He died three months later of a broken heart because he had no guts. He had no ability. But in 40 years behind a pen he was able to attack everyone who had the courage to stand up and make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I suggest to the clown in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> who writes the editorial and to H. W. Herbert is that they find out that it is in Australia's interests to have bilateral trade with Asia and it is in our interests when we have a trade surplus of $7.5 billion to continue to build upon that trade and it is that very essence that is going to help us trade out of our recession. So quite frankly both these characters should go back to preschool and learn the facts of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few days, the coalition parties have launched their Fightback program. It is evident that there will be a fight back because of the treatment that Canberra and the south-east region of New South Wales receive in this program. There will be a fight back all right&mdash;by the same mob that wound down Canberra between 1975 and 1983. In 1975 Queanbeyan was a prosperous region: it had public servants in its office space; the Snowy Mountains scheme was strongly staffed; and people from Canberra travelled to the Snowy Mountains and down to the south coast for tourist purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1983 that had all changed: a four storey block of offices was completely empty in Queanbeyan and trade was down on the south coast and in the Snowy Mountains. In fact, employment is one per cent higher now on the south-east coast of New South Wales than it was in 1984. In Queanbeyan, employment is 3 per cent higher now than it was in 1984. That is what the fight back for Canberra and the south-east region of New South Wales is all about. It is turning back the clock to those sad old days between 1975 and 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at Queanbeyan now, we find that the offices are, once again, substantially full.

The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wants people to live in the real world. Canberra apparently is not the real world. If he sends the departmental heads and their entourages to Sydney and Melbourne, they will go to places such as Lane Cove and stay at places like Toorak. Is that the real world compared with Canberra? I do not think so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Canberra and Queanbeyan we find people of all types. There are derelicts, prosperous big business people, church leaders and people who are involved in a wide range of services, such as wholesale industries and transport industries. Whether we live in Canberra or Sydney, we select our own friends. We associate with people in the Public Service and people in business. There is a great mixture of people in Canberra and it is a natural area for decentralisation. </PARA>

If we look at the proposals of members of the Liberal and National parties in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, we find that they really intend to wind down. The Opposition is going to sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Cooma. Once again, we will see office space wound down; shops closing their doors in Queanbeyan and on the south-east coast; the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority could be considered for dispersement to the States or to private enterprise; and we will see policies which have been developed to sell Telecom. We will see all of that happen. Of course, there are no policies at all on the important resource industries, particularly the timber industry. Where are the Opposition's policies on the fishing industry? It has no industry policies at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The south-east region, particularly the Canberra and Queanbeyan area, is a natural area for decentralisation. It is extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition would think about transferring people to choke up the already choked-up areas of Sydney and Melbourne. We have seen great improvements in this region such as radio, television, water supply and sporting facilities. This is not just because of the local member or just because of this Government; it is because there are people out there who are prepared to share their ideas and the Government is prepared to listen to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the electorate of Eden-Monaro will fight back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Friday. The whole of the front page has been devoted essentially to an attack on the Opposition's package. If it were not for the fact that the Labor Party leaked it 24 hours before and the reporters did not have a chance to distort anything in the first period, it would not have been possible to know exactly what we were about. On Friday, the front page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> was headed in big letters `Bonanza for the Rich'. I am sure that when Mr Peter Hartcher filed the ridiculous comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) before he had even looked at the package, giving the view that it was somehow a bonanza for the rich, he was astonished that the Editor and the subeditors gave that the top billing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday, on the same front page, we have a very sarcastic article by Mr Peter Freeman about the superannuation proposals; a very sarcastic article by Ross Gittens headed `Careful, there's a tax inside that bribe'; and a very sarcastic article by Jenna Price headed `It's family planning the GST way' with a couple shown in a big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday, 23 November, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> chose to put on its front page comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, extracted from a long interview in the magazine section. Mr Fraser has pointed out that they were not authorised by him, they were extracted. He said that he had been cheated by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Certain anti-GST remarks were extracted and put on the front page right at the very top. I think Mr Fraser was unwise to have an interview with Craig McGregor anyway. I think anybody with Mr Fraser's generally sensible economic views would be very unwise to have an interview with Craig McGregor on personal matters; nonetheless I think he was cheated. The replies by the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> are most unconvincing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, under the workers' collective situation that operates at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> since Chris Anderson left, there are chances for some writers to break out from this. Alan Ramsay and Max Walsh, and the person who wrote the editorial on tertiary education, were against this trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in the extraordinary performance of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, one would hardly have known that anything had happened in the previous week. The Editor wrote an editorial on the rural water crisis. He was probably embarrassed by the fact that Peter Robinson had given a favourable response to the Opposition's package, but managed to put on top of that a cartoon which was exactly in line with this `bonanza for the rich' proposal in Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has not been clear of this. It has managed to get Professor Head to come out with a so-called analysis of the package, which contains absolute nonsense. On the back page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> there was this silly cartoon; it ignored the main story; there was an editorial on the rural water crisis; and there were four bitchy pieces in the articles by Candace Sutton about the Opposition's release. It seems to me that at the Sydney end&mdash;and I certainly exclude the Melbourne end of the Fairfax press&mdash;the three editors concerned seem to have a determined policy of denigrating the package. They picked out certain items. Fortunately, there are certain writers with integrity and sufficient independence to go against this trend, but the overall editorial policy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> seems to be determinately against what has been generally approved by the majority of Australian people and written up quite fairly by the majority of the written press and certainly by television and radio. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware of concerns expressed by the Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Funding is allocated to services on the basis of need, and this process is being further refined by the introduction of a needs based planning system. There is no specific priority allocated to people with a disability arising from any specific area of impairment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Historically, most services for people with psychiatric illness have been the responsibility of State/Territory Governments. It is appropriate that services for people while they are psychiatrically ill should continue to be the responsibility of State health agencies. People with stabilised psychiatric conditions who may be considered to retain a psychiatric disability, are a legitimate long term <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> responsibility of the Disability Services Act (DSA). The involvement of the Commonwealth in meeting the needs of those with psychiatric disabilities was expanded in the 1990 Budget, with the establishment of special Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) units in all capital cities, Alice Springs and Shepparton. These will have people with psychiatric disabilities as the major target group. They will provide vocationally oriented rehabilitation programs to people applying for disability pensions who also have a psychiatric history, are not necessarily stabilised, and would not otherwise have access to vocational and rehabilitation options. Under the Commonwealth State Disability Agreement (CSDA) the funding and administrative responsibilities for different types of services are to be rationalised. Under these arrangements, the Commonwealth will administer employment services and States/Territories will be responsible for accommodation and community support services. Decisions on the allocation of specific services will be decided by the type of service and not by the nature of the impairments of individual clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Currently, State/Territory Governments provide a range of services for people with psychiatric disabilities in accordance with their respective State and Territory legislations. However, under the CSDA, which focuses on services which provide ongoing support to people with disabilities to participate in the community, each State/Territory Government is required to enact legislation complementary to the DSA prior to the Agreement coming into effect within a State/Territory. The requirement for complementary legislation ensures the extension of the benefits of the DSA to all people with a disability regardless of whether services are funded by the Commonwealth or a State/Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As services are being provided in response to need rather than targeting specific types of impairment, and in view of the rationalising of disability services under the CSDA, I see no need to review services to persons with psychiatric disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) I am aware that some concerns have been raised about conditions attached to disability and sickness benefits. The following answers to questions 7 and 8 have been provided by the Minister for Social Security:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) (a) Officers of the Department of Social Security are aware that people with psychiatric disabilities often need extra assistance to enable them to comply with departmental requirements and a number of processes have been implemented to address this problem. For example, the Department's computer system will have the facility for noting that a particular client's disability may affect his or her ability to comply with departmental requirements. In such cases special arrangements can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) From November 1991, the Social Security legislation will not require any pensioner, allowee or beneficiary to submit to medical treatment as a condition of payment of income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The payment of sickness allowance will be limited, in most cases, to two years. In specific circumstances, such as a worsening of the medical condition, payment may be made for a further period. The legislation does not place specific time limits on the payment of disability support pension. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Eligibility for pension, benefit or allowance is determined in accordance with the Social Security Act. Examining officers and disability panels have a broad range of discretionary powers regarding the assessment of client's suitability for training, rehabilitation and employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) As part of the changes to income support arrangements for people with disabilities the availability of training, rehabilitation and employment programs has been increased. By 1993-94 there will be: </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Initially, funding provided to States/Territories under the CSDA will be paid as a Specific Purpose Payment (SPP). However, the final method of funding will be decided in the context of the decisions taken at the November 1991 Special Premiers' Conference in relation to vertical fiscal imbalance, tied grants and functional reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that it has been agreed as part of the CSDA that the rationalisation of disability services provision will not be seen by either level of government as an opportunity to reduce funding and that the financial effort for disability services in 1989-90 will be maintained by each level of government. It should also be noted that under the CSDA the Commonwealth is providing significant additional funding to the States/Territories. This funding amounts to an additional $245 million over the five year life of the Agreement; of which $100 million is for growth in services, and $145 million is to improve quality of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) I am aware of the strong community demand for people with disabilities to have the support they need to live in and as part of the community. This demand is acknowledged by the Commonwealth through the DSA, which provides over $300 million to assist in subsidising the cost of such support, provided through appropriate community based organisations. The substantial additional funding made available to the States/ Territories by the Commonwealth under the CSDA will increase the resources available. Despite this significant expenditure by the Commonwealth on community support services, even greater amounts are spent by State/Territory Governments on institutional care. De-institutionalisation, if done with a concern for the clients of such services, will also allow the redirection of the resources that are locked up in large institutions, towards the provision of community based services that meet clients needs. Under the Building Better Cities initiative announced in the recent Budget the Commonwealth will support agreed area strategies to improve Australian cities, which may include institutional reform initiatives by State/Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Under the CSDA, accommodation and other support services for people with disabilities (including those with psychiatric disabilities) which are the responsibility of State/Territory Governments, as well as employment services which are the responsibility of the Commonwealth, will be administered in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement. It is important to note that the CSDA embodies the Principles and Objectives of the Commonwealth Disability Services Act which focus on the provision of quality outcomes for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted, however, that before any transfer occurs within a State/Territory that State/ Territory is required to enact legislation complementary to the Commonwealth Disability Services Act (1986). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it should be noted that Commonwealth and States/Territories agreed at the recent Joint Meeting of Health and Social Welfare Ministers to have a National Mental Health Policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The following is a listing of the more significant measures which are conventionally accepted to be used as non-tariff measures (NTMs) and a description of how each is used by governments to achieve a protectionist outcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prohibition&mdash;embargoes or prohibition of particular imports may be applied for various political, social, economic or sanitary reasons. This measure is usually applied through import regulations. It is often difficult to identify when such measures are used to protect domestic industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quantitative Restrictions including quotas&mdash;explicit limits on quantities imported, either global limits or according to country of origin. These measures are usually applied through import regulations. In certain circumstances such measures are permissible under the GATT, such as to safeguard domestic industries from sudden surges in imports or for balance of payments reasons. However, a number of countries use such measures to provide long term protection to particular industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Import Licensing&mdash;the requirement for a permit prior to import can act as an NTM if procedures are unnecessarily complex or result in lengthy delays in approvals. As the primary purpose of licensing is often genuine, such as statistical collection, it can be difficult to define as a protectionist element. This measure is generally applied under import regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Variable Levies&mdash;variable import levies are like an open-ended tariff and are the difference between the landed import price and an administratively determined price (threshold price) below which imports are prohibited. They are a major NTM on agriculture, in particular those imposed by the EC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs)&mdash;under ``voluntary'' restraint arrangements, exporters agree to limit exports to agreed levels to avoid the imposition of mandatory import restrictions. Examples of Australian exports affected by VERs are beef and steel. Often such arrangements are imposed on exporting countries under threat of more severe restraints if other procedures are adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export Subsidies&mdash;Government payments to exporters enable normally uncompetitive goods to be sold at subsidised rates on world markets. The resultant lowering of prices has a significant effect on the exports of non-subsidising traders such as Australia and can lead to the loss or disruption of traditional markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Production Subsidies&mdash;subsidies can act as an NTM through import replacement by domestic production, not only of production by the firm receiving the subsidy, but also through local content requirements. In addition, subsidies can be used to produce surpluses that are required to be exported. Not all subsidies would be regarded as NTMs, e.g. those not specific to individual firms or industries may not be considered as trade distorting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Packaging and labelling&mdash;national requirements that compel exporters to package or identify goods in a particular way can act as barriers to trade, even when designed for health or safety reasons, rather than as a protectionist measure. Exporters face greater costs than domestic producers by having to meet different national and state requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards&mdash;like packaging and labelling, national standards can be used to impede trade even when designed for quality performance or safety reasons. Particular concerns arise when national standards differ from internationally accepted levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government Purchasing&mdash;Government procurement practices can be used as an NTM if they discriminate in favour of domestic suppliers over more competitively priced or better quality imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases countries devise NTMs in order to restrict imports or to provide a perceived commercial advantage to its industries. The problem in defining the role of NTMs as protectionist measures is that such measures often lack transparency and are difficult to evaluate. Frequently a range of NTMs are applied concurrently. In some cases measures which are considered legitimate in terms of GATT commitments are applied in such a way as to create uncertainty and to harass foreign suppliers. Some other measures can be either inconsistent with countries' obligations to the GATT or are of uncertain consistency with the GATT. These are so-called 'grey area' measures. Of these, the most frequently used today is the voluntary export restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3), (4) and (6). In a major study of NTMs, the World Bank in its 1987 World Development Report, concluded that NTMs have replaced tariffs as the main instrument of protection in many industrialised countries. Since 1974 the incidence of NTMs has increased significantly, particularly in the areas of textiles and clothing, cars, steel, electronics and footwear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank Report indicated an increase in the application of a core group of NTMs on imports by industrialised countries from all sources between 1981 and 1986. The proportion of imports by industrialised countries from other industrialised countries affected by NTMs increased by almost 25% in this period. Statistics gathered by the United Nations over a similar period suggest that the use of NTMs by newly industrialised and developing countries had also increased in certain industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recent GATT reviews of world trade developments indicated that while some new measures had been introduced, most recent changes in measures used to restrict exports were reductions, liberalisation or phasing out of various NTMs. The GATT has identified significant liberalisation in the area of import licensing in a number of countries, particularly those in Latin America and often the replacement of import embargoes with quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts the general conclusion of the World Bank report that since the mid-1970s average tariff levels have declined, particularly in industrialised countries. However, for some countries the use of NTMs as a barrier to trade have become more widespread, especially in the early 1980s. There is evidence to suggest that since the commencement of the Uruguay Round in 1986 there has been a slow down in the use of these measures. Indeed a number of countries have announced substantial trade liberalisation steps including the removal of some NTMs since that time. Australia is continuing to negotiate with its trading partners for the removal of NTMs affecting our vital trade interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) It is an unfortunate fact of life that most countries apply NTMs to varying degrees and for different reasons. In the course of the Uruguay Round agricultural and market access negotiations, Australia has identified the use of NTMs on items of export interest by a number of our major trading partners. These countries, together with some of the key Australian exports affected, are as follows:</PARA>

Furthermore, since the commencement of the Uruguay Round, NTMs on some of these exports have been removed or liberalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no readily available estimate of the additional cost NTMs impose on exports, unlike tariffs which are quantifiable. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, in its 1990 Foreign Trade Barriers Report, has noted the limitations of any valuation put on NTMs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Government has been very active in the Uruguay Round in seeking to eliminate or reduce NTMs on products of importance to Australia. In agriculture Australia is seeking to eliminate non-tariff import measures by their conversion to tariffs. Australia has taken a leadership role on agriculture, including through the coalition of agricultural exporting countries (the Cairns Group) which Australia chairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also negotiating with its major trading partners for the elimination or reduction of NTMs on natural resource-based and manufactured products as indicated in (5) above, as part of the Uruguay Round market access negotiations. Request lists for items of export interest to Australia have been submitted on each of these countries after consultation with interested parties including the Departments of Primary Industries and Energy and Industry, Technology and Commerce, Austrade, the ACTU, industry organisations, individual exporters and State Governments. Australia has also received from a number of our trading partners requests to modify or remove perceived non-tariff measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the market access negotiations, the Uruguay Round is also addressing how existing GATT rules might be tightened to minimise the ability of countries to circumvent their GATT obligations through the use of non-tariff measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the Uruguay Round, the Government has an ongoing commitment to raising NTM issues in international fora, such as the GATT and bilaterally such as the ongoing representations made to the EC on the CAP and coal subsidies; to the United States on the Meat Import Law, sugar quotas applied until recently, EEP and voluntary export restraints on steel; to Japan on rice, coal subsidies, meat quotas and dairy and starch restrictions; and to Korea on import restrictions applied to a range of products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Government's efforts have concentrated on negotiating the removal of NTMs identified as barriers or major distortions to Australian exports. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade intends to publish the results of NTM liberalisation achieved at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. The Government does not support the use of NTMs as a means of combating measures used by our trading partners. Such actions would undermine Australia's international efforts which recognise that NTMs are, in general, trade restrictive and to the greatest extent possible their protective effects should be eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Products imported into Australia are required to meet Australian standards in relation to health, safety, additives, labelling and packaging. Australian standards are amongst the highest in the world. All Contracting Parties to the GATT have the right to determine the rigour by which such standards are applied, provided the same standards apply to imported and domestic products without discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) See answers to 9 and 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Anti-dumping Code) to which Australia is a signatory provides that provisional measures may be taken to prevent injury during the investigation of dumping allegations. These measures may take the form of a provisional duty or (preferably) a security&mdash;by cash deposit or bond&mdash;being not greater than the provisionally estimated margin of dumping. The Agreement makes it clear, however, that provisional measures may only be taken after a preliminary finding has been made that there is dumping and sufficient evidence of material injury, caused by dumping, to the Australian industry producing like goods. Similar rules are prescribed in relation to subsidies. Positive preliminary findings are investigated further by the Anti-Dumping Authority (ADA) which recommends to the Minister whether anti-dumping duties or countervailing duties should be imposed. In the event that the final decision does not support the preliminary finding, any cash securities are refunded without interest being paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) No. In the course of the investigation the Australian Customs Service and the ADA seek detailed information from importers, exporters and applicants to verify their claims and determine whether dumping action is appropriate. If exporters do not co-operate, Customs and the ADA can rely on the best information available, including claims made by the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The Comptroller of Customs is empowered to investigate claims by local industry about alleged dumping and subsidy. The Comptroller, acting in accordance with the GATT and its Codes, must first determine that the matters set out in the application constitute reasonable grounds. As set out in the response to question (12), under the provisions of the GATT neither the Comptroller nor an anti-dumping commissioner may make a preliminary determination without further investigation. Customs has the power to ascertain the landed cost of imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) The period between an application being accepted and a preliminary finding which results in provisional measures being put in place must not exceed 135 days, or 155 days in the case of complex applications. Within the first 35 days the Comptroller must satisfy himself that the matters set out in the application would, if established, constitute reasonable grounds for anti-dumping action. If so, Customs starts an investigation leading up to a preliminary finding. That investigation is required to be completed in the next 100-120 days. During this period Customs investigates the case and verifies overseas and local information contained in the application and any submissions. The GATT Codes require that overseas parties and importers/exporters be given ample opportunity to make representations and Section 269TC of the Customs Act 1901 allows 40 days during the investigation period for interested parties to provide submissions or rebuttals of the claim. After provisional measures are put in place, the ADA has 120 days in which to reach a final finding and recommendation to the Minister on the publication of dumping duty notices. This follows from the GATT Code requirement that provisional measures are not to be in place for longer than four months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) On 12 March 1991 the Government announced an overall reduction of 40 days in the maximum time which can be taken to reach a preliminary finding. The anti-dumping and countervailing system is currently the subject of a review which, among other matters, will examine options for reducing the time to process the application and investigate the claims. The review is expected to be completed by December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17 to 19) Under the GATT, import duties or tariffs can be applied to imports at any level provided that any bindings (commitments on maximum tariff levels entered into in past rounds of trade negotiations) are observed or renegotiated. Such import duties must be applied on a non-discriminatory basis and cannot therefore apply only to subsidised imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures for the introduction of duties to counter such practices are available under Article VI of the GATT and the Subsidies Code. Under the GATT and its Subsidies Code, specific countermeasures can only be applied to imports of subsidised products where it has been demonstrated that a subsidy exists, material injury is occurring or is threatened to a domestic industry and there is a causal link between the subsidy and the injury. Provided these conditions are met, countervailing duties are consistent with the GATT and will continue to be so after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Levying import duties without observing these procedures would put Australia in breach of its GATT obligations and invite action by other GATT Contracting Parties. Furthermore, such a practice would not sit comfortably with Australia's position in the Uruguay Round negotiations on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which is for significant strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) The Government has adopted a multifaceted approach to minimising the exposure of Australian industry to unfair foreign trading practices in its home market and to reduce the incidence of corrupt trading practices in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Government strengthened and streamlined Australian procedures on anti-dumping and countervailing provisions. The maintenance of effective and responsive anti-dumping and countervailing provisions that are consistent with our international obligations remains a central tenet of the Government's industry policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the multilateral level, Australia is seeking improved disciplines on agricultural subsidies, strengthened provisions on anti-dumping and subsidies and the elimination of non-tariff barriers by our trading partners. In the region the Government has accorded high priority within the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (APEC) to detailed analysis of ways to approach non-discriminatory trade liberalisation, with the objective of this becoming a central focus of APEC's work following the Uruguay Round. Bilateral representation by Ministers and officials to other governments is undertaken to prevent or reduce damage as a result of unfair trading practices, including pricing. The Government's bilateral policies are also directed to ensuring Australia is well positioned to take advantage of rapid changes occurring in the international trading environment, including in our own region, Europe, North America and the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) Countervailing measures have been applied under the Customs Tariff (Anti-dumping Act) 1975, where the conditions set down in the Act have been met. These conditions are consistent with the GATT and the GATT Subsidies Code. Tariffs applied to imported goods are established at tariff levels consistent with the Government's tariff and industry policy and are applied on a most favoured nation basis. Tariffs are not related specifically to the existence of a subsidy in one or more supplying countries. The appropriate mechanism to nullify a subsidy is a countervailing duty.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes. He should not however imply from this answer that the Commonwealth will not take proper steps to ensure that the cases are conducted as the law requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member prefaced his question addressed during the adjournment debate by referring to a case of Clarke v. The Commonwealth. That case first came on before Mr Justice Coldrey and, at the conclusion of the opening address for the plaintiff, counsel for the Commonwealth made an application for discharge of the jury on the ground that the address had been inflammatory, misleading and inaccurate. His Honour found that there was a real risk of irrelevant and prejudicial statements included in the opening address improperly influencing the jury and granted the application. I do not consider that the course adopted in that case was in any way improper or that it involved a legal technicality and accordingly, the same course may well be adopted if the same circumstances were to re-occur.</PARA>
