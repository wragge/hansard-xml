<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. In view of the serious damage which United States agricultural subsidies are doing to Australia's agricultural exporters and the potential for our traditional markets in the Middle East to be undermined, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to support our proposal for a senior Australian bipartisan delegation to visit the United States to emphasise the unified Australian position on this issue to senior Administration officials and to the leadership in Congress. Is he prepared to join with me in leading such a delegation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me preface my direct answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question by saying that we are obviously most concerned about the rural recession in Australia. I would like to put on record the fact that yesterday the members of the structural adjustment committee and I had a most constructive meeting with representatives of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) and the Grains Council of Australia in which those gentlemen put forward, I think in a very deliberate and constructive manner, an outline of the depths of the problems confronting Australia's rural community. Within that presentation, they certainly put a lot of emphasis upon the considerable difficulties that have been created for Australia's very efficient rural producers by the actions of the European Community and the United States. In particular, I refer to the most recent subsidy war between the European Community and the United States having caused wheat prices to plummet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members will recall, my colleague the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development made very clear yesterday the depth of our concerns about the United States export enhancement program, which the Administration unfortunately is proposing to expand in 1991-92. I think all honourable members should know that the NFF conveyed to us that the feeling in the Australian rural community is one of very, very deep contempt for and concern about the actions of the United States. Those actions are putting very great strains, as far as those NFF members are concerned, upon their perception of the alliance relationship. To be fair to them, they made it quite clear that they support the Government and the shared bipartisan position in Australia in regard to the Gulf, but they quite honestly have conveyed to me that a continuation of these activities by the United States will put an almost unbearable strain, as far as their membership is concerned, upon their capacity to sustain that position.</PARA>
<PARA> This morning, the Leader of the National Party of Australia wrote to me suggesting that we send a bipartisan mission to the United States. So the initiative in writing, I might say, came from the Leader of the National Party. It is all right him shaking his head, but I am giving him the credit where he deserves it. He wrote to me; it was he who wrote. The Leader of the Opposition, by contrast, put out a press release.</PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, I take much more seriously the approach of the Leader of the National Party, who actually wrote on this matter rather than conduct the matter by press release. I appreciate the constructive manner in which the Leader of the National Party approached this, and now that the Leader of the Opposition has raised the matter I concede that he is quite serious about this matter. We will have to take into account the important issue of timing, which I think those opposite will appreciate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member opposite does himself no good and certainly gives no support to the Leader of the National Party by his thoughtless interjection. As I was saying, it was a matter of timing. I note that the Leader of the National Party nodded in agreement, as well he might. The interests of those on the other side of the House are better served by the Leader of the National Party than by the thoughtless interjection of the honourable member opposite. It would be better if he kept quiet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the National Party has recognised, there is an important issue of timing. I do not say this in rejection of the proposition. I am simply saying, as the Leader of the National Party will agree, that there is an important issue of timing involved in this. It needs to be considered in detail to ensure that such a mission will have the maximum impact. As the Leader of the National Party is nodding his acquiescence, I am sure he agrees. If we are going to do this, it ought to have maximum impact. In particular, if we are going to have this mission it would need to be timed for when the export enhancement program was due to be considered by Congress and obviously when key players in the Congress were available.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying that I appreciate the sense in which the proposition has been put forward and I will give it serious consideration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Treasurer concerns the supervision of financial institutions. Is the Treasurer aware of remarks made today by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia detailing the bank's responsibilities in the prudential supervision of financial institutions? What are the Government's intentions in respect of the remarks of the Reserve Bank Governor?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="844" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My intentions are only to agree with him. The Governor of the Reserve Bank made some remarks, I might say very pointedly, to critics of the Reserve Bank supervisory regime and its supervision. I do not ascribe to the Reserve Bank Governor remarks pointed at the Opposition, though pointed they are. The Governor said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank supervisory role in relation to the banks has drawn some criticism recently. This has been ill-informed to the extent that it seeks to measure our supervisory performance in terms of the bad debt performance and losses of banks. That is to miss the main point, namely, that it is not the role of the Reserve Bank to stop banks from writing bad loans and suffering losses. Rather, the aim is to minimise the likelihood that such bad loans or losses will put a bank's viability or its depositors' funds at risk. The bank's primary concerns are to preserve the stability of the financial system as a whole and to protect, but not guarantee, bank deposits. The stability of the financial system is not in question and no bank depositor has lost any money.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The main responsibility for the prudent conduct of a bank's operations must rest with the board and management of that bank.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very damning indictment of the Opposition's criticisms. The Governor said:</PARA>
<PARA>This has been ill-informed to the extent that it seeks to measure our supervisory performance in terms of the bad debt performance and losses of banks.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this week the shadow Treasurer asked me to discipline the Reserve Bank for its supervisory role whereas the Governor says quite specifically that that view-that is, seeking me to discipline it-was ill-informed to the extent that it seeks to measure the supervisory performance of the bank in terms of bad debt performance and losses of other banks. In other words, it is the Governor politely putting down the Opposition's criticism, which is based falsely on the premise that bad debt performance and losses of a bank are the responsibility of the Reserve Bank, which he says is an ill-informed comment. He said that it misses the main point, and the main point is the point I have been making to the Opposition now repeatedly for days, namely, that it is not the role of the Reserve Bank to stop banks from writing bad loans. It cannot be the role of the Reserve Bank--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A straw man! Do not be so absurd. What an idiotic comment from the shadow Treasurer-`It is a straw man'. The Governor said that it is not the Reserve Bank's role to stop banks from writing bad loans. There are stacks of bad loans that have been written out there. The shadow Treasurer has tried to ascribe that as part of the Reserve Bank's responsibility, which clearly it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather, the aim is to minimise the likelihood, the Governor says, that such bad losses or loans will put a bank's viability or its depositors' funds at risk. That is the point I made yesterday: not one dollar of a depositor's deposit has been lost in the eight years this Government has been in office. That is the test of the system operating, and that is why the Governor makes it quite clear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The bank's primary concerns are to preserve the stability of the financial system as a whole and to protect, but not guarantee, bank deposits.</PARA>
<PARA>The stability of the financial system is not in question. No bank depositor has lost any money.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not think of a more pithy, more timely condemnation of the ill-founded criticism of the Opposition than that which is contained in this note.</PARA>

<PARA>State Banks have undertaken voluntarily to comply with the Bank's prudential requirements. For practical purposes the Bank's day-to-day supervision makes no distinction between State banks and Banking Act banks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never claimed that-never. The Governor goes on at pains to say why a State bank is not part-and the Prime Minister has marked it for me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank does not, however, have powers in respect of State banks that it could exercise if a Banking Act bank were in similar difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>In the latter case it could if necessary assume control of the bank and manage it in the interests of the depositors, perhaps pending a merger with another stronger bank.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, the banks and their owners have been prepared to face up to their property and other problem exposures and to take corrective action.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is clearly not a Banking Act bank. But I have always said that it has been informally supervised. To use the expression I have used: it has voluntarily complied with the Reserve Bank's liquidity guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Transport and Communications received a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) regarding a review of its coverage of the Gulf war in response to criticisms by Gerard Henderson and a number of other prominent Australians? Is the Minister satisfied with the outcome of the inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="845" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all honourable members would be delighted to learn that the result of that inquiry by the ABC into the question of bias in the ABC cleared the ABC of any substantial wrongdoing in regard to the issue of bias. There is to some extent a degree of legitimate levity around the chamber. May I point out, however, that there are one or two elements of that inquiry that did acknowledge that there were elements of the handling of the issues relating to the Gulf war which could have been done better, including one report-which was of very substantial concern to me-related to the alleged collision of an Australian warship in the Gulf that went through substantially unsubstantiated. I think it does have to be said that the ABC has provided a comprehensive and in many cases an excellent news coverage of the Gulf war, and we in our community have all benefited from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite evident that these sorts of studies, which are the only means that are currently to hand to investigate whether or not there is any wrongdoing, any bias or any inadequacy in ABC reporting, simply cannot keep continuing to be done by the ABC and no-one else. It does the ABC no good to have itself placed in that position. It is unique amongst Australian broadcasters in that regard. All other broadcasters-the public broadcasters as well as the commercial broadcasters-are obliged to submit themselves to an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) when a citizen or group of citizens raises a complaint as to bias. I think at the moment-I could be wrong-there is a Tribunal hearing going on in relation to standards in current affairs programs and commercial broadcasters. That situation ought not to persist for any substantial length of time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that the Government is currently considering what ought to be the means by which the ABC becomes more publicly accountable. There are basically two options. One option is to contemplate the establishment of an independent operation that directly considers these complaints as they come in. It would exist on its own account and would be the forum by which the ABC would be rendered accountable. In various forms that has some support among ABC senior management. Then there is the option of putting the ABC under the ABT like any other commercial broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will consider those two options. It seems to me that either would produce the situation that most would desire in terms of public accountability for the national broadcaster. We would expect to bring down a decision on that in the next month or two.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I also refer the Treasurer to the speech given by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia today in which he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If we were to become aware of a problem in a State bank, we would press the management and/or board to clarify the nature and extent of the difficulty and to put in place strategies to maintain the viability of the bank, protect its depositors and deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Treasurer yet determined whether the Reserve Bank made such inquiries and put in place such strategies with the State Bank of South Australia within the last 12 months? If not, why not?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="846" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I wish to say about this matter is what I said yesterday when referring to the Reserve Bank's relationship with any of the State banks. The Governor also mentioned it in his speech when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Banks owned by the State governments are not subject to the Banking Act since the Constitution precludes the Commonwealth from legislating over State banking.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank has no statutory power to supervise State banks although State banks have undertaken voluntarily to comply with the banks' prudential requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>Voluntary compliance is precisely the term that I have been using during the last week or so. If the Reserve Bank is aware of a problem the first thing it wishes to do is to have a bank comply with the liquidity ratios which other banks are required to observe, and to see that there is loss provisioning and that those loss provisions are adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the last time the bank had any contact with the State Bank of South Australia in terms of loss provisioning it had an idea of the asset quality which it has an idea of now. But the fact of the matter is that that accounting of the provisioning for losses coming from the collateral security of the loans and the asset quality backing them have come from the methodology employed by its owners through J.P. Morgan. It is on that basis that it believes that many of the loans will impact upon the capital of the bank to the tune of, from memory, $970m. The State Government has said that it will make that deficiency good, in which case the ratios again will be observed-more than observed-and the loss provisioning will be adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank can only enjoin bank boards to adequately provision for losses in these circumstances, but the accounting for those losses was undertaken by the management, by the Government. That occurred also in Victoria when the State Bank of Victoria approached the Government of Victoria, and the Premier of Victoria wrote to the Reserve Bank saying that the Government of Victoria would indemnify the State Bank for $500m, which it did, from memory, in late 1989 or early 1990. The same thing has happened with the State Bank of South Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Over the last several days reports have canvassed a health proposal which could eliminate Medicare and replace it with a private health insurance scheme to be supplemented by a voucher scheme for pensioners and the disadvantaged. Can the Minister inform the House of some of the consequences of such a change?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="847" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The proposal is the latest in a series of social policy and health ideas floated by the Leader of the Opposition in the last few months. The proposal, of course, must create doubt and uncertainty in the minds of all Australians, who, under Medicare, have unquestioned entitlement to health care regardless of their financial status or how old or sick they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed scheme, which appears to have been designed by the New Right think-tank called the Centre for Independent Studies, throws this entitlement to the wind. Indeed, the people of Australia will have no choice but to take out private insurance. Those who are deemed not to be able to afford their own insurance-namely, low income earners and pensioners-will be handed out government vouchers equal to the cost of basic health insurance. It seems that vouchers would be issued on the basis of some kind of sliding scale of disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members probably recall that in the last Parliament we heard a great deal about poverty traps from the Opposition; apparently the Opposition is considering creating what one might describe as the supreme poverty trap. What is emerging as the Opposition's intention is a somewhat insidious agenda-and I think this was confirmed by spokesmen in interviews this morning-firstly, to move towards fully privatised health services, including hospitals, and, secondly, to move towards the deregulation of the health insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these ambitions assume an environment of competition in the marketplace. It is obvious to any observer of the American health system, for example, that the dominance of market driven forces in that country during the 1980s certainly did not lead to any diminution of costs and may have lead to the escalation of costs. The United States, with a predominantly private system, is spending something of the order of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product on health, whereas Australia spends only 8.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The significant cost in any free market system is the overhead component of health insurance, that share which is diverted away from providers and hospitals to pay for administration of the paper flow. The administrative cost of private health insurance in Australia averages about 12.7 per cent. If we compare this with Medicare, we can see an extraordinary difference. In its 1989-90 annual report, the Health Insurance Commission reported that a little over 4 per cent was spent on administrative expenses. The reason for this marked difference is that under a universal scheme like Medicare everyone is eligible for equal benefits. No marketing is necessary, no-one has to be assessed against the risk of insuring himself or herself and no-one misses out; it is a universal scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Even worse than these cost problems, though, are inequities in the treatment of sick people, to which I referred yesterday. Once again, the poor and disadvantaged will have to become the recipients of a hand-out in the form of a voucher, which will only pay for basic health insurance. In what is expected to be a predominantly private system, basic cover will not be adequate for a comprehensive range of services. On any sliding scale, as I have suggested, the creation of a poverty trap is unavoidable.</PARA>
<PARA> One might ask what will happen to those in the older age group who are still earning and suffer an illness. There will not be any voucher for them. They will have to rely on the private market. Again one must ask a question about the effect of the replacement of the community rating system in which everyone pays the same rate with a risk rating system, whereby those who are unfortunate enough to be sick will be forced to pay either through higher insurance or out of their own pocket if their risk prohibits insurance cover.</PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that the Opposition would take a scheme which is supported by 71 per cent of the Australian population, a scheme which supports a hospital system in which 85 per cent of recent users claim satisfaction with the treatment that they are receiving, and in fact dump it for an untested New Right think-tank idea of vouchers which effectively would free up-not restrain-costs in terms of the Australian health system. According to sources, the Opposition is not suggesting less expenditure in terms of health, but somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion of additional expenditure to ensure those who are most disadvantaged, chronically ill or most at risk do not have the certainty of universal health insurance and of the current system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Yesterday he attacked the coalition for canvassing a range of options for changes to our health system which may improve its efficiency and fairness, and he repeated that attack again today. Yet, in a wonderful display of characteristic hypocrisy today, he admitted on radio that the Medicare system has encouraged a pattern of overuse in health services at a rate that is above most other Western countries. I ask the Minister whether it is true that the Medicare system is underfunded by the Medicare levy to the tune of billions of dollars. Is this the reason why today he admitted that the system is unable to meet the demand imposed on it, leading to waiting lists and other rationing devices which impede access to health care, particularly for those on low incomes?

There are assumptions involved in the question which, of course, I have to reject. We have debated in this country the question of health insurance for almost 60 years. The 1980s has been the first decade in which not only have we had in place a universal health insurance system, but also we have had a system which has overwhelmingly won the support of the Australian population. From less than 50 per cent of the population, something like three-quarters of the Australian population now support the system that was instituted in the 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Of course, this sticks in the craw of an Opposition which is ultimately about limited and vested interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, Mr Speaker, what this Opposition is about is restoring something like paid private health insurance-as if insurance has something to do with the second issue raised by the honourable member in terms of the whole question of overservicing. The fact of the matter is, whether it is private insurance or public insurance, that the question of overservicing will not be affected. Of course, one has to deal with that issue of overservicing, but one has to deal with the issue not in terms of the fundamentals-which are essentially sound and which are essentially supported by the Australian public. As a government, we have been concerned primarily to ensure not only stability in terms of health insurance and restraint of costs but also equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, this morning the honourable member for Lowe was asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>Are you able to guarantee that no Australian will be financially worse off under an Opposition, or a Coalition Government health policy?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>What we'd like to do is, if people are worse off, they're worse off by choice.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has sought to manage an equitable approach to health insurance policy. It has been successful, it has been stable and it has resulted in the restraint of costs. What the Opposition would seek to do is go back to the dark ages when those who were most disadvantaged found themselves without insurance, bearing the costs of their health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget is providing automatic support to cushion the recession and helps protect those most vulnerable. That is coming by way of lower tax receipts and higher outlays which, as I say, is cushioning the recession as the savings of the Commonwealth decline but as the savings of the private sector naturally increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fiscal policy under this Government is set in the longer term, that is, a longer term framework where in a stronger economy the surplus continues to grow because the structural grip on outlays is now quite profound after years of outlays management by this Government and where, as I say, lower Commonwealth savings now are offset by higher cyclical savings by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> So the idea that we should now cut $3 billion from outlays, which is the proposition put forward by the shadow Treasurer, would be pro-cyclical and would absolutely tear the guts out of the economy, which is what he would intend. The fact is that the Government will not be taking action to offset the cycle; it will keep the tone on outlays but we will not be trying to find $3 billion. Part of that $3 billion is a reduction in unemployment benefits for someone after nine months. The shadow Treasurer says:</PARA>
<PARA>They ought to cut out unemployment benefits after nine months in accordance with the propositions of the economic action plan of a year or two ago.</PARA>
<PARA>A questioner then put to him:</PARA>
<PARA>But at a time of increasing unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer was, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>We ought to be operating our economy much more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA> So after nine months-and this is from this Opposition, which is now bleating about the impact of recession upon employment and the unemployed-they are out. The only way we can save $1,500m is by knocking off the special benefit. So the notion that they go out and then pick up the special benefit is out. They go out on the streets after nine months and they carry a $1.5 billion burden. That is how the shadow Treasurer would meet part of the $3 billion reduction in Commonwealth outlays. Why would he want to cut Commonwealth outlays now by $3 billion with the economy in the cycle it is in? Only a mindless person like him would suggest that-and only a party like his, which has no concern for the population at large, would propose such a thing.</PARA>
<PARA> Then he went on to say that he wished to scrap the accord. So at a time when the accord is holding back wage increases-we have just taken out 0.7 per cent in the December quarter; it has not been paid at all in the March quarter-he would prefer Australian employers to be now finding that 0.7 per cent in their wage and salary bills under his policy; under our policy, they do not have to find it. But he would then leave inflation controls to the so-called independent Reserve Bank of Australia, which he would make more independent-although he asked me yesterday about it disciplining banks-and which should then apparently rely upon monetary policy and burn out what life is left in the economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first two questions is yes. In terms of the allegations going around as to the reason for nervousness and desertion of the market by buyers through January, I think there are four versions around and they are all based on good bush legend and myth. One version was that it was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie; another was the fact that in the good week the Australian Wool Corporation put some extra wool on the market; another one was that Mrs Davletova did not come out leading a Russian mission; and the fourth one was the allegations concerning the Vines committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put those allegations to the Vines committee and the members of that committee said, of course, in terms of their questions and discussions with people in Europe, a whole range of questions and hypothetical propositions came up and, on the specific allegation that they were supposedly canvassing 500c, they simply said that this came up in conversation and discussion.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="854" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The national project on the quality of teaching and learning was launched today. For the first time in Australia's history all the employers of teachers in Australia and all the representatives of those teachers are sitting down in the same room addressing the fundamental question of how we can improve the quality of the Australian school system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people will try to look beyond the questions of constitutional divisions and financial restraints to how we can deal with some of those questions which have been in the too hard basket for too long. This provides an opportunity to take us back to the central purposes of education: quality-the quality that we can provide for our children's education-and equality, that is, ensuring that all children, regardless of their parental or social circumstances, have an equal chance to explore the full capacity of their talents.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important in this context to remember that the Commonwealth's funding role is but a supplementary one. We supplement the activities of the States and the private school system. The way in which we do that is by providing support to schools in accordance with their needs: the schools which have the greatest need for support receive the greatest support. The Government's funding in the next eight-year period will contribute to every school in Australia being lifted to a minimum standard.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has trotted out a proposal which is a travesty of an idea. It is supposed to be an idea but it is merely a travesty of an idea. It ignores the schools, goes past the schools, and tries to propose that we provide vouchers to parents on some unspecified basis. Once again, this proposal invites many more questions than it answers. For instance, in the first place, it is inevitable that such a proposal would lead to the imposition of fees in the government school system. That system, which at the moment is without fees, would have fees imposed upon it in order that a voucher system could work for those 75 per cent of parents who send their children to government schools. It would also lead to the withdrawal of funding from the private schools and its replacement with some parent based voucher. That means that fees must go up by up to $2,000 a year in order to compensate for the withdrawal--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite may not understand the implications of their own policies. They may not understand this, but the fees must go up by up to $2,000 to compensate for the withdrawal of funding which currently goes to the schools. Worst of all, most funds would be withdrawn from the most needy schools; therefore, the fees hike would be greatest in the most needy schools. To take the example of the Catholic school system, fees in secondary schools would go up by up to $1,800 a year and in primary schools by up to $1,200 a year. This is the inescapable consequence of any policy which is designed to remove funding from the school and direct it to a voucher system. It is even worse than that--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Commonwealth funds that we now provide were divided equally across all school children, there would be $800 per child available for such a voucher system. That means that if the voucher was going to be equally based, then those who were now receiving most would receive much less; those who were in the elite private schools would receive much more than they are receiving now. It is a totally unfair and unequal proposition unless, of course, there is going to be a system of differential vouchers which would involve an army of bureaucracy in order to administer it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most importantly, this would remove the essential funding security which we have provided to the Australian school system. This is not much of an idea. It is not even a new idea; it has been around for 30 years. It has been considered in the United States, the United Kingdom and, more recently, New Zealand, and it has been rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition referred us to the work of the Centre for Independent Studies, so I turned it up, and what did it say? It said:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words the idea of educational vouchers has been [so to speak] ``for sale'' since 1962, and no-one appears to have bought it.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not only an old idea; it is a shop soiled idea. Nobody wants it, yet now the Opposition is pretending to recycle it.</PARA>
<PARA> This is just another example of the Leader of the Opposition going around throwing out these ideas-ill-considered, ill thought through-unprepared to answer the hard questions about how they are going to work. We have seen it in relation to social security policy, in relation to health policy and in relation to taxation policy.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Leader of the Opposition is rapidly becoming known as in Australia is `Half-baked Hewson'-he comes up with these half-baked ideas, ill-considered, ill thought through but, worse than that, he does not have the guts to answer the questions which come from these ideas or these proposals that he floats. It is rather reminiscent of the cartoon character who has an idea and a light globe appears above his head. But there is no brilliant illumination coming from the Leader of the Opposition-just a flickering, dim globe close to fade-out. That is the nature of the proposals which have come from the Leader of the Opposition. The people of Australia deserve better from their politicians than this kind of behaviour.</PARA>

We have had the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for Bruce, and now we have a couple more who will have a go. We have had half a cricket team of people trying to come up with policies in the area of employment, education and training, and yet each and every one of them trails in our wake as we go about the business of providing better opportunities for Australian children and Australian people who are desirous of getting into and staying in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic under discussion today is the voucher system for medical insurance which has been proposed by the Opposition. What we have once again from the Opposition is poor policy making, yesterday's solutions, policy that has not been thought through and the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), once again making policy on the run, throwing ideas around and leaving the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), to defend his position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solution proposed by the shadow spokesman on the other side of the House is a seminar in which `we are going to return to Thredbo and we are going to sit around brainstorming and we will come up with a policy'. One of the Opposition's best and favoured prescriptions is the voucher system. </PARA>
<PARA> Who do we have on the brains trust? Who do we have as part of the policy group in the Opposition? We have a trio of former failed shadow Ministers. We have the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) who is, I must say, a thoughtful man. He came up with some good ideas when he was shadow spokesman but unfortunately every time the leadership changed he found it impossible to get a leader who would accept his views. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mackellar was followed by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who came up with a policy. He had a couple of tries. His policy failed basically because, as he admitted himself, it meant that the wealthy and the well would have to pay more. That, of course, was unacceptable for the Liberal Party. Indeed, he now languishes on the back bench. Some have said that the reason for this is that he did not go to the right school. Others have suggested that it is because he does not talk properly. We know that the reason he is on the back bench is because of his failed health policy which was unacceptable to the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Then along came the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). He had a policy, or so he said; he told us he had a policy. We waited and we waited and then, in February of last year, he assured our re-election by advocating maintaining Medicare and, of course, fiddling with the edges. Now we find the honourable member for Lowe grappling with the same problem. </PARA>
<PARA> After eight years the Opposition is still unable to throw off the ideological baggage. It is still unable to say that Medicare is popular and it has been successful. We are not denying that there are some problems with Medicare. We are suggesting that in ethos, in efficiency, in fairness and in quality and access in the real world Medicare has delivered the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members do not have to take my word for it. Allow me to quote from Professor Stuart Altman, a health economist and adviser to Congress in the Reagan Administration, hardly a purveyor of Labor Party philosophy. When he was talking about health care policy after investigating our system in Australia he said that the problem in the United States had been that they were unwilling to make difficult decisions about health care and were unwilling to make political decisions which maintained and contained costs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you want an exciting, well-functioning health care system stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have, and that is why we should stay here. Why on earth would people want to change a system that works, is popular and is efficient? Would somebody do it if it was unfair? If it was unfair, I think that, yes, somebody would look at it. But we have a basic community rating principle which says that the burden of health care is shared by the whole community. That is something that provides for universal coverage, coverage of all. In today's Herald-Sun, an article by Sue Dunlevy stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Liberal opponents of the scheme said it could also leave many people without health insurance . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those Liberal opponents, of course, are members of the health policy committee of the Opposition; they are uncertain about the effects of this scheme and they are concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a fair system, but it must be unpopular, because the Opposition wants to change it. But the Health Insurance Commission's most recent survey showed that Medicare is unprecedentedly popular. As many as 71 per cent of those surveyed who have used Medicare suggest that they are very satisfied with the service they have been getting. Opposition to Medicare is at an all time low. Only 22 per cent of the population oppose it and even amongst those with private health insurance, 60 per cent of people support Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> So we find that Medicare is something that is popular. It is popular because people find it affordable, they understand it and they know how it works. This is especially so for people who have had use of the service. As the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) mentioned in Question Time today, 85 per cent of people who have used the service support it and believe that the system has served them well. </PARA>
<PARA> So why is the Opposition wanting to change the system? It must be that it considers the system to be inefficient. But if we look at the efficiency of the system, we find overwhelmingly that the Health Insurance Commission's costs for administration are about a third of those of private health funds. It is an efficient system; it is efficient for those who are providers and it is efficient for patients who want to be paid. It is efficient in every way. The efficiency of the system is beyond question, and the Opposition does not question that. The Opposition must have some belief that there is in the market a better way of doing it. But-and it is important that people understand this-once there is health insurance for providing health care, there is no longer a perfect market. As long as that is the case, it needs to be understood that efficiency cannot be determined in that way. The Opposition is advocating not the absence of health insurance but that everybody takes out private health insurance. As soon and as long as we have that in the health system, we no longer have a perfect market. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that it is not the consumers who make all the choices when it comes to spending in health care; providers make all the choices. All of the costs that are involved in providing medical services are a result of decisions made by providers. It is important that that be understood. Even Adam Smith, when he talked about his perfect market, said that what is necessary to have a perfect market is perfect knowledge. There is no way in which consumers understand or can know what a good doctor is and what an appropriate service is, so in this area of health care it is not the case that the market can operate in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps overseas experience indicates that the system is more efficient where the market operates. As I have already indicated, there is a huge indictment of what happens in the United States by medical professionals and by any objective observer. Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States said:</PARA>
<PARA>Although American medical skill is amongst the best in the world we have an abominable system of delivery of health care-gross inequities towards the poor, particularly the working poor, and profiteering by many hospitals and some medical doctors who prey on the vulnerability of the ill. </PARA>
<PARA>The United States has an inefficient system. It spends nearly 12 per cent of gross domestic product on delivering health care-we spent 8.1 per cent in this country-and the service does not provide universal coverage, fairness or equity. The commonest cause of bankruptcy in the United States is ill health. Some 37 million people in the United States have no health insurance cover. When one looks at the costs of delivering health care in that country, one cannot suggest for a moment that the free market, as it operates there-unfettered medical entrepreneurship as it operates there-is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> One would say, `Okay, we need to cut costs; we understand that. Maybe we should look at another system'. Maybe we should look at the proposals pursued by the Thatcher Government. In the United Kingdom the national health scheme has been held intact by the Thatcher Government. Among all the other changes that have been brought into the system in that country, the national health scheme has been held intact. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently it decided to review the scheme with a view to privatisation and change, but the conclusion of an all-party social services committee was that there would be no benefits. We find in the United Kingdom the rationing of services beyond anything that we can understand in this country. If a person is over the age of 55, he is not eligible for dialysis in the United Kingdom. If he is over the age of 65, he can forget about his hip transplant because that is not a possibility. That is the sort of rationing that is necessary in other countries to contain costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand that there are difficulties in providing a service for everybody. It is possible and feasible to provide a fantastic service that covers everyone in the country, but what is the cost-another $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 billion? If Opposition members are willing to make that sort of allocation, they should stand up and say so and not float proposals such as this, which will effectively change the way in which health care is delivered, making it something which the wealthy and the well will get more easily while the sick have to pay more. That is what is being advocated by the Opposition in this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Families and individuals will receive vouchers to put towards the cost of private health insurance. They will get basic private health insurance for their vouchers. What will be the premium? We do not know. What will be basic cover? We do not know. But we understand that that is how it will operate. If it is to operate in that way, there can no longer be a community rating principle applied. </PARA>
<PARA> A 50-year-old working man, who obviously is in a higher risk category than a 20-year-old, will have a much higher premium because the voucher system will not operate once he earns above a particular amount. An 80-year-old pensioner would be covered completely by the voucher system, but that cover would be funded by the Government. The cost to the Government is going to be massive because the risk premium on an 80-year-old pensioner is huge. For an 80-year-old person who just falls outside the pension system-and many of these people are not wealthy-the premium would be sky high. </PARA>
<PARA> How on earth can there be any equity in the system? If the community rating principle is removed, the well and wealthy will be better off and the sick will have to pay more. It is against this principle that we will fight. We hope that the Opposition will go to the next election carrying such a proposal. Let us look at the total costs. The Opposition must be pursuing this policy because of a saving, but a quote from the Herald-Sun reveals the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Opposition sources yesterday disclosed early estimates by the party had shown the voucher health insurance system could add to federal health costs by as much as $1 billion, which would threaten Dr Hewson's stated aim of cutting government spending. </PARA>
<PARA>We have here a policy which is supposed to be better for everybody, which is going to cost more and yet which is consistent with saving money. We cannot find any rationale for that. We find that those people who are unsure of their health-the sick, the aged or those who are presently supported by the system which covers them-will have uncertainty. For those who are wealthy, well off, and can afford to pay there will be a better situation. There will be increases in numbers of people uninsured. Opponents of the system in the Opposition have already indicated their concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We will find no control over the price of services, unfettered entrepreneurial activity in the medical area and something else that the Opposition has been suggesting for a while-that is, the removal of health care into the social security area. That might be possible because social security is going to be doled out by Touche Ross and Co. or by the soup kitchen, according to the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not suggesting that Medicare is perfect; we never have. I have stood up in this place many times and suggested ways in which we could improve it. Incentives need to be provided for preventative health care and for doctors to see patients less. Indeed, the use of day surgery and other changes are important. But we do not need to let loose the endless agenda of the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> As the former Senator Peter Baume said, health care delivery has only a marginal effect on health outcome. So many other factors are important-diet, lifestyle, poverty, education, housing, welfare, employment and child-care. All of these things are important determinants of health in the population in general. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is pursuing, and what this Minister is pursuing, is a national health strategy which integrates all of those things. That is a sensible solution to add to a system that works effectively now. We have a system which is by any measure efficient. It is popular in an unprecedented way. It is fair, it is simple and it is accepted and understood by people. It is sheer lunacy for us in this place to consider returning to an unfair system-one with uncertainties in it, one that is more costly and one that is really born of ideological fantasy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very pleased to address this matter of public importance today which has been raised by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), although I notice that he does not have the guts to stand up and speak first. He is also known as the Minister for hypocrisy. He comes here to this House, fresh from his resounding failure in the social security portfolio, where the only worthwhile thing he managed to achieve was to get someone else-Bettina Cass-to tell him what he should do with his department. He was totally incapable of running a worthwhile department then-and the only thing he could do was come to this dispatch box, splutter all over us, throw books at press conferences and throw tantrums. He was incapable of making any constructive changes in that portfolio and clearly the same problem will arise in this portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister himself said, he was pushed into this portfolio against his better judgment. I believe his first comments were that he did not know much about health. Clearly, the fact that he has put himself down as the second speaker today indicates that he still does not know much about health. Perhaps he might like to take some lessons from some of the other members here. What did the Minister do when he came to this portfolio? He actually said that he would wash his hands of the issue and he would appoint another review-he would do his Pontius Pilate act. I will come back to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine Medicare and see how good Medicare really is. Does it really live up to the dogma of the Australian Labor Party? The first question to ask is: if it is so good, why on earth is the Government spending $2.2m of taxpayers' money on a review to try to fix it up? If, as the Minister and his predecessors have said so many times, Medicare is God's gift to mankind, why do we need to resolve so many of the problems with it? There are problems and let us look at some of those problems. What about underfunding? I asked the Minister a question about underfunding and I noticed that he managed signally not to answer that question; he talked about everything else under the sun, but he did not give any reasonable answer to the question of underfunding. I have a quote which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The decay in capital infrastructure resulting from a severe shortfall in capital investment, particularly in the public hospital system, threatens to impair the standard of service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA>Who said this? Did it come from some right wing think tank? No, it was our beloved Minister for Community Services and Health. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Public hospital capital expenditure which was running at 7 and 8 per cent of recurrent costs through the 1960s and early 1970s declined to 3 per cent by the eighties. Since then capital expenditure on public hospitals has not been much greater than private hospitals, although public hospitals represent 75 per cent of all stock. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Minister for Health himself talking about underfunding. It is no wonder he did not want to answer the question today. There is only one reason why the system is underfunded. It is because the Minister does not give it the funds-it is entirely his responsibility. The level of capital expenditure on hospitals in Australia is appalling. The Minister can try to devolve responsibility, as he does regularly, to the States, but the reality is that the funds for capital expenditure are not granted by the States; at present they are a Federal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just capital expenditure which has suffered either. The other area which has suffered enormously is the private sphere. We have had a change from the days prior to Medicare when approximately 70 per cent of the population were insured to a level now where 45 per cent of the population are insured. Why is that so? The answer is a number of reasons. Firstly, it is because the Government has withdrawn subsidies to the private industry to the tune of some $450m. It has withdrawn moneys via the gap charges, bed day subsidies and contributions to the reinsurance pool. Those moneys equate to a total increase in the average health premium of $150 per year. So $150 comes out of individuals' pockets because of the Government's decisions about private health funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that there are a number of problems in the private health industry. It is no wonder that health insurance is less attractive, and as time goes on fewer and fewer people are insured. The ones that are left are those who are sick and, therefore, more expensive to the private industry and to the health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem, of course, is that a number of the health funds and a number of private hospitals in Australia are facing enormous financial difficulties. Some of them will go down the chute. At this stage there is a long list of funds not meeting their obligations. What is the Government doing about it? It is doing nothing. It is absolutely vital that we have a healthy private industry and that this be allowed to compete with any public sphere. If there is no competition, there is no increase in incentives and no incentives for efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at another quote from the Minister's predecessor:</PARA>
<PARA> In the last year of the Liberal health scheme, 1983, there were 7.70 services per enrolled population; in 1986 . . . there were 7.68 per enrolled population . . . but there has been no change in the pattern of servicing of patients under Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, this morning the Minister said, and I believe will again say on Thursday, that the system is overused-and there is no doubt about that. Let us look at a few figures. Let us look at the medical items that are rebated. In 1984, the first year of Medicare, the number of medical items rebated-that is, general practitioner (GP) consultations, operations, X-rays and pathology services-totalled $110m. Since then, we have had bulkbilling and there have been very few changes to the whole system. Yet, in 1988, in spite of bulkbilling being the only change, the number of items rebated had increased from $110m to $144m. Certainly, they were going up beforehand, but that is an exponential rise. The reason for it is largely bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA> A few weeks ago I was talking to a general practitioner about over-servicing and bulk billing. I asked whether there was an association and why we did not think about modifying the bulkbilling procedures. The answer that he, as a GP who bulkbills all the time, gave me was that when it is raining gold nuggets from heaven, you do not worry about where they are coming from, you bend down and pick them up. That is the Government's bulkbilling!</PARA>
<PARA> There is hypocrisy in here in enormous fashion. Let us look at the details of the last Budget. In the last Budget the Government announced there was too much usage of a number of pharmaceuticals, especially by pensioner groups; therefore it would impose a charge on those pensioners. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) actually uttered words to the effect that if one did not charge a fee for a service, of course it would be overused. I agree with that absolutely and entirely, and I am sure my colleagues here do. There has to be a price signal in there. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is right for the Government to issue a price signal for pharmaceuticals, why is it not right for the Government to issue a price signal for medical items? If the Government were consistent, it would say, `We are going to charge $2.50 for every pharmaceutical item and we will charge, say, $2.50 for any visit to the doctor'. It has not done that. It is just pure hypocrisy for the Government to have a diversified approach such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that on Thursday the Minister will release a report from the Macklin Committee. One of the issues in that is over-servicing by GPs. I understand the Government will say that the main problem with over-servicing is in the GP area. If the reports emanating out of the Minister's office are accurate, he will say that we need to change the question of fee-for-service for GPs into some other system. What will he do? He will not put on a capitation fee. He will not go the United Kingdom way; he has just said how bad it is. Presumably he will not go into the question of salaried GPs. I think that would be out of the question even for the Minister. I do not think that is really an option. Presumably he will move the health maintenance organisation way. HMO is when one decides to pay a doctor a certain amount to look after one's health care for a year. If one is not sick, of course, the doctor makes a profit; if one is very sick, the doctor makes a loss. So there are incentives there for doctors to cut costs-and, of course, to cut corners. It means that there is a more limited service available to those individuals in that system. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the ways in which costs are constrained overseas has been to use HMOs. The system is very effective. But they have to be used in competition with a higher cost private system. If people are not saving money in one system as compared with another, no-one will want a worse service. One has to have a private system which is viable and active at the same time. Sadly, this Government is doing its best to destroy the privately based system. It is basically saying that everybody has to be under the Government from cradle to grave. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning on a radio interview the Minister raised the question of rationing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I think what you're talking about really is rationing-</PARA>
<PARA>this is about our range of proposals-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . like petrol rationing after the war. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is another quote from a news release:</PARA>
<PARA> Resources are limited, and rationing is unavoidable. </PARA>
<PARA>And the news release comes from?-Brian Howe, Minister for Community Services and Health. It is dated 12 December; it is not an outdated policy. The heading reads `Howe : Health Resources Must Be Rationed'. Talk about hypocrisy! He sits there with a straight face; he should hang his head in shame. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has rationed the funds available to hospitals so that hospitals all around the country have a waiting list for people, particularly those waiting for elective surgery and especially for orthopaedic procedures and ophthalmic surgery-the things that affect the elderly in particular. The Minister is not quite in that age group yet, but he is getting there. I would look after it if I were him. He has done this in a very heartless fashion. Those people are the ones the Minister is supposed to be protecting; the Medicare system is supposed to look after the elderly and the underprivileged. They are the ones who are suffering. The rich and the fit can get by; they can actually go into private health funds because they have the money and they can bypass the queues. The people who suffer are the elderly and the disadvantaged, and they are the ones in particular who are faced with those problems. But the Minister does not worry about trivial details like that; he is just worried about saving a bit more money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister made some amazing comments about the voucher system. Let me say categorically that the Opposition is not espousing a voucher system; we are looking at a range of options of which that is one. We will have a range of discussions within and without the Party and reach a conclusion. The whole aim will be to reach a health system which has quality of care, which has good access to that care, which gives good, efficient delivery, and which is simple to understand. Quality, access and efficiency are the three things we should aim at, and three things which Medicare, sadly, does not have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's idea of a voucher system was that people would get a voucher for a hip replacement, for a touch of pneumonia or for a quick pregnancy. The mind boggles that somebody could imagine such a system. The problem is, of course, that the patients who are suffering, waiting for their elective surgery, are cast aside by this Government. It says, `They only need elective surgery. What is elective surgery?'. Elective surgery is serious. It includes things like hip replacements. People have their hips replaced because they are in pain and cannot walk. It is no wonder that people want their hips replaced, yet the Government makes them wait up to 18 months. What about cataracts? People have their cataracts fixed because without getting them fixed they are blind. The Government does not care whether people are blind and are on waiting lists for months on end. There is no compassion at all. There is pain involved in elective surgery and it is crucial that the whole thing is fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of the Minister is astounding in terms of accusing us in regard to this proposal when in fact what we are doing is reviewing the system and looking at a range of options. What is the Government doing? It has instituted the Macklin review to look at a range of options. The difference, of course, is that the Government's review cost the taxpayers $2.2m and ours is free. We will give the Government the benefit of our advice whenever it wants it. There is no problem at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that the Macklin review has been set up in this way, but I guess that, because the Cass Review of Social Security took the heat off the Minister in his previous portfolio, it is not surprising that he is doing the same thing. He is passing the buck to see whether somebody else can make the proposals and take the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get stuck into Miss Macklin, but I must say that we were all amazed that she was appointed. What are her credentials? Is she a well-known health economist? No. Is she involved in hospital administration? Does she have medical or nursing expertise? No. Her only credential is that she worked for a Labor Minister in Victoria. She did a good job; she looked after him and kept him out of trouble. I suppose the Minister is hoping that she will keep him out of trouble, too. The way he is going, I do not think he is going to be kept out of trouble. These people should have impartial views, not just run their particular bent according to their riding instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of issues covered by this portfolio. I will touch on one of them. There are some really heart-rending tales about which I despair. One which is currently in the arena-and about which I have contacted the Minister's office, I think it is fair to say, at least a dozen times in the last two weeks, and he would not disagree with that-is Allowah Babies Hospital. Allowah Babies Hospital in Sydney looks after disabled kids, and they are grossly disabled. Most of them have cerebral palsy, there are spastic kids and most of them cannot even lift their heads off a chair. At Allowah Babies Hospital they are given the most intensive therapy one could imagine. They are looked after minute by minute. They are given intensive physiotherapy and stimulation. The hospital makes those kids into something approaching healthy human beings. What happens if the kids do not get that therapy? According to this Minister they should stay in nursing homes, lie on their backs, vegetate, get bed sores and eventually die of pneumonia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is this Government's approach. It has done it by introducing the acute care certification-and I will not go into the details of that. The Minister has no heart and no compassion. When the heat was on a few months ago he promised to fix one of those babies-just one. There are another 40 of them in that hospital-and he has not fixed the one, let alone the 40. He did that just to take the heat off himself. That hospital is under threat of closure because of this Minister. Those babies will be put into nursing homes to vegetate because the Minister does not care about them. </PARA>
<PARA> What about Lesley Milne? Lesley Milne is a young lady who has renal failure. All she wanted was to grow up and see her child grow up. She has a child named Brook, who is about 10 years old now. She had renal failure and she needed a drug called erythropoietin, which basically would have meant the difference between life and death for her. It took us on this side of the House to organise funding for that drug because this Minister said, and has only recently changed the decision, that erythropoietin should not be available-`It is too expensive. Don't worry about the fact it saves lives or allows mothers to see their children grow up. It is too expensive. We will make sure that it is blocked out'. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it going to be blocked out? As Minister Staples said the other day, it is because the drug companies supplying information did not meet certain criteria. The information they did not supply was not asked for until 2 1/2 years after it was first asked for approval. The information asked for was: is the drug sterile? Is any drug ever sterile? Can honourable members believe that!</PARA>
<PARA> There is no compassion with this Minister. The Medicare system is falling down about his ears and there are a whole range of systems that need to be attacked-that need to be fixed. We have no particular bias against Medicare as such. We are happy to look at the whole issue, to look at a range of problems, and we will come to a solution which gives quality of care, access to that care and efficient delivery of that care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that is the subject of the matter of public importance which the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) perhaps would liked to have forgotten is the uncertainty caused to all Australians by the Opposition's proposal to abolish Medicare and replace it with a voucher system of medical insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand the nervousness of the honourable member for Lowe, because he knows that 71 per cent of Australians support the Medicare system. He knows that the basic principles of Medicare-free universal health insurance, equity and the efficiency of the system-have been recognised by Australians. He also knows that Medicare has been a fact in Australia since 1983 and that rather than cause a blow-out in health costs, Medicare has stabilised those costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared for example to the United States, which has a much more private sector orientated health care system which costs something like 12 per cent of gross domestic product, Medicare in Australia costs approximately 8 per cent of GDP. So the system has worked, it has been popular and it has provided a basis for funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare levy was never intended to fully cover all health costs in Australia. Indeed, no health insurance scheme has ever done that and Medicare does not seek to do it, either. Australia's health care system on the whole has been very effective and has received a great deal of support from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has begun to float policy proposals, which has led to a great deal of politicking among Opposition members. After all, membership of the Opposition committee concerned with developing alternative health policies is composed of former spokespersons and former Ministers who have very different approaches. For example, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) would like to reinstate the scheme for which he was responsible but which turned out to be very, very difficult to cost and which blew up on the eve of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) is a failed Minister for Health but is someone who would pretend to propose radical alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mackellar is the supremo in terms of the whole area of social policy, but he always fails to articulate his views in the House on social policy. However, he has been put in that position, and we all know that the honourable member has what might be regarded as quite radical views. We are not opposed to people having radical or even reactionary views, but if they have such views they ought to be prepared to espouse them and debate them in Parliament. The Opposition's committee floated the idea of private insurance health vouchers. That idea was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to float last week, and he walked into Parliament knowing that the issue is a very divisive one within his own party but failed to follow up the speech in which he floated this idea. In fact he downgraded the issue because it was not really a policy but an idea which he wanted to mention and which he did not expect anyone to take seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that members of the Opposition have to learn that when they have ideas, they will be taken seriously by the Government-because the task of governing this country is too important to allow oneself to be led into a situation where, in an election campaign atmosphere, one finds that one's whole proposition has been blown apart. There they were, members of the Opposition, only months ago facing an election with a policy scheme in mind which in fact blew apart within weeks of the election itself, and which they were effectively walking away from as they were running in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a scheme which is working, which is effective and which is supported by the Australian population, why would we want to replace it with an untested scheme which effectively has been developed by a right wing think-tank and which essentially does not appear to be particularly relevant to the problems that face the Australian health care system? Mr Speaker, I will tell you why some people might do that: because essentially they recognise that an approach that favours private health insurance, a scheme or an approach which effectively underwrites the cost of health in terms of the private sector-and ultimately which underwrites the incomes of doctors-is one that, in terms of the sectional interests that are so important to their parties, would curry a great deal of favour and, indeed, would be very popular. </PARA>
<PARA> That is essentially the problem of the conservative party-they are conservative in the sense not only that they have conservative ideology, but also that they are essentially-(Quorum formed) Essentially, the motive as far as the Opposition is concerned is a sectional motive. It is a motive which would destroy a public system of health insurance and replace it with emphasis on the private sector. As the honourable member for Lowe said this morning as he talked about the merits of the approach, he would allow them to take out private insurance, to take the voucher around to a number of health funds and choose the health insurance of their choice. That is, rather than a system that guarantees people access to the health care system, he wants to put people in the situation where they are choosing between health insurance funds, choosing between the inefficiency, the 12 per cent of their revenue spent on administration, as opposed to the 4 per cent; and he wants to have them going around looking at all the tables. He wants to get them confused, to get them out of the situation where they have any real security-because security is not one of the issues he is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe says, `Well, of course, Medicare itself is an option; that is something that we want to retain'. He says, `Let's try to fix up some of the problems of Medicare and encourage people to take out private insurance by implementing a range of financial incentives'. That is, he is saying, `Okay, look, we want to say Medicare is all right because we know that people think it is all right, but let's spend some money to provide incentives for people to get into health insurance'. Finally he says, `I think if you look at Logan's proposal and you give compensation to a significant number of people in terms of giving vouchers to those people, it certainly would cost more and how much it would cost would depend on who you gave the vouchers to'. That is, rather than restraining costs, what he is about is expanding the costs of the health system. </PARA>
<PARA> What does that mean? It ultimately means giving more money to doctors, more money to professionals and more money to those people who already do very well out of the health care system. Do not worry about the Australian people; do not worry about our aged; do not worry about our chronically ill; do not worry about our people with disabilities-essentially this is about distributing money to those who are wealthy and not concerning ourselves with equity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this matter of public importance were not so serious, it would be an absolute joke. The joke is that the Government seeks to mask its own policy failures in the health portfolio by bringing on this matter in the personage of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). Obviously Government strategists have got together and decided that some form of attack is at least the best form of defence. They know-certainly the previous Minister for Health, now the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) knows, and I think it is slowly dawning on the current Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe)-that the serious deficiencies in the health portfolio under their administration are absolutely indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For as long as the Government fails to face up to the problems that beset Medicare, this health debate will be a very serious debate indeed. For as long as the Government fails to face up to its responsibilities, for as long as it fails to recognise the problems and set about intelligently and intellectually-something the current Minister prides himself on-facing up to those problems and trying to solve them, we are going to have thousands of Australians who are locked out of our public hospitals and denied the care and treatment where and when they need it. We are going to have tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australians continuing to languish in those queues in pain and suffering, and in many cases dying before they even get between the sheets. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant thing the honourable member for Perth said in his contribution was this: Medicare is not perfect. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tell you something-it is not perfect by a long shot. Nevertheless, as the Minister begins falteringly to come to grips with his responsibility, I perceive that he is starting to recognise some of its imperfections, because he himself has put on the agenda for debate the fact that Medicare is underfunded. It is grossly underfunded. Medicare has never raised more than a third of total Commonwealth medical and hospital outlays-never. It is underfunded in that sense, and the majority of the money comes out of other taxes paid into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to look at the financial side of the equation to see that Medicare is underfunded, because we can look at the supply side and at the demand side as well. We will see that as money is restricted there is only one thing that we can do, and that is ration services-and that is exactly what this Government is doing. Medicare presides over a system whereby our services and access to health care are being rationed. It is no different from the Eastern Bloc where people queue up for bread-and so many of our fellow citizens have to queue up for access to a hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes great pride in saying that there is a cap, a ceiling, on the amount of expenditure, the proportion of gross domestic product, that we as a nation spend on health care. We can even reduce that if the Minister is prepared to preside over longer queues and have people waiting for a longer length of time. So the system is grossly underfunded and he has to face up to that problem. Until he does, the queues will persist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current system is wasteful. I think the Minister is starting to come to grips with this as he tentatively skirts around the very sensitive issue on his side of politics of bulkbilling. He knows that bulkbilling is wasteful. There is a complete breakdown in the relationship between the provider and the user. For as long as there is a break in that relationship, the system will continue to be wasteful. The Minister has got to do something about restricting bulkbilling or the Government will continue to preside over gross waste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Public hospital costs are far more expensive than they need be. The public hospital system is far more expensive than the private hospital system. One does not have to be an economist to evidence that. One has only to be a patient or visitor to any public hospital around Australia to see ample evidence of the waste and inefficiency. Our hospital system, public and private, across the board has to be made more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest perversity that exists in the system in terms of waste is the hundreds of empty private hospital beds around the country. Medicare has presided over a situation where, as my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) said in his excellent contribution, those privately insured in Australia have dropped as a percentage from above 70 per cent to below 45 per cent. The opportunity for people to go to private hospitals is shrinking as more and more people drop out of the private health system. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister is prepared to face up to those current problems, he should look at what the future holds for him, because the demand is going to get greater and the system is going to require more and more money. A few minutes ago the Minister said, by way of interjection, `More money, more money', in a taunting sense. The system will require more money, and there are three fundamental reasons for that. Firstly, we have an ageing demography. As people grow older and stay alive for longer, they are going to make greater demands on our health care system. Secondly, we have advancing technology in the medical field which keeps people alive for longer. This technology is incredibly expensive, especially in its early years of introduction. Whether the technology is therapeutic or whatever, if it keeps people alive for longer, they will be making greater demands on the health care system. Finally, there is the community expectation. As individuals, we would all want the very best that the world had to offer if it could keep us alive for longer or keep our lives healthier. We are certainly going to want the best for our mothers and fathers. Will the Minister preside over a situation where, Solomon-like, he will say, `You cannot have it, but you can, because we cannot afford it'? The Minister was absolutely right when he interjected, `More money is needed', because more money is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister wants to get into intellectual and intelligent policy debate and front up at this dispatch box and debate the issues, the real policy debate is where the money is going to come from. There is only one source of money and that is from the Australian community. The Minister can get that money from them when they wear their taxpayer hat or their consumer hat, or he can try to increase the quantum of money going to health in this country by a rational and sensible mix between consumers and taxpayers. Until the Minister faces up to that problem, he will not solve any of the fundamental flaws of Medicare that painfully persist for so many thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister could increase the Medicare levy. Despite the interjection earlier by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), for the last seven-odd years the Minister has persisted in the fiction that the Medicare levy funds the system. He has got to come clean and tell the Australian community that the Medicare levy has never funded the system and never will fund the system. </PARA>
<PARA> If we wanted to fund the system fully from taxpayer sources and get rid of those queues and waiting lists, we would need to have a levy of 5 or 6 per cent. Is that what the Minister is going to do after Thursday? Is he going to front up to the dispatch box and at last honestly tell the Australian community, `Mr and Mrs Average, we have been kidding you about Medicare. We admit that there are queues and waiting lists. It has never been fully funded. We are going to solve the problem: your taxes are going to go up by 5 or 6 per cent'? If the Minister did that, he would be intellectually credible and he would certainly have my respect. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other solutions, a range of options. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is courageously fleshing out a range of options that need to be discussed. The Minister should not dare leave this chamber! The Minister should sit down in his seat because he of all people has the responsibility for the next two years of solving this problem. One of the reasonable things he could do would be to join us in debate on this range of options. The Minister should come back into the chamber. There are thousands of people in queues while he skulks out of this chamber. He should come back and face up to this debate. He is a coward. Come back here! The Government is going to run away from these problems. The only way health care will be solved in this country will be to kick the Government out and put us in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill highlights a very dangerous period for the wool industry; a very uncertain and confusing time for thousands of wool growers which will result ultimately in some very tragic individual situations for them over the next two or three years. The stability and certainty of 20 years of a reserve price scheme have gone. The incomes of wool growers on average will fall dramatically next year and the degree of that fall will depend on the price for wool, the inflation rate and interest rates. They will join many wheat growers and horticulturalists who are already suffering these massive falls in income. It means that in total for this financial year farm incomes, that is, the net cash operating surplus, will fall, at this stage on projections, by 68 per cent on last year, which in itself was down 27 per cent, and already is expected by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to fall another considerable percentage next year. Of all of those projections for next year, the most dramatic are for wool growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Bureau made these projections-and it really made them late last year in time for the Agricultural Outlook conference-it made them on the basis that the reserve price scheme would continue. One thing we have to face up to is that irrespective of whether the scheme was to continue-and now, as we know, it will not continue-wool growers were facing a dramatic decline in their income next year. On the basis of those projections-as I said, made at a time when the floor price was to continue-the net farm cash operating surplus for this year for wool growers would be down 82 per cent to $9,500, and next year it would be a massive 139 per cent for a loss of $3,700 for the average wool grower. I remind the House that those figures relate to an average capital value of well over $1m per property, so there would be no return on capital and no allowance for management, and input costs would be reduced dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems facing agriculture and particularly wool growers in the next few years-and it is highlighted in the survey recently released by the National Farmers Federation-is that if farmers dramatically reduce their inputs, as distinct from the past, in making themselves more productive than any other sector in Australia, it will carry with it problems for their longer term viability and productivity as well as their short term viability, as I have just highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the National Party, I believe our Party has a very proud record of support for the wool industry. As a newcomer to Parliament in 1972, I was here when the first reserve price legislation-except for the deficiency payment support legislation-was introduced. At that time, because I was entering Parliament, I sold the sheep we had because there was no longer anyone at home to look after them. That was my last direct involvement with the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to commend people like Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair, Malcolm Fraser and others who were in the coalition Government at that time for the work that they did. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), as recently as today, has reminded us that the original concept of that reserve price legislation was to make sure that wool remained competitive with competing fibres. One of the fundamental errors made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and this Government was to change the whole basis of the scheme in 1987 in relation to the final say for setting the floor price and particularly in removing from the legislation the criteria that were essential to maintain a realistic outlook or attitude towards the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties-both the National and Liberal parties-have maintained support for that scheme ever since those early days. We maintained that support-I emphasise this-right up to 1 February, when the Australian Wool Corporation was forced to suspend sales because the scheme was no longer sustainable, as the Government was not prepared to advance the additional $1 billion considered necessary by the Corporation to maintain the buying-in procedures, to maintain the stockpile in the scheme, until the end of June. That announcement meant that the floor price was gone. We have to be realistic about that-for all practical purposes it has gone. </PARA>
<PARA> When other members of the Party and I stated the reality that the floor price was gone, there was some comment that somehow the National Party had changed, that somehow it had deserted wool growers and forgotten about its reason for being-to protect country people and country industries. </PARA>

<PARA> The real point is that the National Party is, as it was then, in existence to represent country people, regional people, and particularly-as far as I am concerned-those people who make their living from the land. At all times we have to be aware of what is the best policy for those people. As we have at times indicated that things should be done for those people, equally we have a responsibility to be honest and, if what is in place is no longer to their advantage, to say so. And we did, believing that in the medium term and the longer term, with the scheme not sustainable, wool growers would be better off with the removal of the floor price. That is a very grave statement to make, but on the evidence available to me and to others I believe that is an indisputable fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I again remind the House that irrespective of whether the current scheme-that is, the old floor price scheme-was to continue there was going to be a dramatic fall in wool growers' incomes this financial year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table indicates the severity of the debt crisis facing wool growers and indicates that the length of that crisis would be greater if the scheme continued. That has been confirmed by individual members of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia, who do not particularly want to be named but who nevertheless have said it, as have people involved in providing credit for wool growers, and who are aware of the financial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason is obvious: there is an increasingly large stockpile of wool. That stockpile was heading towards six million bales at the end of this wool selling season, with a total debt approaching $4 billion, and an interest bill annually of some $600m to be paid by wool growers. The Minister has indicated that on the projections of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics that stockpile could reach 8.7 million bales at the end of the following wool selling season. The $440m annual interest payment to cover the existing debt of $2.8 billion could take 15 to 20 per cent of wool growers' incomes next year, but if the scheme continued the debt would be even higher. Our projections, when we rejected the attempt by the Government to introduce this super tax on wool growers of up to 50 per cent, were that that 50 per cent figure was realistic, not imaginary, because with the scheme the stockpile would be greater. If any equity were to be maintained in the stockpile, which was one of the criteria for the Wool Corporation, then a 40 to 50 per cent tax was a very realistic figure. </PARA>
<PARA> There were warnings about the problems to come. I wish to quote from the speech by Hugh Beggs, Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, to the Wool Council of Australia conference at Launceston on 7 November last year. Referring to the procedures required by the trade to get wool through the system and the time lags, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The apparel manufacturer needs to start cutting in April/May for July onwards delivery. It is necessary for him to take a position in fabrics pre-Christmas, in fact, the latest that weaving can start for the first cuttings is during January. This means that orders for wool, tops and yarn are normally placed during November/December. </PARA>
<PARA>That is for the following autumn and winter sales in the northern hemisphere. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>We already know that the pipeline is de-stocked and the trade is waiting for something to happen to the Australian floor price, but there will come a time within the next 4-8 weeks when people will have to appear in the market. The critical period is between now and mid-February. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very accurate warning of what was to happen. I wish to quote one other point from his speech because it highlights one of the other problems confronting the industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The most urgent problem facing the Australian wool industry is to bring our production back into line with world demand. </PARA>
<PARA>I also want to quote from an article by Hugh Beggs, a man I have considerable respect for, in the Stock &amp;Land of 14 February. It is entitled `Reserve price ``had to end'' '. I want to make the point that this is the Chairman of the Wool Corporation saying that the wool price had to end. Some of the reasons he gave included:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no guarantee that stocks will stop rising on June 30, 1991, with or without quotas and we cannot accurately predict trade clearances. </PARA>
<PARA> Every bale of wool bought from now on must almost certainly cost more than its eventual value in interest and storage costs. This is not commercially rational. </PARA>
<PARA> To continue to operate the 700c/kg floor would almost inevitably lead to a stock pile of more than six million bales and a debt of $4 billion or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a level of debt covered by Government guarantee is politically unacceptable and the burden of funding and servicing of such a debt would be intolerable for the wool growing industry to bear, and too great to ask the taxpayer to subsidise for long. It is bad enough already. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the overhang of so much wool on the market would keep the price down to 700c/kg or near to it for so long that wool growing would become unprofitable for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of those circumstances the continued operation of the reserve price scheme became unsustainable and the corporation called for the suspension of all wool sales while we discussed the future with the Government and industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The views of these people should be respected in this matter. They indicate that the pain of continuing the scheme for wool growers was greater and would last for a longer period than if the scheme was stopped. I believe that the Minister has been disappointing in this regard. We learned at his press conference recently that as long ago as last October he was aware that the floor price was not sustainable. Yet he did not do anything to prepare the industry, or even prepare the legislation that was obviously going to be inevitable. The legislation that we are seeing today is hastily drawn and badly drafted. I believe that the Minister could have been more realistic in drawing attention to the oversupply situation and given a more realistic presentation of the hard facts facing the industry. But I acknowledge that it is a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Twice before within the wool industry there was a considerable stockpile of wool, up to 1.8 million bales at one stage. On both occasions the industry recovered and went on to a stronger future, not only for wool growers but for the balance of trade for Australia. We had those three great years of 1986, 1987 and 1988 where a false impression was created that a new plateau for wool had arrived. This was partly due to the buying of wool by Russia and China. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of a National Party delegation that went to China late last year. We concentrated on discussions with wool industry people. I became angry with what I believed was the lack of information provided to wool growers in Australia about the real situation of the wool industry in China. China, because of its internal wool policies and other internal policies of creating employment in its counties, of the factory suit situation for employees, of allowing some unnecessary competition to occur in its buying procedures, created a completely false impression for the demand for wool by China, both internally and for export. While we were there we learnt that there was a stockpile of domestic wool in China equal to more than a year's supply and that the floor price, or the buying-in price, for its wool had just been halved. </PARA>
<PARA> We also learnt that unfortunately because our floor price was carrying the wool industries of the other wool producing countries when the Chinese were buying wool for re-export-they were certainly not buying foreign wool for the domestic market to any degree because they were under a variety of incentives and controls to reduce their own stockpile-they could buy South American wool consistently 15 to 20 per cent cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> In those heady days there was the belief that there was that new price relationship, that we had broken the barrier between a wool synthetic price ratio of 3 : 1 to 5 : 1 or 6 : 1. Production increased to over 1,000 million kilograms, in spite of the fact that the biggest sale for any year that we have ever had was 900 million kilograms. It has now declined to an estimated 530 million kilograms this year. Next year, if quotas were in, the realistic figure would have been a maximum of 600 million kilograms on the quota proposal. But let me just look at the rapid decline in the two last years which indicated the oversupply situation and falling demand. In 1989-90, there were 1,029 million kilograms produced, 523 million kilograms sold. This year it is projected that 1,019 million kilograms will be produced and 530 million kilograms sold. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why the coalition parties pushed so hard for a significant sheep slaughter or, to put it slightly more kindly, a flock reduction scheme. We did it deliberately because we believed it was the only way to address that oversupply problem in the time available and to send a strong message to wool users around the world that Australia meant business in bringing supply back to demand. Even though the scheme was never pushed to the degree it should have been I understand that at this stage about 8 1/2 million sheep have been contracted to be removed. I believe that the wool industry will regret its failure to support that scheme more wholeheartedly. </PARA>
<PARA> We arrived at the situation in mid-January, with the opening sales of early January looking good and then a sudden collapse. There is no shortage of reasons as to why the market collapsed. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, gave his view of some of these reasons in Question Time today. There was the activity of the Vines Committee in Europe, asking people what their reaction would be to a lowered floor price. There was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and his famous correspondence. There were, according to many others, sales from the stockpile by the Wool Corporation at a critical time. Others would say that there was the submission of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to the Vines Committee. I think, above anything, there was the fact that wool users had filled the pipeline to the degree that they wanted to because they kept looking at the stockpile and the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have this difficult situation with this legislation. The coalition parties have had many hours of discussion, in committees and with the industry, shadow Ministry and joint parties. We believe that the most important things to do are, as quickly as possible, to get confidence again in the industry and in the marketing of wool and to limit the debt to wool growers. The stockpile is the key to both of those objectives. We believe that sales should commence, as advertised, on Monday; that the management of wool stocks with confidence is of critical importance; and that the reality is that the floor price is more than suspended-it really is finished. </PARA>
<PARA> With limiting debt, I refer to the supplementary payments scheme, which we support. We support the $300m grant by the Government. We believe it is important to provide equity to wool growers. Interestingly enough, New Zealand did not when it suspended its scheme. But we believe there is a great danger here that the Wool Corporation debt, already $2.9 billion, could blow out to $4 billion if this scheme is allowed to remain open ended. The Minister and others have made certain guesstimates as to what it could cost, but those in the industry are tremendously worried that at a time when, in their view, they will not be able to sustain the interest payments of $440m a year, they could be up for $600m a year. If we look at, say, a $2.5 billion to $3 billion gross income for the wool industry next year, we can see what a hole $500m or $600m in interest payments will make in an income that is already dramatically reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is important to put a cap of $500m on that scheme, to bring some discipline into growers so that they do not just give their wool away, and to send a message to buyers that they cannot just take it for nothing. I believe that would be providing equity while at the same time limiting the debt load of all wool growers for the next few years. It is obvious that the Government scheme will not provide complete equity for the 700c regime. I have seen copies of guidelines which indicate that through a system of benchmark and notional price arrangements, there will be a percentage loss to growers. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the stockpile, we agree that the ownership, management and repayment responsibility of the stockpile should remain with the industry, but it is important to have very clear guidelines for and understanding by the trade on the reduction of the stockpile. The best way to have that is by legislation rather than by regulation, because it also protects the industry from any attempt to interfere with an orderly process. Within the first 12 months, there should be basically a freeze other than for certain exceptional circumstances. We believe that, to provide the necessary confidence to the industry, that should be in place now rather than just being in place until the end of this wool selling season, which is the proposal by the Government at the present time. People are asking what will happen after the end of June, and there is enough uncertainty about that while we wait for the Vines report and the recommendation for or suggestion of further legislation in May. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, as I said earlier, has been very badly and dangerously drafted. It gives the Minister far too much ability to bring in regulation-to govern by regulation-including one provision in particular. I refer to proposed new section 148 (2) (b), under the heading `Regulations', which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . amend any provision of this Act other than this Part. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very dangerous power for a Minister to have, because it means he can basically override any part of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not, and I am sure the industry does not at present and will not in the future-and for very good reason. We will be moving an amendment to delete that clause, just as we will be moving amendments to indicate that in reality the floor price has ended, to put a cap of $500m-$200m of borrowed money for growers-on the supplementary payments scheme and also to legislate for the stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition does support the ministerial power to terminate appointments to the board. It is a general power which I think is necessary with this very difficult and mixed responsibility of statutory marketing corporations, because they are more than representatives of growers; they operate on a delegated authority from government. The power must not be used capriciously, and I believe at the present time it is important for the Wool Corporation to be in place until the end of June for the important role that still faces it and the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> At this difficult time the future is the important point for the industry. There is the problem of debt for growers. That will be a recurring debt every year with interest payments as well as reduced incomes. That is why we are strongly supporting a significant increase for rural adjustment and rural counselling and also stressing the importance of debt assessments via a combination of banks, rural adjustment authorities, State rural agencies and so forth. That is because, as the price of wool falls, the price of land will fall and there will be some very dangerous asset debt situations, which are not apparent at this stage, with growers not being able to sell. That may mean, of course, problems not just for farms but for whole regional communities. The income equalisation deposit scheme, which the Government ruined seven years ago and for which wool growers had to pay about an additional billion dollars of tax as a result, is the best way to bring some individual income stability back to growers, acknowledging that that can only happen when their incomes improve, because these measures really do not work for people with a low taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a responsibility with promotion, credit and live sheep sales, and it also has a responsibility finally to remove that confounded tariff on cool wool, which is still there even though the Government claimed it removed it. It also has the responsibility to get on with the business of reducing input cost to growers. That accounts for 60 per cent of the total cost problem confronting agriculture in this country. The Minister has not accepted his responsibility to do these things and to make in the rest of the community the adjustments that have been demanded of the wool industry. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``, in the light of the urgent need to restore confidence by wool producers and buyers in the long term future of the industry, to end the confusion that the Government's policies have engendered and to assist the immediate resumption of wool sales, the House does not decline to give the Bill a second reading, but is of the opinion that the reserve price in respect of wool offered for sale should not be suspended only, as the Bill proposes, but should be terminated forthwith''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much comment has been made during the last week regarding the suspension of the wool reserve price scheme until 30 June. We now need to get some enthusiasm and vision into the wool industry to give growers confidence to press on. There is no doubt that things will recover, but it will take time. The situation will take several years to recover, given the stockpile of wool that we have. The decision to suspend the floor price has been made at a time when many Northern Hemisphere manufacturers are about to make decisions on fibres for the 1992-93 retail season. It is crucial that we now get on with the job of restoring confidence in the marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a vast imbalance between supply and demand. The record high years of 1988-89 and 1989-90 gave the industry a false sense of security. Buyers reacted to the high floor price in some instances by turning to cheaper fibres. If wool is to survive and prosper as a fibre, it must be competitive with its substitutes. That applies whether it is in competition with cotton or synthetics. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that there was any real option but to end the stockpiling of wool that was steadily sending the industry broke. To continue to operate the 700c floor price would almost inevitably have led to a stockpile of some six million bales plus and a burgeoning debt of approximately $4 billion or more with no upper limit. It simply does not make sense to continue to overproduce and to buy our own product. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of debt covered by government guarantee would be politically unacceptable and an intolerable burden for the wool growing industry to bear. It would certainly be too great to ask the taxpayer to subsidise it for long. A continued depressed demand for wool would force individual growers to accept drastically reduced production quotas and the possibility of higher tax levels merely to service the likely debt levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always been concerned about quotas because of the various types of wool produced around the country. There is still a much better demand and price for finer wools than for coarser wools. Those growers who have not overproduced and who have stayed within their limits prior to the last four or five years would be adversely affected for being prudent and making the right decision. Consequently I have never been of the view that quotas work or are fair because they have a negative impact on the more visionary growers. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of unpredictable world events have proved to be all negatives for the wool industry-namely, the onset of war in the Middle East and the turmoil in Russia and Eastern bloc countries, causing them to stay out of the market. The consequent economic effects are taking place in those countries right now.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not been sitting idle over the last 12 months. A wide range of measures has been implemented by the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) to endeavour to restore confidence in the market and to put the wool industry on the road to recovery. I would like to give just a few examples: the floor price was reduced last year; the Vines inquiry was instigated; the interim Wool Policy Council was established; a business plan and strategic plan from the Australian Wool Corporation was called for; and of course, the wool mission resulted in the provision of $400m to Russia by way of a credit facility. However, despite the adoption of this range of measures, the situation has continued to deteriorate, largely as a result of continuing speculation that the scheme was unsustainable and because of other influences such as the crisis in the Soviet Union and the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool selling arrangements to apply after 30 June will be finalised in April after Cabinet considers the recommendations of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing, which will report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) by 31 March. The Government will contribute some $300m towards a supplementary payments scheme to woolgrowers who sell their wool during the remainder of the 1990-91 season. Supplementary payments will make up the difference between market prices for wool and what would have been received under the 700c per kilogram reserve price. The remainder of the cost of these payments will be financed by the industry through the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The suspension of the reserve price scheme in mid-season leaves a potential equity problem. There will be those growers who have already sold their wool at 700c, much of which has gone into the stockpile, and those who will be offering wool for sale between now and July. In the absence of supplementary measures, those yet to sell would bear the brunt of the initial market adjustment caused by events over the last two years. The wool tax will remain at 25 per cent for the remainder of the 1990-91 season. The Government will provide assistance to those most affected in the wool industry through the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program. The Government will provide additional substantial funds for these purposes, and it is important that that be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst responsibility for the servicing of the debt of the Australian Wool Corporation and the wool stockpile will remain with the Corporation, the Government will lift the ceiling on its guarantee of the borrowings of the Australian Wool Corporation to $3.5 billion. The Government will extend its guarantee on all borrowings beyond 1992 for the period required to manage the run-down of the industry's debt. It is estimated that it will take about five years to bring the debt of the Australian Wool Corporation to a manageable level. </PARA>
<PARA> Final details for the orderly disposal of wool now held in the stockpile, management of the assets of the Australian Wool Corporation and wool promotion will be jointly developed by the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation upon receipt of the Vines committee report. There is a much better prospect of bringing both the Wool Corporation debt and wool stocks under control in the absence of a floor price and without the Wool Corporation buying in the market. During the period of suspension, the Corporation will not be permitted to buy wool. To all intents and purposes, the Wool Corporation stockpile will be frozen with the final details to be worked out between the Minister and the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made for the Minister to appoint for a limited period an interim administrator or interim board of the Australian Wool Corporation. These powers have been included to allow the Minister to ensure the ongoing operation of the board. It is intended that the Minister consult with the industry in making such appointments. It is to be hoped that the Australian Wool Corporation will work with the Government to implement the processes that will need to be gone through to get new arrangements in the industry in place by 1 July 1991. If there is to be any reserve price scheme from 1 July, it will be self-funding and the floor price will be set conservatively against the prevailing market price. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development is critical for the long term future of the wool industry. The Government will be prepared to consider increased assistance for research and development. To ensure that it is not compromised by Australian Wool Corporation funding difficulties, a Wool Research and Development Corporation will be established as a separate entity. However, it will share accommodation and administrative services with the AWC unless its own board determines that these services can be provided more efficiently by other means. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no denying that there is no quick solution for the wool industry. The current difficulties of Australia's premier agricultural industry, the wool industry, are well known and well documented. With the exodus of China and the Eastern bloc from the marketplace and with the continuing war in the Middle East, this decision was the one appropriate solution to redress the market problems and imbalances. The important thing now is for everyone to get behind the new arrangements and make them work. There is enough doom and gloom. Fair enough, the situation at present is grim, but it is time for all levels of the wool industry to adopt a positive approach and to get out there and sell the wool clip. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision has been made with the best long term interests of wool producers in mind. We all know that Australian wool fibre is the best, so it is up to us to convince the marketplace. I believe that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has acted responsibly in the management of the problems within the industry. No-one else has come forward with solutions that offered a better outcome for growers. It is a time for definite plans and tough decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted in the Australian Financial Review of last Friday that Japan has been critical of the decision taken regarding the suspension of the wool floor price. There is concern that our trade could be affected. I have a good memory and remember a contract price for four years for sugar. The contract was signed by Japanese companies. Once the world price dropped below that price, the Japanese importing companies simply refused to honour their signed agreements. So Japan is the last country that should ever talk about the way in which any decisions we make in the interests of our producers affect trade negotiations. Given the Holy Grail attitude towards rice in Japan, I think that we, in making decisions in the long term interests of our industry, stand much cleaner on free trade and on doing the right thing than any critics in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that needs to be briefly touched on before I close is the effect of the debt and the interest rate that will be applied to wool growers and other primary producers in the grains sector over the next few years. I have just left a meeting with the National Farmers Federation. It is preparing a submission to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for its inquiry into the banking industry-which I think can be constructive and informative on the issues and problems affecting primary producers, including meeting their debt. The Queensland Farmers Federation is doing the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we are now seeing all sections of rural Australia understanding each other and working together-particularly, with regard to this Bill, the wool industry-in order to overcome what is one of the most severe problems that agriculture has faced for a long time. But we shall overcome it because, as I have said, we produce the finest wool and Australian farmers are the best in the world, working under the harshest of conditions. But unity and a sense of purpose are needed. In closing, I again compliment the Minister for the courageous and visionary way in which he has handled one of the toughest decisions that agriculture has faced since the war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Courageous and visionary. What a remarkable statement to make in this place. We are discussing here the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill-another piece of bandaid legislation; another example of a government staggering around trying to find a solution and not being prepared to give it. This piece of legislation is notable more for what it does not say than for what it does say. This piece of legislation will rely on a series of guidelines to be issued by the very individual who stands here condemned for the current state of the wool industry. This piece of legislation suggests that it is not enough to impose a long term $3,000m debt on the wool growers of Australia, but in fact seeks to add another $1 billion. I support wholeheartedly the attempts of the Opposition, by amendment, to keep that debt to approximately its current position of $3 billion. It is pretty easy to see why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Every time this Government has tried to make some sort of attempt to defy gravity-to defy the logic and the arithmetic that was so patently obvious-it has added another $1 billion onto the debt. When the Government reduced the reserve price from 870c to 700c as some sort of interim measure, because it lacked the courage then to tell wool growers that it was time to consider their welfare and not their prejudice, the wool industry, through its reserve price scheme, owed about $1.4 billion. By the time the Government had got to the next stage of tripling or quadrupling the tax levels and talking about quotas, the industry owed about $2 billion. Now, of course, it owes $2.8 billion or $2.9 billion-we are not exactly sure even of that. But we do know that it is a massive debt, and the Government brings to us a proposal-it says on the grounds of equity-because it is not yet courageous enough to establish a totally free market with all of the pain and suffering that goes with that. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government tell us? The Government tells us that it will chuck in a lousy $300m but that the wool growers will have to put themselves in debt by a further $1,000m. When I talk about wool growers I do not mean only the beneficiaries of the scheme in the past-of course they are not exactly beneficiaries because they stand to lose $1.8 billion in growers' funds that existed when this fiasco commenced. The reality is that this money will just grow and grow because of the interest component. Let us look at the interest component. I guess it might be optimistic to claim that in a free market 200c clean will be a price indicator. If it is, then the gross on 1,000 million kilograms of wool-which is the possible level of production-would be $2 billion. It is suggested that at $3 billion the interest cost is $400m and, of course, on $2 billion that is a 20 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we have legislation before us here today which is saying, `Let's increase that by another 30 per cent; let's increase it to 27 per cent on 200c a kilogram clean'. That is what this Bill suggests. That is what it leaves wide open. I hope that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will join with the Opposition and say, `That is impossible. It is bad enough that we, the Government, through our procrastination, have let the debt grow to $3 billion'. The Minister is apparently of the opinion that wool growers-some of whom are not yet in the industry because this interest payment will go on for years-must service that debt. But the Minister has decided to make them pay and now he wants to load them up with an additional debt. The Minister gives us a piece of legislation that does not tell us where the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) might finish. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a wool grower. I am being told by this legislation to put my faith in John Kerin because he is going to issue guidelines to save me. I thank the Minister, but I would prefer that he did not take the job, because so far his representations on my behalf, and on behalf of all of those other thousands of wool growers in Australia, have been disastrous. The Minister listens to a few industry bureaucrats and he lacks the courage to tell them the simple arithmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the simple arithmetic when we were being told to have confidence-that all the industry needed to have was confidence and the miracle would occur? I have looked at the weekly sales of AWC stocks as they stood for the period from 1 July to October 1990-a significant date in that year when the Minister came back to this Parliament with his second proposal for saving the industry and upped the tax levels substantially; in fact, potentially, to 50 per cent. Of course, a little later he came in with his quota proposal. I underline the fact that they are the Minister's proposals. I know where he got them from, but he brought them to this Parliament. The Minister argued for them; he is the person who is responsible for them, just as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is responsible for the banks in this country, as much as he would like to convince us to the contrary. We all take responsibility for the legislation that we bring into this place and we are all supposed to take responsibility for our departments. </PARA>
<PARA> But at that time when we were told that all we had to do was pay all this additional tax I discovered from the figures that actual sales of wool for that session-that is, until 19 October 1990-amounted to about 105 million kilograms. Yet all the claims of the Wool Corporation were predicated on an annual clearance of 700 million kilograms and that the fairy godmother or godfather, whoever it was, of wool was going to come along-it was nearly half-way through the selling season-and somehow or other in the second half of the season we were going to clear 500-odd million kilograms of wool, provided we could get the extra tax. That was the first item of arithmetic. It was impossible, but nobody had the courage to get up and say that. I certainly would have said it at that time, but of course the legislation was debated under the guillotine and I was denied the opportunity to do so. I certainly said it in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker; it is a pity that the honourable member's ability in arithmetic does not equate with his ability to interject, otherwise he too might have seen that the numbers were against him. But what did this magnificent scheme do? We kept saying that it was preserving 700c for the wool grower. But of course, when the tax was deducted and when some reasonable assessment was made of what the quota might be-and that was the same as a tax; the Government said to the wool grower that the Wool Corporation would no longer stockpile his wool and that he had to stockpile it himself-there was an actual payment to the wool grower of less than 250c a kilogram clean on that 700c. Yet time and again I have heard people say that if we had this dreadful free market, the price might fall to 300c. As a wool grower, I could be so lucky if it did. I would be 50c better off and I could bid my wool goodbye as it went to some needy consumer. People might actually get back to using the stuff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been through the most remarkable situation. We provide to the world a fibre which represents less than 2 per cent of the world apparel fibre market and we have said, `If you don't pay our price, we'll teach you a lesson. We won't let you use it'. To which people have responded, `Okay, we won't use it'. They have closed their mills; they have gone and found some readily available synthetics. They have fluffed cotton up a bit more and made it fleecy lined. They have got by. We have sat here kidding ourselves. But what is worse is that a government that claims-and I have always disagreed with the claim-that it is economically rational has gone along with this scheme for six months now when the arithmetic-not the ideology-said it would not work. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of this legislation that concern me. As I have already said, most importantly they are those parts of the legislation which give unlimited power to the Minister and leave open ended even the amount of debt. That part of the legislation gives me, as a wool grower, and my wool grower constituents, no guarantee as to how the debt might even be managed. The Government just tells us we have got to pay the bills. It is very clear on that point. The wool growers have to pick up the tab-but the mugs will continue to manage the system. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need another bandaid. We do not need to have floating out there this idea-which I cannot believe even the Minister believes; I think the honourable for Hinkler alluded to it-that in July we might actually be able to resurrect the reserve price, at some very modest level. In the Minister's response he might tell us whether that is a possibility, because it means a continuation of the disaster. I do not want to know that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to tell the Minister what the situation is. I do not like, for a start, government by committee. I do not have to be told by Mr Vines what is wrong with the wool industry. It is all there in the numbers. They are very clear and very simple. Those that one has to study are limited. In other words, it is quite appropriate to take a decision now, to put the certainty into the wool industry that everybody says he wants. And how do we do that? Quite simply. First, as has been recommended by the Opposition, the stockpile is frozen. Secondly, a receiver to the Wool Corporation is appointed as the obvious creditor. I do not think the banks that have lent the money need to do it. The Government is the guarantor; it has given that guarantee. That was another mistake. What is more, having done it, it is now responsible for any deficiency from the resolution. I say to the Government: put a receiver in; get the matter cleaned up; and pick the best possible man to ensure that the deficiency-which it still argues is the responsibility of the wool industry-is at a minimum. For once do the right thing. Do not let this thing drag on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government's proposal for supplementary payments. I can see the argument for equity. I just do not know how the Government will make it work. I have really applied my mind to that project. I do not know how the Government will prevent abuse. I do not know how it will give a wool grower in a future market the incentive to get the best price for his wool before he gets the balance from the Wool Corporation. I do not know how the whole thing will work when the Government will probably increase the Wool Corporation's debt by another $1 billion but not give it one more pound or kilogram of wool. At least the debts that the Wool Corporation has incurred to date have been for the purpose of buying wool. The next $1 billion that the Government proposes to put on the Wool Corporation by way of indebtedness is with no security at all; it just hands out the money. The Government has difficulties with the equity argument, but for once it should try to resolve them. It is the Government's problem-and the Government should fix it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is totally correct to demand a cap on the debts of the Wool Corporation and to demand that the Government show how for $300m or $400m it can provide an equity deal. Of course, if the Government removes some of the proposed complexities and looks at some net supplementary payment in July, it might find that it can make $300m go quite a long way. But the worst possible proposal is to feed it in one end, tax it, take it out, build it up, and then leave wool growers-some yet to enter the industry-with a debt for the next decade. It is stupid and it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's mistake because it could not understand the arithmetic of the Wool Corporation and it could not understand the history of cartels, buffer stock schemes-call them what you like-and do the right thing when the writing was on the wall, really and truly, at the beginning of this financial year. But certainly when the Government eventually dragged itself to make a decision and lowered the floor price from 870c to 700c it knew that it was gone. And $2 billion later we are still arguing about interim measures: the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill. What a dreadful thing for a Minister to have to bring to the Parliament-temporary provisions for an industry that was turning over $6 billion a year a couple of years ago and has traditionally provided $3 billion or $4 billion to the Australian economy. It cannot go on. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise a matter of concern to me about the deficiency payment process. I would like the Minister to respond officially. Although I have done some reading on it I need to know-and I think that wool growers are entitled to know-what the Government will do about the private traders in wool. They are very significant in the industry in Western Australia. Producers are deeply concerned that deficiency payments might be made only to those who sell their wool through the auction system. I hope that is not the case. I am not saying that that is the case because I do not know. They need to know about this matter. If that were to occur their future would be devastated. They have suffered enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I talked to one the other day and it was interesting. We talked about value added in Australia. He actually built a scouring works. But of course, the Wool Corporation has been buying so much of the Australian wool clip for so long that he could not find any wool to put in his wool scour. Of course, the Corporation was not prepared to give him any; it wanted to stockpile it all as greasy-`You may as well store the lanolin along with the wool'. It does not give a few Aussie workers, whom Labor members claim to represent, the chance to earn a living cleaning it up. This high-tech modern scour built in the last two or three years went broke. It could not get any wool to process because the Wool Corporation was buying it all-and apparently the Government did not even know about that. It is a classic example of its stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the Government's outrageous proposal, in terms of its totally ignoring the situation that has occurred, it should do something. We do not want temporary provisions; we want the matter resolved. The Opposition has given the Government a lead. It is a proper proposal and, no doubt, if the Government were to come to us and say, `Here is a positive proposal to wrap the whole thing up'-pre-Vines report; in other words, the Minister makes a decision in his own right for once-we will help it, and we will tell it why: this is too big for politics. This is about saving what is historically Australia's largest single industry. If we do not do something that is a lot better than these so-called temporary and vague provisions, the country will be in a lot of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool growers do not have to have politicians forced upon them any longer. Most of them now want out, and most of them want a free market, but they do not want to have to carry the burden of another $1,000m to make the Government look good out in the electorate. That is all these provisions are for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I must say that on several occasions he made an observation that I completely agreed with, and that does not happen all that often. On at least four occasions the honourable member for O'Connor said, `I don't know how'. That is about the strength of it: he does not know how. He does not know how to find solutions to these difficult problems. With regard to the little tale that he introduced at the end of his speech about the Australian Wool Corporation driving a scouring process broke, I think the Parliament ought to listen to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) when he contributes to this debate because I understand that he is the member of this House who has been working on behalf of that operation. The honourable member for O'Connor has just come in here today to saddle up once again for a bit of cheap point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to start my contribution to the debate by saying that what I find utterly deceitful on the part of the Opposition is that, having come into this Parliament, having endorsed and gone along with every step that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has taken in this whole sorry wool tale, it is now going around Australia talking to people in the rural sector, spinning this kind of populist cant that the honourable member has just gone on with, about how dreadful the Government is for having stuffed up the wool industry. That is what its people are saying, when every one of us in this place knows that each time a vote has been taken, each time the proposal has been brought forward, the Opposition has supported the Government because there was nowhere else to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill. I join with the honourable member for O'Connor in making the observation that, whilst the Bill is called temporary provisions legislation, I think we are looking at something that will be a permanent change in the way in which the wool industry conducts its affairs. Certainly, the growers I have talked to are prepared for that and are keen to see it develop into the situation that I think will eventuate from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not sufficient just to say now that the Government and the Minister brought in legislation at the start of the financial year and now it has to be taken further because it was got wrong then. I think most people who are going to take a responsible view of this debate will understand that at the time there were two roads down which the Government and the Australian Wool Corporation could go. There was much debate about which of those two was the one to take. There is no doubt that, at a time when Australia's balance of payments was fragile, we were in fact playing a game of bluff with the world in terms of our wool price. There was an expectation that, if we lowered the wool price to 700c, that may see buyers re-enter the market. There were some signs that buyers were prepared to re-enter the market but it has not proved to be the case. That is the reality, as the Opposition well knows, because today once again it intends to support the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I go back to the point that it is all very well to come in here and support the legislation, but it is utterly deceitful to then wander around rural Australia claiming that the Opposition did not do that-as the honourable member for O'Connor tried to claim just a moment ago. That is a message that needs to be understood. There is no choice now but to move away from the floor price; I think that is well understood. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the equation. To maintain the floor price at 700c, increase the tax and carry the costs, particularly the interest cost of borrowing to sustain the stockpile, by some calculations which have been made public, and which I have seen, we are talking about a cost of something like 350c to 400c in equivalent terms. In other words, with this legislation and the removal of the floor price, if there was to be a fall in the price that got the stockpile moving, it could fall to 350c to 400c before any grower would be worse off than he is in the present situation. I think that is something that the growers, rather than people like the honourable member for O'Connor, understand very well. It is one of the reasons why they support this action. </PARA>
<PARA> They also recognise that the Government has been prepared to quarantine the existing stockpile and the undertakings that have been given in relation to the floor price up to the time of the announcement. The likely cost of that to the Government is $300m in these days when every cent of Government expenditure in the public budget is under scrutiny. I think a $300m commitment on the part of this Government-the proposal brought forward by Minister Kerin-represents a good faith position with the growers and one about which I am very happy to talk to growers in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raise the anomalous position of people like the honourable member for O'Connor and others who are clinging to the notion that in some way a government supported floor price ought to remain in place. I have heard absolutely nothing from those people about the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission a couple of weeks ago in response to industry representations to award the shearers their 6 per cent national wage increase, but to award it on the basis of the industry's capacity to pay. It is an award that is made virtually in terms of the free market. When wool starts flowing, when the revenue is there to pay the wage increase, the Commission is prepared for the wage increase to flow on. On the one hand, these people are arguing that the grower should continue to receive a guaranteed floor price courtesy of the Government and the Wool Corporation but, on the other hand, the shearer should get the wage flow-on if and when the industry is in a position to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the decision means that growers who have been shifting their wool will now pay the wage flow-on; those who have been getting the 2 per cent greasy through the system can pay and others not. There has been absolutely nothing from the Opposition about that anomalous position. It ought to be talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> I broaden my comments marginally in one other area; that is, in response to the observations made by the honourable member for O'Connor about the wool scouring operation in Western Australia. I do not know the details of that; I will leave it to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. It raises the issue of one of the major needs in this economy-to move as quickly as possible to much more value adding. As the Government works its way through its industry statement and the principles that will be behind that, I am certain that many of us will be making the point that import replacement is just as important as export enhancement. I raise that because there is a considerable amount of import replacement involved in value adding significantly in the first stages of downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of downstream processing cast a black cloud over the Opposition parties' 30 years in government from 1949-23 years and then a further seven years under Malcolm Fraser. Every commonsense Australian was saying, `This is crazy. We send coal and iron ore to Japan and we buy back cars, and we send wool and other primary products to countries and we buy back clothes. Why aren't we manufacturing more of these products ourselves?'. The reason was that it was easier to grow something, dig it up or cut it down. Every developing country makes its early money and earns its early foreign exchange by exploiting its natural resources. The hard part is actually turning these resources into something, which requires education, investment in plant and equipment, and marketing and management skills at an international level. Absolutely nothing of any substance was done during those 30 years when the Opposition parties were in government to add those components to Australia's intellectual and skill base. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the black cloud that remains over the contribution by the Opposition. That is why we are still having debates now on the wool stockpile. Why should the wool stockpile even need to be sold overseas? Why are there no corporations in Australia buying that wool stockpile and turning it into value added products for export?</PARA>
<PARA> Much more work has to be done on developing these aspects of the Australian economy. They are not aspects about which farmers are particularly concerned. Indeed, I have sat across the table from representatives of the National Farmers Federation who have told the Government that they are not interested in seeing these value adding concepts put to work if they threaten the future of their primary produce. In other words, if farmers see even the slightest danger in Australian manufacturers not getting it right, they would rather sell their raw wool bales overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Gippsland acknowledges, that is the position of Australian farmers. That position is driven by a great deal of self-interest, which I can understand. However, that attitude will not transform the economic equation in this country. Indeed, when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy took the original decision on the wool stockpile and asked whether Australia could sustain a floor price at 700c, we had to ask ourselves some questions. Where was the demand, and why had it collapsed? Is an alternative supplier emerging? Are our customers buying their wool somewhere else? There was no intelligence from either the Australian Wool Corporation or elsewhere to indicate any real problem. Other questions were: was there a substitute? Were the manufacturers of the world turning to some other product because our wool price was too high? Even then there was no real evidence that that was likely to be a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one believes that the collapse in buying was really the result of the cartels deciding to sit and use their stocks to try to drive the price down or alternatively to react early to a potential world recession by minimising their stocks, one believes it was a waiting game with buyers trying to hold out. That is what the available information pointed to. I have been trying to get producers to understand that if Australia performed the downstream processing, that game of international bluff would not be going on, and that is where the key to the problem lies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has to buy much more of its own produce. Australia is in a trade and export position where about 70 per cent of its primary and resource production is exported. When I see farmers march up Collins Street and Bourke Street mall in Melbourne asking Australians not to buy Californian oranges and to use Australian oranges instead, and using other simplistic equations in respect of stopping imports, they never mention the fact that we sell 70 per cent of our farm produce offshore. Other countries buy that produce and they, in turn, expect Australia to buy their products. So any reversion to the old Black Jack McEwen idea of putting up the barriers strikes directly at the heart of the very people whom we are trying to help. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not sufficient for the National Farmers Federation to argue that we should not encourage downstream processing in Australia because it is likely to threaten existing markets. The long term future for producers lies in much more development of these facilities and options in Australia so that they grow and produce much more predominantly for an Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate: this has been a very difficult process for the Government. As a member of the country task force established by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I know many of us spent hours and hours over the last year travelling around Australia talking with producers from all sectors to try to resolve these problems in international trade. We all know that Australia is a principal victim of the trade policies of Europe and the United States of America. I have long supported the idea of trying to find ourselves an international cartel. Even the comments by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) in response to the current activities in the USA have led us to examine ways of finding our own trading bloc, because if the behaviour towards Australia in these trade situations is not resolved and the Uruguay Round is not resurrected, Australian producers will continue to be exposed in an unfair way which will adversely affect not only Australia's producers but the whole population. We have a responsibility to look at some other options. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. Rather than being a temporary provision, the Bill represents a shift to a new era for the wool industry. Those conditions which prevailed when the first decision was made still prevail. The product is still the best in the world. It does have a position in the international marketplace, but the best way for the situation to be resolved is for the wool growers and the industry to completely take over the marketing and dissemination of the product. </PARA>

However, I rise today to put my thoughts forward in the best interests of the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia will undoubtedly always be a major supplier of the world's apparel wool. Australia supplies 80 per cent of the apparel wool to our consuming countries. That fact must be kept firmly in our sights in the debate and during the agony that will confront the industry in the next two to three years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems the wool industry faces is the supply of wool at predictable prices. For many months I have asked myself whether price, product supply or the world recession affects our consumers. Another scenario is that perhaps we have lost market share to other fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think it is worth relaying to the House a point that I have been able to glean from a comment made by one of our major consumers of wool in western Europe: there is no way to properly run a farm, a combing mill, a spinning mill, a weaving mill or a knitting mill with strong price variations and with an acceptable risk profile without any hedging tool. The present situation stimulates and increases the use of other fibre alternatives. I really believe that says a lot and that it is one of the things the industry must look at, important factors relating to any commodity being predictability of prices, stability, and continuity of supply. I think we must also look very clearly at future marketing initiatives for wool, and we must certainly guard against any of the corrupt trading cartels which are out there in the world-and I think it is naive for anyone to believe that there are not corrupt trading practices out there. If we did have a free trade system it would be wonderful, but it is fairyland stuff to believe that such a situation exists now. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not underestimate the problem that this Parliament and the industry face because, when I was first married back in 1967, I walked straight into a wool recession which lasted for five years. I well remember the people who shore their sheep themselves to survive-they no longer employed shearers. I well remember the people who took their monthly accounts to their agents or their banks for payment-they did not have a cheque book. I certainly remember the heartbreak of families and individuals who were forced off the land because of that recession. I also remember the towns that lost a population, and a younger generation which moved to the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate alone, I have many towns that I know are going to feel the pain of what is in front of the industry. I have many towns in my electorate which are called shearers' towns, and I believe they are going to be very badly affected. I guess one of the things that I worry about is that we will lose shearers from the industry, so as we do come out of this cycle-and inevitably we will-we must ensure that we have people in there, the infrastructure, to continue on as we get over the hard times in front of us. I have been involved in the wool industry for all my married life and, in fact, all my working life. It is certainly the industry that has fed and clothed my family and my family before me. </PARA>

If we look at some of the roles of the Corporation, we see it has been out there training shearers and establishing shearer training schools. The industry has taxed itself to train its shearers. The industry has taxed itself to train its wool classers. It has taxed itself to ensure it has classers who are registered. It has a clip inspection service which ensures the product that we put on the world markets is of the highest possible quality and standard, and of a predictable standard. That is just one of the roles that the Wool Corporation has played. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the industry has taken a leading role in the training of the required staff for the needs of the industry. There is a requirement also to type our varieties of wool and to ensure that these varieties are in fact consistent with our buyers' requirements. There are some 200-odd prime types, and if we go through all of these subsidiary types there are something like 6,000 to 7,000 types. I think it probably does people no credit to say that we have to sell the Australian Wool Corporation and scuttle its assets just in order to pay its debts. I find it, as I said earlier, an act of vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA> But when it comes to forecasting, I have always had a problem with the predictions of ABARE. I suppose it is down here in Canberra in this rare air and perhaps we should say, well, it has all the information available; it should be able to predict accurately what is going to happen in two, three or four years hence. I just want to record here today its predictions in January of 1989 to show how wrong it can be. It was predicting in 1990 that the market indicator would average 1,055c for the year in 1989. It said that in 1991 the average market indicator would be 1,080c and that we would have 20,000 bales in stockpile. Within six months of its prediction, the Wool Corporation had 2.5 million bales in stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> So I question the relevance of ABARE if it can be that inaccurate. I think we must look at the economic models it uses, and inform it that it needs urgently to address its organisation and situation. Whilst there is a lot of criticism being levelled-and rightly so-at the industry organisations and the Australian Wool Corporation, we do not want to forget ABARE because it has something like 280 employees down there and costs us $16m to run. If the best that it can come up with are predictions like that, it would be better just writing history because I think all it has been able to do is record history. Perhaps it might be better off selling pencils and rubbers with the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am sure it will not, as the honourable member for Dawson says. But there was a warning given back in 1988 by the then retiring full time chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, David Asimus. In May 1988, when prices had taken off-they were at 1,240c a kilogram-he said that consumer reaction to current wool prices was inevitable. He said that the first impact of consumer reaction to the recent wool prices would be felt in the spring of 1989. He was right. He said that it is impossible to estimate the extent to which consumers will be frightened out of the market. He went on to say that the floor price must be set at a level which would never have to be lowered. Unfortunately it was lowered and perhaps we could all hypothesise now and say that it is one of the reasons we are now in the position we are in today. He predicted that back in 1988, so there were people urging caution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further point I would like to make is that he was the full time Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation about to retire and be replaced by a part time Chairman. In other words the Minister, in what we might say was his wisdom or lack of it, downgraded the position of Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation to a part time position. I would say with hindsight the Minister would say that that in fact was a dreadful mistake which will have to be corrected. I think an industry such as the wool industry, as important as it is, really does need someone full time on the job and not just part time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things I want to touch on is our international reputation as a result of what has happened in the last four months, and the Minister's word that the price was immutable. It is not just going to affect our wool industry; it is going to affect our beef industry, our wheat industry and all our export industries in which the Minister is involved. The Minister went around the world at the end of last year and assured buyers that the price was immutable. I checked with the Oxford dictionary-I thought I was right, and I am-and it says that immutable means unchangeable, not subject to variation. That did not last long. </PARA>
<PARA> The international world will never trust Australia whilst we have a Minister who says one thing and four months later goes back on his word. It will damage our reputation internationally for a long time. There are people out in the community who took the Minister at his word; there are processors who took the Minister at his word; there are banks who took the Minister at his word; and there are people out there in the bush who took the Minister at his word and made investment decisions based on that word. I was brought up to believe that `My word is my bond'. I hope somewhere in life we still have people who say what they mean and will stick to their word. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch briefly on the deficiency payments, because the Government is offering the industry $300m for a deficiency payment; it is calling on the industry to fund an open cheque. That is ludicrous. All that will do is add debt to the wool growers which eventually has to be repaid. I support the amendment that we on this side of the House have moved. To have wool growers fund an open cheque at a time when they can ill afford it, when we are facing the bleakest period since the 1970s, is just crazy. To add debt that has to be repaid to an industry has no sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if the Government is fair dinkum it should have a greater commitment to this issue. These deficiency payments should not be paid as the sales progress but paid at the end of June and dividends should be then processed and sent to wool growers at the end of the selling season. Clearly, there is no incentive between now and June, if the deficiency payments are paid as they go along, for growers to set a reserve price on their wool. They will say, `If I am going to get 700c, I will let it go.' I think we must give them incentives to hold wool back off the market if they, in their best judgment, think they may be able to get a higher price for it. I think the deficiency payment or supplementary payment, whatever one wants to call it, should not be offered to them until the end of June. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area I want to talk about is the area of private buyers. I fear that if we do not watch this supplementary payment the private buyers will be out buying wool. There is room for types to be quoted differently. That is where the Australian Wool Corporation comes in. If a deficiency payment is to be made, we need an independent authority which can type those wools. Perhaps the only way around this is to submit all wool through auction. We have a situation where wool could be bought privately in western Queensland and shipped straight to Adelaide or wherever, and it will by-pass an independent authority to type that wool in order that it can receive a supplementary or deficiency payment. Perhaps the only solution is to put between now and June all wool through the auction. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the stockpile has got out of control. It certainly has the potential to depress the market. I believe that this matter must remain in the hands of the industry. We need a firm policy on the stockpile which will allow wool onto the market. Although there may be some merit in freezing the market and releasing wool at a predictable rate, I think every endeavour must now be made and every stop pulled out to see whether we can get Russia and China back into our wool market. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we may freeze our market, the New Zealanders will not freeze their 650,000 bale stockpile. That wool could well be sold to China and Russia, and New Zealand would grab the market share which we need vitally and should be getting. We must watch the situation very closely and make every effort to sell our wool and bring China and Russia back into the market. The Minister travelled there at the end of last year, and efforts must be stepped up to see whether we can get those two countries back into the market, because they are clearly a key to getting a greater quantity of wool onto the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is running out and there is a lot more I would have liked to have said. We must wait to see what the Vines committee of inquiry has to say on future marketing arrangements. It may come forward with suggestions for a new marketing scheme that will be acceptable to wool growers. There is clearly a need to be able to sell wool on a 365 days a year basis instead of the present 42-week selling period. There is a need for a more forward contract selling system. There is a need to promote Australian wool as opposed to overseas wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the slaughter scheme is concerned, I would like to see a whole lot more done in the area of live sheep trade. To that end, I would like to see a former member of this House, Doug Anthony, called on to travel to the Middle East to see whether he can re-establish a viable live sheep trade with the Middle East. It is crazy to put sheep into pits when in 1983 we were able to sell seven million sheep to the Middle East. What a tragic waste of resources it would be if we did not pursue every effort to get the live sheep trade operational again. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the amendment of the Opposition on deficiency payments. I believe it goes a long way towards addressing the real problems of grower equity. It is not good enough to add debt to wool growers by way of deficiency payments, as proposed by the Government. I have reservations about the abolition of the reserve price scheme prior to the release of the report of the Vines committee of inquiry, but I firmly believe that next week we must recommence wool auctions. It is vital that we get wool back onto our processing pipeline and that we recom- mence sales next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill is probably the most important piece of legislation we have had in this Parliament. It is interesting to see that there are only two lonely people in the press gallery for this debate. I want to say a few things about the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I share an electoral boundary with the honourable member for O'Connor and I have supported him in his electorate and said that he was one of the very few in the Liberal Party of Australia who was telling the story of wool as it should be told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had members in his own constituency say to me, `Poor Wilson; he has told me they would not let him speak in the debate'. Yet he comes into the House today and tells us that it was as a result of a gag. The truth is that the Liberal Party would not let him speak because it did not like what he had to say. What he had to say today was a mishmash of half truths. It certainly did him no credit. I will certainly be distributing his speech through his own electorate. He tried to blame the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for what was clearly the responsibility of the Australian Wool Corporation. If the honourable member for O'Connor does not understand that, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the wool growers in his electorate do. They recognise that it was the Wool Council of Australia and the Wool Corporation that made those crazy decisions. I am amazed at the loyalty of Minister Kerin who in his heart must have known they were embarking on a crazy course but defended the scheme up until it had to be scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA> I address another piece of nonsense that was mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the National Party and shadow Minister for Primary Industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), that I had somehow or other helped to destroy confidence in the wool market by distributing a letter. I have a copy of that letter here. I listened with interest to the speech of the shadow Minister as he trudged his turgid way down his own road to Damascus. This letter does not mention one thing about not buying Australian wool. I sent the letter to the technical media in Europe because I thought it was important that they should know what was happening in Australia. I thought it was important to stress to them that they should understand what was happening amongst growers. </PARA>
<PARA> They, too, like the Australian wool growers, were subjected to an enormous amount of misinformation. Do not let hearts bleed for the Japanese, because I can tell honourable members that the Japanese know exactly what is happening in Australia, and the Japanese-while they protest-will not be caught at all. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I seek leave to table this letter so it is clearly shown-contrary to the lies of Mr Beggs and every other agro-political organisation in Australia, with the honourable exception of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association in Western Australia-that I at no stage told people not to buy Australian wool. My efforts were always constructively designed to help the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I must say the contribution of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) was woolly, to say the least. It was a rambling contribution, and I think if the honourable member had had all day he would not have said much. There are a couple of points I do want to take up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At no stage during 1989 did the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) say the indicator would be over 1,000c. It was in fact much more pessimistic than that. What the Australian Wool Corporation usually says, when defending itself against charges of not listening to ABARE, is, `Oh, in 1987 ABARE said there would be a decline in the price of wool'. And it did: it got it wrong. It got it wrong for the same reason the Wool Corporation got it wrong: it did not realise that China was going to disintegrate. It did not realise that China was going to go from a central wool buying system to a decentralised one where buyers were competing against each other and buying lines that they did not need. ABARE could not predict that, nor could the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that when the Wool Corporation moved its indicator to 870c, all the other experts in this field-in both the private and the public sectors-were saying, `Do not do it; the market has turned'. That is not denied by the Wool Corporation. It has actually said to me, `We have to trust our judgment'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also mentioned David Asimus. Now I would like to mention David Asimus too. David Asimus was the man who actually cut back funding for promotion in wool, preferring to rely on the floor price. When the price was raised to 870c it was Asimus who wanted to put it to 1,000c. I think David Asimus's contribution to the wool industry has been abysmal, and I certainly want that on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few more. We have 20 people speaking on this Bill here today. The silence coming from the Opposition has been deafening. The National Party, with the honourable exception of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who got this right from the start, has been very solid. It has been going down the road of supporting the dishonest, deceitful Wool Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just talk about research and development, because I do not agree with the Government increasing funds for research and development. The truth is that there is very little research and development of any value coming out of this country in respect of wool. There is far more coming out of the mills in Europe at no cost to the Australian growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look where we are going with research and development. I remember 20 years ago when the Abel Star handpiece was developed. It was going to solve the second cuts in wool. As everyone knows, most second cuts come with the extension of the long blow when the down tube is dragging the handpiece out of the wool. Twenty years ago the Wool Corporation touted this as a great innovation. It was going to save the industry something like $15m-probably $150m today. What happened to it? It got buried because the Australian Wool Corporation tried to get its own friends in the Sunbeam Corporation to produce it instead of the company in Western Australia. Sunbeam was never able to do it, so that innovation-I believe one of the best-never hit the market. That company struggles on. That innovation makes shearing much easier, and it is going to be one of the things-when it is fully exploited-that keeps the cap on the increasing price of shearing. But that is what we have got from the Wool Corporation over the years-vested interests and dishonesty and pandering to friends. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with a problem. I am not happy about this particular piece of legislation. The nub of it is this: we are going to enter into a free market system where there is no floor in the price of wool, where we are likely to have a very large rush of wool to the market because I believe it is going to be very difficult to stop people shearing before June, and certainly it is going to be a lot harder than has been indicated to me by members of the Opposition. There will still be playing in the field, muddying the water, the Australian Wool Corporation. So there is uncertainty in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we have had no futures market-and there cannot be a futures market where there is a floor-no-one really knows what the price is. So all those uncertainty factors are present. There is no doubt the auction system will set the price, but it will do it in a very bloody fashion. I believe it would have been far better to delay wool sales until we get a futures market going so we can get some guidelines for price. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say in respect of price that we have had the Wool Corporation touting its figure, saying, `Oh, it will go to 200c' and that wool is finished for five to seven years. This is coming out of the Minister's own Department. I say to this House, to this country and to the wool growers of this country that there is no validity in those figures; they are as good as any plucked out of the air. I believe the indications coming out of Europe are that prices will be substantially better than this and, if markets can be increased, I believe that we could get back on track inside 12 months-back on the indicator line with the present 700c indicator. The Minister, who uses Andy Stoeckel's figures, will say the indicator line is 665c. My calculations are that it is in fact 695c. Whatever it is, it is not substantially worse than the present floor price, but substantially better than the prices that are being predicted. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no reason why wool should not return to its long term position of about 2 1/2 times the price of cotton. The only thing that will stop this is uncertainty in the market, and the fact that the Wool Corporation has allowed wool to be substituted. This substitution took place the very second that wool hit 870c on the way down. We are going to have to buy that market back, and buy it back with cheap wool. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by the Wool Corporation that the demand for 21-25 micron wool is simply not there. I believe this is a nonsense. I believe this is the backbone of the Australian wool industry, and we are going to have to find markets for this. I can tell the Minister and honourable members opposite that there will be a hell of a lot more 19-micron wool on the market next year. There are a lot of people in Australia with the capacity to starve two microns off their sheep, and they will do it. We will see what that does to the price of 19 micron wool. Quite clearly, the wool that is being bought in substitution from South America, South Africa and New Zealand is not much better than 25 microns-probably a lot worse. So it is nonsense to say that the demand for such wool is not there. I believe the Wool Corporation has made a fetish of microns, and the people I speak with in the trade tell me that length, strength and texture or feel are much better and much more important than simply a micron measurement. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to have to look at marketing because it has been a dismal failure. Something like $200m a year has gone into marketing for a continued loss of market share. It is an indictment. Zenna Ernenegildo in Italy, which makes very fine worsted material- the sort of material that gives one that Keating look-refuses to use Woolmark because it says it detracts from the quality of its product. Anything that uses pure wool can use the Woolmark. Zenna Ernenegildo says that its quality of wool is better than that. Zenna Baraussa, on the other hand, succumbed to a bribe from the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) and accepts $75,000 a year to use the Woolmark. It has nothing to do with promotion-it is thinly disguised as an advertising subsidy. It is simply a bribe which the IWS gives these people so it can come back to Australian growers and say, `Look, we have got these high class people to use it'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that of the 19-odd companies producing high fashion, high quality knitted goods on the English-Scottish border only one uses Woolmark, and that by default. They have not succumbed to offers from the IWS to be paid to use the Woolmark. We have a lot of questions to answer about marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe one of the great tragedies is the blend market. Back in 1973, when I was a wool grower, we were told the United States was the biggest per capita user of fibre in the world. It was the smallest per capita user of wool. Twenty years and $200m a year later it is exactly the same. Nothing has changed. We have to get into the blend market, because that blend market will absorb a lot of that wool which the Wool Corporation says will not sell. I believe that with initiative we can do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to set about getting stability back into the stockpile. I have consistently maintained that the Government should buy the stockpile. I believe this because nobody but the Government can stabilise it; nobody trusts us with the Wool Corporation. Had the gutless individuals opposite come in here with a motion that the Government acquire the stockpile, they would have seriously embarrassed me because it would have been difficult not to have voted for it. But they did not have the nerve to do that. </PARA>

<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition has done nothing. It has simply applied another $200m. I believe that the Wool Corporation should be swept away. The Minister says that he was concerned that the members of the board of the Corporation did not resign and leave the Corporation without any management structure. I think it would be a terrible pity if members of the board resigned before we could sack them. Getting rid of the board does not get rid of the structure of the Corporation. That would go on. I believe that Jim Young is a good technician. He does understand what needs to be done and would probably function better if he was under the instruction of a receiver rather than a board which does not seem to know what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that we as a Government have a responsibility because we did not stop the price being put to 870c and that was the cause of our dilemma. We do have a responsibility. The cheapest option for the taxpayer is to buy the stockpile now. There is no reason to doubt, although nobody really knows, that if the stockpile were bought now wool would be back on the trend line in 12 months and we could actually make money on it. In any case, the loss would not be all that great. I would support the price of wool until 30 June by selling the Corporation's assets. It would require an advance from the Department of Finance but I think we should sell the Corporation's assets. I am certainly rather taken to the idea of paying out the additional sum at the end of June when it has been averaged out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has come in here with a very small amendment, one which I certainly would not support because it is meaningless. It certainly does nothing for the industry. We have to make a level playing field for the merchants. We have to assure the merchants that never again will the Wool Corporation be able to get in there and compete with them. How can one compete with a corporation that has lost $1.2 billion of growers money? When it has that sort of money to play with it is no good to stockpile the wool. It has been sunk and lost. How can anyone compete on those terms? We have to let the trade know that never again will that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to develop immediately, as I said earlier, subsidiary instruments such as the futures market. We have to establish around the futures market things like the options. Options need a buyer and a seller. They work on a catalyst model called the Black and Scholes pricing equation. It enables long term positions to be taken up where it is possible to work in the actual physical market and in the futures market. It enables people to cushion themselves against buying mistakes and against futures variations. It is an essential component. These are the sorts of things that cannot work where we have a Wool Corporation and a floor price. These things must be done and I would urge the Minister to do everything possible to make sure that they are done as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time left to me I wish to touch on something the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said about the wool scour in Western Australia. He was talking about Australian wool processors. They have built without a doubt the most modern, technically advanced wool scour in the world. It is one of only seven. It uses a de smitt process. It is true that Michael Hodgson put $9m of his own money into this venture, a very gutsy decision. It is true that he got caught up by the Wool Corporation putting in the 870c price and no wool being available. It is also true that his bank has not had the courage that in my view it should have had, but then that is the history of banks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation has not supported his scour. As it was supporting scours all over Australia, I wrote asking whether it could support him. It wrote back and said, `Oh, no, it's a situation where they entered this on their own initiative and they have an inferior product'. That rather took me back. I then went to the Wool Corporation's technical people and asked them to assess the product. They told me that it was an absolutely top product, one of the best in the world, the best they had seen. In many cases, they thought it was superior to the aqueous system. </PARA>
<PARA> I then got back in touch with the Wool Corporation which restated its belief that it was an inferior product. I asked what the Corporation thought of its technical people and of course I was told that they were excellent. I then faxed the Corporation a letter from its technical people. I heard that its technical people got into some trouble over this. This is the sort of thing we have had to put up with from the Wool Corporation. I believe that Australian wool processors have an action against the Wool Corporation and they should pursue it. The Wool Corporation has sabotaged a very valuable asset to Australia that will probably fall into foreign hands for a song. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a wool industry in this country we have to look not at an ever decreasing amount of wool but increasing amounts of wool. The fibre market has increased dramatically over the last few years. The amount of cotton sold has increased. The amount of silk sold has increased. Only wool has declined. People say, `But you couldn't predict Russia'. Russia has continued to use cotton in quite large volumes, as has China. We have had a marketing stuff-up of enormous proportions. It has been a very expensive marketing debacle. It has been paid for by the Australian wool producers and they deserve better. But they have been kept in ignorance by the Wool Corporation. The Wool Corporation has made a fetish of faith-one must have faith! Some of it we heard from the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). We have heard no facts. The Corporation has denied facts to the industry. The industry has been kept in darkness. </PARA>
<PARA> My office actually photocopied 800 copies of the Stoeckel report-we breached his copyright-and sent them out to growers. Growers told me that it is the only information they ever had. I think Stoeckel's statistical stuff is very good. His marketing stuff is off-beam. It is an academic assessment; it is not in the real world. The rest of it is excellent material. I know that the many growers we sent this report to were very grateful to get it because, as they said, it was the first time they had ever had any information on the industry.</PARA>

The reserve price scheme, as we have known it for a long time, is over. I believe it is a sad fact but, nevertheless, it is a fact.

<PARA>The Corporation shall, at fortnightly intervals, make reports to the Minister and the Treasurer concerning the operation of its reserve price scheme, and shall include in the reports such information as the Minister directs concerning-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the reserve prices determined by the Corporation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) wool purchased and wool held by the Corporation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) sales of wool by the Corporation and proposed offerings of wool by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> There was in those early days a great attempt by government to make sure that the checks and balances were in the system. In 1987 those checks and balances were taken out to the point where we have the present debacle. I am not one who is critical of all the moves that this Government has made since it became apparent that the reserve price scheme was in trouble, but I believe that that was the turning point; that was the mistake, that was the point at which the checks and balances became ineffective-in fact, ceased to exist. That system allowed the industry effectively to set its own reserve price, leaving it taxing powers and borrowing powers. That changed the floor price system, which was a base price below which we would sell to no-one, to an aggressive reserve price scheme which finally failed. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the minimum reserve price . . . had become an instrument for chasing the market. </PARA>
<PARA>How did that come about? If the Minister had not changed the legislation in 1987, it would not have come about. I leave honourable members with that thought, because I think it is something that is often overlooked when people are looking at where the responsibility for this action lies. The responsibility may not lie so much in the actions that were taken up until this latest piece of legislation; if we want to find the fault, we can look right into the centre of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that the Government take notice of the reservations that the Opposition has about this piece of legislation; they have been outlined by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and others. I would specifically like to draw the Minister's attention to two matters. Mr Beggs, in November, said that the most urgent problem faced by the Australian wool industry is to bring supply back in line with demand. Last June and July, after the reserve price was dropped to 700c, many of us on this side of the House looked long and deep at what was possible to actually bring about this equalising of the supply and demand equation. We had heard from some members of the Corporation that they were going to sell a lot more wool to America, which has not happened, and that the situation was looking optimistic in Russia, which has not happened. We had not heard from them that China was in recession at that point, nevertheless we knew that, whatever the demand side of the equation, we could not fix it instantly. That has been proven ever since, but anybody who knows anything about these industries knows there is no quick fix for demand-side problems and usually no quick fix for supply-side problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of looking at that, we came up with a solution to part of the supply-side problem, which was a very unattractive slaughter scheme. After some time, the Corporation was persuaded to employ a consultant to look into a slaughter scheme. It is worth reading a couple of paragraphs from that consultants' report to the Corporation-a report that, I might say, has stayed buried somewhere in the archives of the Corporation for most of the last four or five months. The consultants said:</PARA>
<PARA>It goes without saying that even the consideration of such a scheme is unprecedented in the wool industry. The notion of destroying millions of sheep, particularly young and otherwise productive sheep, is anathema to the majority of woolgrowers and indeed other Australians. It is simply a measure of the parlous state of the industry at present and in prospect. </PARA>
<PARA>They knew the horror of what they were proposing. But they then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is ACIL's judgment-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the consultants' judgment-</PARA>
<PARA>that a flock reduction scheme provides the wool industry with its best, and probably its last, hope of retaining 20 years of investment in wool marketing via the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight the Opposition has been accused to some extent-and it was accused the other day in a matter of public importance-of not contributing to this debate. However, it has also been said that we have taken a somewhat bipartisan view on the matter of this whole problem. That is true. We supported the Government in its reduction of the floor price; we supported the Government in its 20 per cent levy. We did not support the Government, I have to say, on its quota scheme, because we knew that those in the industry would not pick it up and would not like it-and they did not. We knew that it would not work. That scheme, of course, has gone out the window very quickly. And we did not support the 50 per cent levy. But we supported the major thrust of other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, when we said to the Government, `Listen, you have to get the supply side under control', it took not the slightest notice. Admittedly, the Wool Corporation, after much twisting and turning, brought in what we could only describe as a half-assed scheme. It offered growers $1.80 for some old sheep and $6 for some young sheep, then changed it under a different contract-quite cleverly, I think-and offered them $5 the next time. That contract is still running. I understand that as of this afternoon it is the Corporation's view that 10 million sheep will be signed up for disposal or sale to the trade under that scheme. Whether it is true or not that all 10 million sheep finally disappear, the fact of the matter is that to get 10 million sheep out for an average cost of $3.70 is quite a surprising result. In fact, it is a very good result. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that, in the second reading speech and other press releases made by the Minister surrounding this piece of legislation, it seems as though any further scheme will go. With descriptions of such schemes as being silver bullet schemes, with criticism of them because of the public relations effect in European newspapers, and with the problem of animal liberation and so on, some people, even on our side, have problems with the scheme. But other things much worse are happening in the world, especially in the Middle East, and I do not think that anybody is focusing too much on whether we get rid of 10 million sheep or 30 million sheep. I ask the Minister-I almost drop my dignity to the point of pleading with him-to get somebody to look at the possibility of using some of this money to make a final offer to wool growers at $8 to $10 apiece to get another 20 million sheep out. If it fails, the Government has not spent a cent; if it succeeds, it will certainly make a difference to the supply side of the equation coming up to the next selling season and to some extent thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of the deficiency payment. The way this deficiency payment is structured in this Bill is open ended. This has been mentioned several times already today. It could mean an extra $700m of debt added to the debt already owed by the Australian Wool Corporation on behalf of growers. We do not know; we have no idea where the market will be. But we know that there is no incentive under this scheme as we have presently seen it-although I understand that a few documents, marks 1, 2 and 3, were floating around during the weekend, and no doubt there will be some more-to attempt to influence growers to put some reserve on themselves, which, as people will know, has been in the past, and to some extent still is, even under the reserve price scheme, a part of the marketing system. Growers quite often put reserves on various lots of wool; it is something that they should be able to do if they want to, as well as using other systems. </PARA>
<PARA> But under this scheme, as initially announced, there is no incentive-or there has not been up until now-for a grower to do other than to throw his wool on the market, knowing that the difference between what it makes and 700c will be made up by the Government. Under that scheme, if it is true that we have 2 1/2 million bales to come in this four months in a historical market of 1 1/2 million bales, it seems to me and many other onlookers that it may well be that the deficiency is somewhere around $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Okay, the Government is throwing in $300m. I have no conscience about that because the Government has a lot of wool growers' tax money. Having taken the income equalisation deposit scheme away some time ago and being clever enough to put it back after the end of the financial year 1989-90-another $6 billion wool year-it has plenty of potential IED money that could be being redeemed by growers this year had that scheme not been removed for, in my view, all the wrong reasons. So $300m would be much more than covered. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the calculations-admittedly amateur because they necessarily have to be-would show that $500m could possibly have gone into IEDs in the last two financial years, 1988-89 and 1989-90. We will never know that, but I have no conscience about the Government throwing $300m into this deficiency payment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> But what I do have a problem with is that, as it appears up until now to be open-ended, perhaps another $400m, $500m, $600m or $700m will be added to the $2.8 billion of debt-or at least the Minister seemed to think so because he announced in his press release that he wanted to increase the borrowing limits to $3.5 billion-and this will increase the growers' debt from $2.8 billion to perhaps $3.5 billion with no further collateral, nothing else, to sell. </PARA>
<PARA> As was described earlier by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), where it might have been a reasonable equation to forgo the $1.7 billion or $1.8 billion of growers' equity in the fund so as to leave the external debt at $2.8 billion and then to try to work one's way through the sale of the product, the 4.8 million bales, making sure in the process that it is locked up for a determined period-we are suggesting at least a year; and then after that the arrangements would be very transparent so that nobody would think the wool was going out through the back door-it seems to me that if we do that and the debt gets to $3.5 billion we will have a much greater chance of sinking that scheme as well. Not to exaggerate the point, it seems to me that this system of a deficiency payment with no bottom to it and a semi-infinite capacity to increase the debts of the Corporation is very unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, many people-in the Government, in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and in other places-have known for the last four months that there was a fair chance that this scheme would go. It must have been possible in that time to think up some sort of a system whereby the growers at least were encouraged to put a reserve price on their wool. That and the original problem of extra debts sinking the market support fund are the only reasons why we have suggested that the Government cap this debt. It must cap the debt. We could have picked a dollar figure, but what is important is that it cap the debt because otherwise it seems that-with no further collateral; nothing else to sell; no further wool-it is making it nearly impossible for the Corporation to get out from under that financial burden. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a little while ago that it is terribly important that the arrangements for the disposal of the stockpile be transparent. There have been so many rumours around that people really do not trust the Australian wool industry in its totality any more. The only way that we can deal with that problem is to make it completely open. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I was in favour of the reserve price scheme. In fact I was an avid supporter of it. I have come to the conclusion however that the antics of the last two years by us all on this side of the water have meant that it will be impossible to get the purchasing side of this industry to trust us again. So what we have always been told will happen in the classical theory of cartels has come about; that is, they work for a while until human beings mess them up. We have finally made that come true, and it is very sad for me and many people in the industry that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make one final plea: I ask the Minister to think about the supply side of this problem, knowing that the demand side will be slow to recover. I know that there are proposals to put wool into China and Russia. I know that we have marketing people going around the world looking at all those things. They may happen. But, if we do not get rid of the supply side problem, solutions to the demand side problem can be as good as we like but the overall problem will take several extra years to solve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a wool growing constituency. Indeed, the last time I spoke in this House on this matter I was criticised by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) because I dared to say at that time that perhaps not only did we have to consider the supply side problems, which have been outlined by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), but also it was very important that consideration be given to demand and that in previous debates perhaps we were not considering that enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do have an interest of course because my brother is a wool grower-a somewhat misguided one I might say; he is a member of the National Party of Australia. But I must say that he is a sincere and hardworking farmer, and this situation is a serious one. I became involved in the debate because I realised the importance of wool to our economy and to Australia. I believed that it was something that one should get a handle on. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard today some monumental hypocrisy from honourable members on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Barker said that he was sad to see the demise of the floor price scheme. He quite rightly pointed out that this problem probably began when the Wool Corporation started to set its own price, when the industry became the voice for wool growers and when those controls which had previously been put in place by the Government were removed and the Corporation began to move in a way which was inconsistent with the market trend for wool not only in Australia but elsewhere. Because of Australia's pre-eminence in the market, that was a very important part of that price equation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) came in here today and said that he would have said what he wanted to say today before but he could not get the opportunity to speak because of the use of the guillotine in the past. He suggested that the issue was too big for politics, but indeed what he came in here to do today was play politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) suggested that it was vandalism on the part of those who considered that the Wool Corporation should be sacked and disbanded. One needs to consider that the way in which this industry has been managed by the Wool Corporation over the last two or three years could be called vandalism. We should also consider the way in which the Corporation has been inconsistent in its treatment of the equation-which we all understand when we talk about markets-in relation to the difference between supply and demand. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last debate the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) talked about the demand side. I must admit that when I heard him speaking in this place I believed he would perhaps say something about price. He talked about tariff changes, production and EFIC-Export Finance and Insurance Corporation-cover for national interest in countries where there were difficulties in paying for the wool, but he was unable to bring himself to say anything about the price of wool. Honourable members on the other side, all of them with wool growing constituencies, stood in a row and to a man were unwilling to say anything about this measure which has become necessary because we have reached the stage where we have to buy back our share in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> There are unforeseen circumstances which have produced this necessity, some of which are beyond our control. What has happened in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China and the circumstances in the Middle East are all things which perhaps could not have been predicted and are certainly outside our control. But it is very clear, I think, that the signals which were sent to farmers by the Wool Corporation-signals that were sent because of the price and the way in which it escalated-led farmers to believe they should increase their supply. That was an important message, and the Corporation has to answer for that. When speaking with my brother about the circumstances in which he found himself, the one thing he continually said was that there was no information provided: the developing circumstances were not explained to farmers and there was no possibility of knowing how things had changed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe, as some others have suggested, that the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill will be temporary legislation. What we see here is a landmark initiative; an initiative which brings about a change in the way that wool will be marketed in the future. I do not believe we will find ourselves going back over the territory of the reserve price scheme because there is no possibility of going back that way. The transition that will occur during the next period when we are trying to sell the surplus wool will be very painful. I believe, whichever way one looks at it, there will not be any simple solution. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came into this place in November and discussed legislative measures to bring about a number of changes relating to an increase in the levy to 25 per cent, a reduction in the reserve price to 700c, flock reductions schemes, borrowing by government and monitoring, we believed that the sums would add up and that if we were able to get an improvement in the sales it would be possible to skate through and for the allocation relating to supply and demand for wool to be rebalanced. There were indications that quotas would be considered as a possibility. But, for a number of reasons, they were widely rejected, and I support that view. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an approach in relation to the slaughtering of sheep in order to reduce the supply side. Indeed, to some extent, I think that there has been some success in that regard. But one wonders about this, because the attitude of many farmers to lower prices is to increase production. Sooner or later in these circumstances-in any circumstances like this-it is necessary to bite the bullet. This legislation-which, as I have already said, I do not believe will be temporary-will change the future of selling wool in this country for as far ahead as we can see. </PARA>
<PARA> Whichever way one looks at it, we have a huge stockpile of wool and it will take some time for that to wash through the system. The messages that will be sent out will be on the demand side because wool will be competing with those other fibres which perhaps can be substituted for wool. The price of wool will also send out messages on the supply side to the farmers who will understand where they should allocate their resources. It is not something that will happen quickly, so we have to expect that there will be some pain. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some reservations about this legislation. I am particularly concerned about the fact that the Australian Wool Corporation at the last minute did an about-face, changed its approach and accepted that it was necessary to remove the floor price scheme. So we find that it is essentially still holding the reins. That causes me some concern. It is a sobering thought, and I am comforted by the fact, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will be in a position to be able to direct and scrutinise the Corporation's activities. But I am concerned that we now find the arsonist in charge of the fire brigade. It is something which I believe we need to watch very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned also about the support scheme-or the deficiency payment scheme-because it is clear that there may be early shearing by farmers and a glut of wool coming on the market as a result of these deficiency payments being available until the end of this financial year. It is a worry that this could cause distortion and, in fact, militate against an appropriate market price being established. </PARA>
<PARA> I think also there are salutary lessons that we should learn from all of this. The first is that cartels, over time, cannot be expected to be successful and that markets must be sensitive to price. We need to contemplate this when we consider other initiatives. I notice in the media that there are discussions about a reserve price for wheat and I believe this experience should be very sobering; it is an experience that should tell us that we cannot contemplate such an approach in respect of that commodity. I think there is a message in this situation and it is pleasing that we find assistance provided for research. Marketing and research are critical if we are to sell our products overseas. Too many Australians, no matter what they are producing, do not allocate resources to marketing and research in a manner which will enable them to be the most efficient sellers of their goods overseas. In respect of wool, when one looks at the size of our share of the American market one can only conclude that our marketing expertise and effort in that country has been a failure. When one looks at the way in which we have been affected by this crisis, it is critical that we look at being more successful in marketing our wool in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The final lesson is clear to all of us who are concerned about industry policy in this country-that is, that we should be considering approaches with regard to processing our wool and selling our product overseas. Many honourable members who have spoken in the debate have mentioned that and many of them have made salient points. The important thing is that finally the bullet has been bitten in respect of wool and the way in which we market wool. This decision is a watershed decision, and it is to be hoped that in the future we will see a stabilisation of a market price which rewards farmers adequately and enables us to sail through this very difficult period so that when we come out on the other side we have a market which provides for wool assurances into the future and provides wool growers with the opportunity to continue to do what they want to do as farmers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Committee met to consider a matter that has arisen in relation to its inquiry into the Australian banking industry. On 7 December 1990, Mr John McLennan, of Port Macquarie, made a detailed submission to the Committee dealing, in particular, with the issue of foreign currency loans. At a meeting last Thursday, the Committee authorised the publication of Mr McLennan's submission and decided to take evidence from him on 20 March next. Yesterday the Committee Secretary received a letter from Mr McLennan, with attachments, which included copies of a summons served on him on Sunday evening. This summons required his attendance before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on Wednesday, 20 February, 1991. According to the summons, inter alia, Mr McLennan is to be examined orally relating to the identity of persons who allegedly provided him with copies of documents belonging to Westpac Banking Corporation. Orders are also sought to restrain Mr McLennan from disclosing or using confidential information contained in certain documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has two particular concerns which it wishes to place before the House and which it asks you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consider. First, the Committee recognises that even if the orders sought in relation to Mr McLennan's future conduct are granted, they cannot, because of the law of parliamentary privilege, expose him to any prosecution in relation to evidence he may give to our Committee. Nevertheless, although this is the correct legal position, it may not be generally understood, and the Committee would be most concerned lest it be felt that a properly constituted parliamentary committee could be constrained in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee has received advice from Mr McLennan to the effect that he believes the service of the subpoena on him is an attempt to intimidate him. This is an issue of privilege, because, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are aware, the House possesses great powers to protect witnesses in respect of their involvement with committee inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> My Committee is naturally very concerned that witnesses involved in this inquiry be protected and that the Committee's ability to conduct a full and thorough investigation into matters falling within its terms of reference is not diminished.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first day of February 1991 was an historic day for the wool industry when the reserve price scheme was over. The Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) suspended sales on that day as credit facilities from the Government had run out. This concluded 25 years of vigorous debate in the wool industry. I declare my interest as a wool grower, having participated in that debate since 1965. In 1965 the wool growers rejected a reserve price scheme. We should remember that fact. Fifty-nine thousand wool growers voted against the scheme and 51,000 voted in favour of a reserve price scheme at that time. Sir William Gunn, who has now appeared out of retirement to defend his scheme, was very vigorous in the debate at that time. During those debates concerns were expressed about the possible outcome if market forces were not obeyed in the selling of wool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go into the history of the scheme. In the 1970s wool prices were very low. A reserve price scheme, having been rejected by growers, was again introduced as a mechanism to help even out the fluctuations of wool prices. With government funds, a reserve price was instituted in October 1970. In 1971 the wool industry reached a very low point in terms of wool prices. In 1972-73 the present reserve price scheme was introduced by the McMahon Government and then later revised by the Whitlam Government. Up until 1988 there were two comparatively minor build-ups of stockpiles-one in 1975-76 and the other in 1985-86. As predicted by earlier critics, this gave confidence to the reserve price scheme operation that these stockpiles could be moved aside with the passage of time. This further added to the confidence of the reserve price scheme protagonists. </PARA>
<PARA> In the boom psychology of 1988-89, when 1,200c clean was the price being received for the better grades of wool, the reserve price was moved from 550c clean to 870c. Political self-interest of the Australian Wool Council in setting a price of a world commodity was very much in evidence when setting this reserve price. The reserve price scheme became an aggressive price setter, not a potholing, low price operation as it was first intended. One of the main causes of this dramatic change was the nexus between the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Political considerations overcame any rational assessment of the long term market trend. One of the problems in setting the reserve price at the high level was that thereafter people said that we could not have an open debate because we would destroy confidence in the wool industry. In my view blame could be sheeted home to a number of growers in New South Wales, who increased their production by 48 per cent and were instrumental in pushing this reserve price to a very high level. Of course, under these circumstances the reserve price scheme broke down. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last week the Chairman of the Wool Corporation has publicly given the following reasons for the reserve price breakdown: the high prices received during the boom times; speculation over the reduction from the 870c to 700c reserve price figures; China going out of the market; record Australian production; the world economy slowing down; and, of course, the movement out of the wool market by the Europeans and the Soviets because they lacked the cash resources to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> In simple terms, the reserve price scheme brought about the situation where wool growers were buying their own product, paying the interest and paying the storage charges on the wool that they bought. In recent months the Wool Corporation has been buying anything from 35 per cent to 70 per cent of the offering. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, on the other hand, gave the reserve price every chance to operate. With great reservations, the coalition supported the change from 870c to 700c. It supported the Government's credit arrangements. It put forward the positive proposal of a flock reduction scheme, and, of course, it threw out the idea of having quotas because it knows that quotas will not work. Unfortunately, the growers were not aware of the big figures, so they were not fully informed on all the arguments about the reserve price at that time. Most growers believed the myth that the reserve price would protect their price from market fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the reserve price is that the supply situation continues and the demand factors send no signals to the wool growers. Good seasons over the last few years have indicated a very strong supply situation, and growers continue to produce, disregarding the true market situation. The cost of the reserve price scheme is considerable: the cost of running the Australian Wool Corporation, the $2.8 billion borrowings, the $1.8 billion of grower funds that have been injected into the scheme, the interest involved, the storage, and the administration. The monopoly of the AWC, of course, under the reserve price scheme meant that there was no futures market indicating trends in the wool market prices. The AWC, under the reserve price scheme, had total control of the system. The political and commercial considerations became confused in any debate about the future of the reserve price scheme. Of course, there were no other options available under these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of marketing wool in 1990, in comparison with the cost of marketing cotton, draws to the House's attention quite a considerable difference. The cost of marketing wool, according to the AWC's own sources, is about 107c greasy compared with 35c per kilogram LNT for cotton. The costs are incorporated in shipping, buying, research and development, and taxes. Of course, in regard to wool, taxes move from 8 per cent to 18 per cent to 25 per cent, with the statutory possibility of up to a 40 per cent tax in order to look after the wool industry, if that can be construed as being of any help. Other costs involve selling charges, warehousing and transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Innovative marketing arrangements were not encouraged. There was no incentive to change the process because all these arrangements under the reserve price scheme and the monopoly position of the AWC were very cosy. The AWC was not flexible in responding to any price signals because of the considerable political pressures in the field. The Wool Council of Australia, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the National Farmers Federation and the growers in everyone's electorates were dealing with the myths of the reserve price. No real figures were available, as I said, because everyone was concerned that any real debate about the reserve price might destroy this mythical confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the risks were all taken by the growers. They had the stockpile; they were paying the costs involved. The risks of the whole wool chain were not spread down the line. I refer, for example, to the exchange rate. There were also risks and incentives required for processors to upgrade their equipment. The wool growers took it upon themselves to look after the buffer stocks or the total wool scheme and moved it away from other people in the wool chain, which was so important. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the fact that the reserve price scheme is finished; it is not just suspended. Anyone in the wool industry fully understands that. I do not understand why the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is suggesting that it is just suspended in a temporary manner. The stockpile is now standing at 4.8 million bales. The great problem facing the wool industry is what to do with the stockpile. I suggest that it be frozen for a year; that there be a selling program on a predictable basis; that the basis be clear and transparent so that buyers throughout the world can understand exactly what is happening to the stockpile. Maybe this should be incorporated in legislation so that buyers can have confidence. The stockpile should be drip fed on to the market at a predictable rate to be determined after the next three or four months, when we can see what might happen to the market. That will be a very difficult commercial operation. I do not think woolgrowers underestimate that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problems facing the stockpile are the massive problem of storage and, of course, the interest payments on the money involved. Another problem that is facing the wool industry is the fact that we are now half way through the next production year, with another big wool clip coming forward to be sold in the current season. That will provide storage difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The debt which other honourable members have referred to of $2.8 billion, which is government guaranteed, is the amount of money that the Australian Wool Corporation has borrowed so that it can continue the operation of the floor price scheme. Obviously, that amount has been borrowed at commercial rates by the AWC, but enjoying the government guarantee arrangements. It should be noted that the growers have contributed $1.8 billion to the purchase of the stockpile. Most growers, the AWC and commentators agree that these growers' funds have now dissipated into the reserve price scheme and will never be seen again. The total debt will probably reach about $3 billion, depending on one's guess. I draw to the attention of the House and all wool growers around Australia that, at an interest rate of 14 per cent, future wool growers will be up for $420m per annum in servicing that debt. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the deficiency payments which the Minister is trying to bring forward in terms of equity-and the coalition supports that view-the Government has put forward $300m to contribute to the deficiency payment scheme. In my view, this is a de facto reserve price mechanism. The total payments could reach $700m, $800m or $900m, depending on what the price of wool is in the open market. Of course, in this situation there is no wool in a stockpile as collateral for this extra payment of debt either by the Corporation or by the Government. Because of the change of rosters in the wool selling season, we have 2 1/2 million bales to be sold when the market is for about 1 1/2 million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan put forward by the Minister brings forward no firm policy. The deficiency payment that I have just referred to could easily be overspent, depending on the prices that emerge. The stockpile dissipation arrangements are not clear and that stockpile figure overhangs the market. The buyers will now operate in the open market, with no clear criteria as to the way in which they might place their valuations next week. </PARA>
<PARA> The great pain and suffering of wool growers in the short term has been caused by the overoptimistic reserve price. We will be reviewing this situation in June. There are always difficulties, when we move from a controlled market situation to a free market, in the transition period. We saw that in the tin industry around the world when it reached a similar situation to that of the wool industry. It had a monopoly position and it overdid it. We also saw this in regard to the egg quotas in New South Wales, where the Greiner Government had to buy out the producers at, I think, $60m. With regard to the fresh milk quotas in Victoria and New South Wales, when they moved from a restricted market situation to an open market, it cost the governments a lot of money. Likewise, when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel changed from a monopoly position to a free market it caused a great amount of pain amongst producers who thought they could hold the market to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> A return to free and open market competition is the only strategy for the survival of the wool industry in the long term. The sooner the Government, the AWC and wool growers around Australia understand that and adopt that strategy, the sooner the Australian wool industry will return to profitability and prosperity for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a wool grower, I declare my interest in this legislation. I also declare my concern for all those wool growers in Australia who henceforth will have their income more than halved as a result of the downturn in the market and the successive measures which this Government has either taken or failed to take over the last few years. I know that many see the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill as almost inevitable. I do not. I think for a long while the Government has looked to excess at the arithmetic of a scheme which has more and more looked into itself. Any scheme which is going to acquire a product and not let that product go out to the marketplace must fail. My worry has been that, with regard to the arithmetic of trying to maintain the successive minimum reserve price (MRP) at 870c and then 700c, by calculating the level of the stockpile, the rate of acquisition and the funding of it, there was inevitably going to be an equation which led to an impossible situation, unless one was prepared at the same time to look at ways by which one could get wool back out of the stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Roughly, there are four markets for wool: the European market, the Japanese market, the Soviet Union and eastern European market, and the Chinese market. For about three years the Soviet Union and China were buying approximately 25 per cent of the clip. One of the tragedies over the last two years has been the extent to which those two countries-I am including eastern Europe with the Soviet Union-have largely withdrawn from the market. The product of that has been that the wools that those countries significantly bought, which were in the 22- to 24-micron range, have been the wools that have been going to a greater degree than others into the stockpile, and I am concerned greatly at the effect that the decisions of the Government through this legislation will have on the producers of those wools. </PARA>
<PARA> An average price per bale of $800 has been received in the last few years. Leaving out the two or three bale lots that come from the average backyard farmer or those who might have a relatively small flock, the average clip is somewhere between 30 and 70 bales. Take a 50-bale clip. For a big percentage of farmers, not just wool growers but farmers through a large stretch of Australia, the income from those 50 bales is critical to their income. Those 50 bales at $800 cost somewhere between $300 to $350 per bale per year to produce. As a result of the downturn in markets and the failure to promote and sell wool, farmers are now going to get about $400 a bale. Their margin, as I assess it, will be about $50 a bale, and $50 multiplied by 50 bales gives a very, very small margin indeed on which to survive, and that is without regard to the figures of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the arithmetic that it presented at the recent National Agricultural and Resource Outlook Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look firstly at that arithmetic because there has been a significant drop in wool incomes, and that drop is paralleled by the same drop as is occurring in wheat. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who sits beside me, said to me earlier today that he was concerned that in our concentration on wool we must not forget that other rural industries are also suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to wheat, there too is an enormous problem. Of course, export enhancement, common agricultural policy and a range of other international marketing additions are affecting wheat. But neither in wool nor in wheat should we place the blame alone on those export markets. In wheat as in wool it is the Government and the actions by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that have exacerbated the present position. </PARA>
<PARA> In wheat we are now in a position where, instead of having in our domestic marketing arrangements an underwriting scheme and a 90 per cent-plus first advance, they have gone. All this is happening with wheat at a time when the United States is enhancing its export enhancement program and at a time when we have seen the lack of preparedness of the Europeans to adjust their agricultural subsidies in the failure of the negotiations within the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> So a large percentage of rural Australia-and I left out the horticultural industries, which are also suffering-is going to have a significant drop in rural incomes this year. That is going to affect land values, and as land values fall-and 40 per cent of bank advances around Australia under the general credit worthiness of banks are predicated on rural mortgages-there is going to be an inevitable adverse consequence on the securities those banks hold and that will prejudice much of the financial system of Australia. Therefore, we have a drop in income, a drop in land values and an effect on the financial system. From there we start looking back at what is going to happen to employment, small business, service industries, farm machinery distributors and all those other people in the rural community. In days gone by Australian manufacturers would have provided the tractors and built the farm machinery; but that of course is no longer so. So the Government might say, `Imports will fall'. What is happening is that that chain is now significantly changed because of this Bill and because of what is happening in the rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to know that it is not price alone that is the necessary catalyst for selling wool-price is only one of the measures. There are many other aspects: the quality and reliability of delivery, and all of those other things that have never been better because of the stockpile. We now have a range of wools, which in the marketing sense we have never had before. None of those things has been used to the advantage of the wool grower or the wool industry by this Minister or the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) over the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that we need to address, therefore, the whole dimension of the implications of what is happening. We also need to register that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been responsible for the high interest rate policy and, if price is the factor, the present value of the Australian dollar is at least as much a cause of the failure to sell wool as is the minimum reserve price. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the barometer of where that dollar has moved, we see that even since the Gulf war began the dollar has firmed. The dollar is at about 78c, somewhere about 13c above where it should be if it were to be based entirely on our export revenue. The dollar is held high because of the level of interest rates and the inflow of capital which influences so much of the pattern of financial trading in our currency but does not actually affect the real substance of our economy. The difficulty in Australia is that we have this adverse chronic balance of payments problem and we have a currency that is far too high. So do not let us talk only about the MRP; let us look at other factors. I have been fascinated that there has been no reference to that by the Treasurer-no reference to the fact that if the dollar were to come down then perhaps the MRP would have been able to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> My worry in this legislation, however, really goes back to the changes introduced in 1987. As the Minister who introduced the Australian Wool Corporation in legislation that I brought to this House in 1972-which was assented to on 31 October-I had in that legislation two clauses which the Minister removed in 1987. I am not going to read those clauses; I will refer to them and tell the House what they did. Importantly, the Government and the Minister are the cause of the failure of the minimum reserve price scheme to work. The scheme that I introduced was not one that set a market price. It was a scheme that was designed as a potholing scheme. It was a scheme designed to take the bottom out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there was a great deal of controversy at the time it was introduced, and I know the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) referred to it tonight. I have no doubt that there were many at the time the scheme was introduced who felt that it was going to deprive the market forces of the opportunity to function as they should. It is fascinating that for so long it proved so successful, until the Minister changed the requirement of consultation with Treasury, removed ministerial control over the setting of the floor price and removed the requirement that the comparability of the wool price with that of other fibres be taken as a criterion in determining the market floor. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to all honourable members-and indeed to all those wool growers out there who are listening in tonight and who are concerned about this implication-that if they believe that a minimum reserve price scheme today has no merit, they should look at clauses 39 and 41 of the 1972 Bill because both of them provided controls which the Minister removed. I do not believe that second guessing the Australian Wool Corporation with the Wool Council worked. The nature of the involvement of the Wool Council has meant that the Corporation has not been able to get out and do its job as it must or as it should, and it has been compounded by market circumstances, which we all acknowledge are a part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we go and what do we do? All I want to do is get back to finding how we sell our wool to those countries who today are not buying it. If that 25 per cent of the market that takes the 22-to 24-micron wools could again be encouraged, it would enormously help the sales of wool through the stockpile. There is no perfect scheme. I wrote to all members of the Wool Council before their Launceston meeting and I set down a range of proposals. I do not pretend they are perfect, but some things still gall me. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members know that there is still better than a 60 per cent tariff imposed on processed woollen goods imported into Australia? Where is the Minister's comment on that? We have Australian manufacturers who want protection, and I would give them a bounty. But above all, why the devil do we not help those wonderful Australian designers who want to buy superfine wool? Why do we not allow those who want to buy woollen goods made up in Australia to import the fabric if they wish? We do not because we apply this ridiculous tariff and all this rubbish about the Government doing all it can. It is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other things. I have suggested export market development grants. I have talked about export finance insurance cover up to 100 per cent for notional interest which would enable wool to be sold into some of those eastern European countries and into China and the Soviet Union. I have talked about credit not only to the Soviet Union but also on a wider front. I have talked about ways by which the Government might even allow wool to go to manufacturers in those countries on credit terms, allow it to be sold in the processed form and then allow payment to be made at the end of that process. </PARA>
<PARA> If those ideas are not the right ones, Tom Hughes, in that excellent article he wrote for the Bulletin a week or two ago, referred to another two. There are plenty of ways by which we can stimulate sales, but of course that is not the only problem. We have to understand that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, out there with his hand on his chest, went around telling the wool trade of the world that the 700c was going to stick. I was delighted when he said it. But it is no use a Minister making such a guarantee-and indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) echoed it in answer to a question from the honourable member for Gwydir-and then forsaking it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter here from a wool buyer which says that our customers in Europe, Japan and worldwide are distressed. The Government's word has been broken. Now contracts to exporters are not being honoured; losses are going to be enormous to customers and exports. But the shame is on Australia and being an Australian where our word is worth nothing-and that is due to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to understand that there have already been a range of requests from various wool importers for damages-and I say all of this with no prejudice to any legal action that might be taken. A range of importers and people in the wool trade are going to lose money because of the Minister's guarantee. The Japanese, the Europeans and the British have all been put in this position, and the Minister has not even said to them, `Look, I'm sorry; I couldn't sustain the MRP'. I am concerned that the Minister should say to them, `We had no option; we have had to terminate the MRP' and, further, `What I'm concerned about is that you come back and start buying wool again'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a range of things that the Minister can do. I do not think that the former buyers deserve compensation, but I think they deserve stimulation. I want them to come in and buy and, unless we get those 22- to 24-micron wools bought, we are going to have a whole lot of growers who are not going to be able to sell half of their clip. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal that I want to say but I do not have the time to say it. As far as this particular legislation is concerned, I am very concerned that there is nothing in it to stimulate sales of wool; nothing in it to placate in any way those buyers of wool. I believe that the MRP has been mishandled by the Minister, in particular, but sadly, to a lesser degree, by the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I think now, sadly, the time has come for us to change the membership of the Wool Corporation. I would like to see a marketing director and I would like to see more commercial members of that Corporation able to promote and sell our wool; but, above all, let us recognise that the role of the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) must be preserved. We have to maintain our research and development allocations and we have to capitalise on the market opportunities that are there. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few months ago, I saw a new fur produced from wool, and that fur was being launched on the European market in the same week as the sheep reduction scheme was announced-and of course the media over there had this whole series of campaigns showing the bleeding woolmark, which was a total negative for wool. So a great deal can be done and is being done. We have to maintain the IWS and its effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not happy about the wool industry supplementary payments scheme. I think it is plagued with difficulties. It is quite impossible with that $300m the Government is providing to satisfy the shortfall for those whom, it has been suggested, probably will not even be able to sell their clips in the short term. There is a real problem in my view in the nature of the handling of the stockpile. I have not mentioned it, but I think what we have to do is have a sunset clause, and phase out the stockpile. We ought to make sure that we do not release the stockpile in such a way as to bear down on the market. We have to make sure that the stockpile is isolated in the short term. I think we ought to find a way by which then it can be progressively reduced to the point where it will go altogether because while it is there it is going to bear down on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation is a difficult piece of legislation. It is not one which I think has been well drafted, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has identified. It is one which in panic has been brought in by the Minister. It is obviously not his preferred piece of legislation, but it is the Government's legislation. My concern is for the Australians I represent who I think as a result of the failure of this minimum reserve price scheme are going to be a lot worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous financial crisis now impending in rural Australia, and I do not believe this legislation, the Government's response to wool growers, to wool buyers or, for that matter, to those in the wheat industry or the horticultural industry, is good enough. It saddens me that, until the next Federal election, I cannot see that it is going to be corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share many of the concerns that have just been expressed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I think that the wool marketing support scheme as it was originally conceived and implemented in the early 1970s was a very good scheme that brought stability to the wool industry out of the chaos that had been a feature of the industry prior to that time. Unfortunately, the scheme that had been in operation for some considerable time has been brought into disrepute and has now been made unworkable, and in my view that has been caused by bad management and greed on the part of the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that much of the bad management of the industry has been caused by the Australian Wool Corporation, and I would in no way try to excuse the actions of the Wool Corporation itself. I think that in many ways not only have its actions been highlighted by bad management decisions and a lack of policy planning, but also it has been gravely incompetent in the way that it has misled the wool industry and the wool growers throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that part of the proposal now before the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is to replace the present Wool Corporation with an administrator and, to be frank with honourable members, I could think of nothing better because I have absolutely no faith whatever in the present Wool Corporation or the membership of that Corporation, and I would advocate to the Government that it should be sacked in total and replaced by some other body. If the only alternative is an administrator, then it should be an administrator that replaces the present Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that added to the incompetent management of the wool industry by the Wool Corporation has been the greed that has been expressed by the wool growers through the Wool Council of Australia. They have claimed a price for their product that has been unrealistic in the marketplace. They have claimed that price, it would seem to me, as a result of pressure by their bank managers based on the debts that they themselves have accumulated, but it bears no relationship whatever to the value of their product in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind all wool growers and all honourable members of this House that any product, be it wool or anything else, is only worth what somebody else will pay for it. What the wool industry through the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation has done is to deceive itself that its product is worth more than the marketplace will pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need at the moment more than anything else is a selling scheme that will allow wool to be sold to the trade for a price that the trade will pay for it so as to allow wool to flow through the scheme from producer to end user on a free and open basis. That cannot happen while we have an interventionist scheme that decides that that product is worth more than the user will pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that intervention, as a result of bad management by the Corporation, as a result of greed on the part of the Corporation as expressed through the Wool Council, Australia has now accumulated a stockpile of close to five million bales of wool, with an accumulated debt in the wool industry of about $3 billion. My view is that that stockpile of wool will be a blot on our copybook and will distort the wool market for at least the next 10 years, because ultimately that five million bales stockpile of wool- albeit that it may be frozen on a short term basis-must ultimately be fed into the marketplace, and while it is being fed into the marketplace it will distort the future sales of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to that, we have a situation where the wool industry, through the Wool Corporation, now has an accumulated debt close to $3 billion. That debt, most of which has been borrowed from overseas sources, is guaranteed by the Australian taxpayer. My view is that if the wool industry is allowed to sell its product to the market for whatever the market will pay, there will not be sufficient income generated through the wool industry to allow that debt to be repaid and at the same time allow wool producers to remain solvent. So ultimately the Government will be faced with the situation where either it forces a considerable number of wool growers to the wall and they become bankrupt because of the high taxes and levies that are imposed on their product or it passes on the debts that are accumulated by the Wool Corporation to the general body of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Although that decision may be delayed for some time, my view is that ultimately the Government will be forced into the situation where the debts of the Wool Corporation will be passed on to the general body of taxpayers. It is on that basis that nobody in Australia can claim to be distanced from the problems that are currently being experienced in the wool industry. All Australian taxpayers will be required to pay the debts that have now been accumulated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the long term, the ultimate objective of whatever scheme the Government or the wool industry develops should be that wool can be produced in Australia and allowed to flow through to the market and the end producers without any constraint. On that basis, I believe that the present market stabilisation scheme is probably dead because there is no way that the industry or any other person can intervene and claim that a product has a value higher than the marketplace can pay for it. The present scheme probably met its doom in 1987 when the wool industry, through the Corporation, decided that wool had a value of 870c a kilogram, albeit that a number of major buyers, in particular China and Russia, withdrew from the marketplace at that time, and that its product was worth more than the marketplace was prepared to pay for it. I think that was sad and we are now coming to the realisation that wool or any other product must be allowed to flow through to the market on a normal and orderly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present circumstances, I think it is necessary for the stockpile of 4.8 million bales to be frozen because we will not get orderly marketing of the present clip of wool until that stockpile is frozen, although that stockpile must be allowed to flow through over an extended period of time which ultimately will distort the marketplace. Flowing on from that, the debts of the Corporation will not be able to be covered by wool growers. The tax levy will not be sufficient to cover the debts that have now been accumulated. It will be necessary for that to be passed on to the general body of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> One solution that has been suggested in general discussion in Australia is that a flock reduction program ought to be put in place. There is no question that that will happen. Regardless of whatever scheme might be introduced by the Government, there is no question that the lack of returns will force a stock reduction program. The sad feature of the whole program is that I have heard many economists suggest that supply should be brought into line with demand. Plainly, if we gear up the wool industry to accommodate an increase in demand, supply of the product cannot be turned off. I am afraid that many city-based economists do not understand the simple fact of wool growing life that the sheep are still out grazing and at the end of the season must be shorn and that that shorn product will add to the stock of product. It is not good enough to say that we ought have a stock reduction program and think that 20 or 30 million sheep can suddenly be shot and removed from the scene. They cannot be removed; they will still be there producing wool and will still need to be shorn at the end of the season. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever problems we have now with the wool industry will not be solved by this interim measure that the Government is now moving to bring in. It may help in the short term, but it will not solve the problems of the industry. While the Government may bring in these interim measures, I strongly suggest that it wait to determine its final position until the Vines committee of inquiry has had an opportunity to report. The Government should determine what its future strategy might be based on the recommendations of the Vines committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I have personally totally lost confidence in the competence of the Australian Wool Corporation, and I strongly suggest to the Minister that the Wool Corporation be scrapped and replaced by an administrator. I have totally lost confidence in the recommendations that might come from the Australian Wool Council, because I believe the Wool Council has been motivated only by greed, and I do not believe that those are sufficient to be able to influence government policy. I strongly suggest to the Minister that the decision he makes be based on bringing long term stability to the wool industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last 12 months have been extremely stressful for wool growers. It is most regrettable that they have been starved of information about what has been going on in their industry. Major decisions have been made either by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) or by the Australian Wool Corporation. These decisions have been dropped on wool growers with little warning or explanation and, understandably, that has left them in a state of confusion and despair. A few days ago the Corporation suspended sales because it had simply run out of money and the Government would not guarantee it any more. That point ought to be made clear: the Corporation suspended the sales and the Minister, following upon that, suspended the reserve price scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are left with a situation today where growers now have difficulty believing anything that the Minister says after his statement that the 700c floor price is immutable. Growers also have difficulty believing anything that the Corporation says, particularly after its string of projections in its business plans that it has been putting to us over the last 12 months or so. The latest projection had a certain number of heroic assumptions in it-for example, that the Russians would come in as significant buyers before the end of the selling season and the 700c floor could be held with a 35 per cent tax and a 70 per cent quota. That would have returned growers something less than 320c a kilogram. Our calculations said that we probably would have needed at least a 40 per cent tax and a 60 per cent quota, which would have meant wool grower incomes after 1 July-if this were implemented-falling to 252c. So we would have had growers selling their wool to buyers at 700c and getting 252c in their pockets, which is a totally ridiculous and unsustainable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, we have debt today at $2.9 billion and a market share for wool at an all time low. I find this loss of market share particularly distressing. After all, a cardinal rule of business has been violated. It appears that the wool reserve price scheme has gone the same way as all other primary industry floor schemes where supply could not be controlled in response to the higher than marketplace prices that were sought. We have seen this with coffee, cocoa, oil, tin, rubber and so on. Most of these schemes collapsed after about 15 to 20 years because those administering them lost sight of the original goal. I guess that when a scheme is running fairly well it is human nature to start using the floor price as a price setting scheme rather than a price smoothing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the 20,000-odd commodities that are traded in the world show that at some stage in their life they have had a wide variation of price. Therefore, floor price schemes, given enough time-if they are inflexible-are going to be sorely tested. The wool reserve price scheme, if it had stayed on its long term trend line of about 580c, possibly could have held. I think that is a strong possibility. But the Minister handed over power to the Corporation a couple of years ago-and to his credit he admits it was a mistake-and we saw the price rise dramatically over a two-year period from 508c to 870c, a rise of some 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That 870c was put in place when the market price for wool was in free fall. It was not much over 1,000c at the time. So it was set in place at about 85 per cent of the market price-a price that was in free fall. It was done against a reversing exchange rate. It was done when China, Russia and eastern Europe were pulling out of the market. It was done when United States reaction to higher prices was starting to trickle through. It was done when there were some signs of a world downturn in the textile market overall. It was done when a massive oversupply was obviously developing. </PARA>
<PARA> All the ingredients were present for a market price that was headed not only downward, but considerably below the long term trend line. The elementary rules of charting would tell anyone that, and to this day I am at a loss to know how this was overlooked by the Corporation. There were, of course, people on the Corporation and on the Australian Council of Wool Exporters who were pressing for 1,000c a kilogram, but even at 870c it was defying gravity, it was doomed to failure, and the result was a rapidly increasing stockpile with massive amounts of borrowings to fund it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when the floor was dropped by the Minister to 700c, it did improve the wool-synthetic-cotton ratio and, given enough time, that probably would have helped. Regrettably, it had only six months. It takes about 18 months for these things to flow through, as people would understand. Probably the last chance for it to work was in early January of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of us were alarmed to hear an accusation made the other day by Don Booth, the President of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters, that when the buying by the Corporation had dropped into the high 20 per cent range the Wool Corporation, instead of dropping 7,000 to 10,000 bales on to the weekly market as it had been doing for the previous week, put 56,500 bales on to the market. In his opinion that blew the trade buying out. The following week I think it was 44, then 47 1/2 and then 60 per cent-if the figures he gave are correct. I think that is worth investigation. So today we have $2.8 billion of debt, there is to be no more lending without government guarantee, sales are suspended and the floor price is suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> One good thing that has come out of it, I suppose, is that quotas have been abolished. That is great news. I, like every other member with a wool growing electorate, have had numerous complaints about the inequities of quotas. Never in history have they worked. They are full of inequities. They have had no coalition support whatsoever. I for one have been surprised that the Wool Corporation went ahead spending growers' money, knowing that quotas could never see the light of day because we would not support them. Why the Corporation did that is quite beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the suspension some industry leaders are saying that the abolition or suspension of the reserve price scheme is going to throw growers into poverty, into chaos, and we will move back into the old days of boom and bust, poor prices and so on. I ask how this could be. I was alive when we did not have that scheme and, apart from the early 1970s, things did not seem to be going too badly. Logic tells me that there is something wrong with this statement when the same growers who are saying this send their beef, their lambs, their pigs and so on out to auction without a floor price and seem to get by. Also, the great wool properties of Australia and the great wool industry of this country were established over the last 150 years before this scheme came in. </PARA>
<PARA> I took out some figures comparing the 17 years that the scheme has been running with the 17 years previous to the scheme. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. If one looks at the table, the figures are quite revealing. The number of bales sold each year in the 17 years previous to the scheme is much more stable than for the 17 years that the scheme has been operating. The average number of bales that were sold in the 17 years previous to the scheme was 4.21 million a year, and for the 17 years this scheme has been operating the figure is also 4.21 million bales a year. So we have not sold any more wool as a result. If we convert the prices-and I have converted them to 1988-89 dollars-certainly in real terms there was more variation in the 17 years previous to the scheme, but the growers were getting a 46 per cent higher income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise there are other things such as productivity, relative prices of other commodities, et cetera, to be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, growers were getting about 50 per cent more money in their hands than they were in the years that the scheme was operating. So I find it difficult to understand how things were so much worse before the scheme came into place. It has not been demonstrated to me factually yet. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in the first 15 years that the scheme ran it went pretty well. It did what it was supposed to do. It cost the growers about $100m a year to run it and made many of them feel much more secure. That was an average of about $1,500 to $2,000 for each of the 60,000-odd growers in this country. But today we find that the average grower owes the Corporation $48,000. This is, of course, offset by the marketplace value of the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times the AWC wanted to borrow another $1,000m, which would have blown out that grower debt to the AWC to $65,000 each on average. By a number of projections, had this been done the stockpile would have continued to grow to about 8.6m bales, with a debt of over $4,000m, a selling price of 700c and the grower getting 252c in the pocket. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time remaining I would like briefly to cover a few other things that we need to do to get wool moving. First and foremost, I think the wool price mechanism needs flexibility. It has not had flexibility since the scheme has been in place. Cotton and synthetics, for most of their life, have been able to move up and down in tune with consumer needs and demand-in other words, the marketplace. Wool, unfortunately, has not been able to do that. When there is a downturn compared with other fibres, wool is put at a distinct disadvantage. In other words, it tends to be shut out of the marketplace during downturns. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern I have is that I believe the operations of the International Wool Secretariat can be improved. Australia last year kicked in about $190m of the $260m budget-something in excess of 72 per cent. I believe this organisation needs revamping. It needs competition to get it moving. When I was in Hong Kong with the National Party China wool delegation we had a briefing by staff there, including top staff. Quite frankly I was not impressed with what they told us and the way in which they answered our questions. To be honest, I would not have fed half of them. I think a bit of competition injected into them would have done them the world of good. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of colours and designs of affordable woollen fabric is very limited today. If honourable members doubt that, they should ask any woman. There has been very little imagination with design and colour. Synthetics and cotton seem to be almost unlimited in that area. I think it is very regrettable that wool, a product very dear to my heart, is missing out. We seem to be losing out on so many things. Hospitals used to have woollen blankets but now they are all cotton blankets. Official sports gear in this country-tracksuits, et cetera-used to be made from wool; now they are cotton. A lot of mountaineering and camping gear used to be made from wool; now it is synthetic, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We all recognise wool's good points; it is soft, it breathes well, it is warm, it is hydroscopic and it has low flammability. We can be very proud of what we have developed in this country. We are improving on these qualities. It is time we recognised wool's bad points so that we can work on them. We have to recognise that it shrinks, it creases, it has a high cost, not only to buy but also to maintain. For example, we have to dry-clean instead of wash products, vis-a-vis synthetics. There are too few designs and colours, boring ones at that, which I have just mentioned. It is prickly close to the skin. It is hot, it stains readily, it has poor wearability-my wife can attest to that because she is always darning my woollen socks-and it is time that we concentrated more on some of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the IWS has had too much concentration on the top end of the market. It has followed the west European cocktail circuit which it had to do, but it has neglected the middle range wools. A classic example of that was the Bicentennial fashion parade where these useless garments were paraded. It was a great night for the people who were there but there is not a woman in my electorate who would want to buy and wear one of those garments. There is a recognition that blends have been neglected. For example, if we blend wool we can get durability back into the wool and we have the best of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the stockpile. We have a massive 4.8 million bales in stock-more than we usually sell in one year. It costs the grower, depending on what the interest rate is at the time, $5,000 to $10,000 a year to maintain that stockpile. Therefore, it is desirable to get rid of it as soon as possible. However, not wanting to flood the market, it is a fine balancing act. Even if we release it at, say, 2 per cent a month, it will take 4 1/2 years to get rid of it. Two per cent is 100,000 bales a month, which has a depressing effect on the market. We do have that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The reserve price scheme has been a buffer stock scheme which I think has become outdated. It is inherently inefficient as a mechanism for spreading risk for growers. Much better would be a buffer fund scheme where one buys stocks in when prices would have dropped below the floor and one sells them when they rise above the floor. One has costs of physical storage and consumer delay in getting access. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a little graph demonstrating that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The buffer fund scheme overcomes all those difficulties. It is much more logical and less costly. Time is short, so I must finish. If the Government is fair dinkum, income equalisation deposits should be brought back and put in place so that each grower can do this type of thing to suit his own situation. Growers must become educated in future so that they can sell ahead to lock in prices and stabilise income if they want to. Therefore, we have a whole host of more efficient, less costly, more effective and more personalised options available to replace the comparative clumsy, costly and now somewhat outdated buffer stock scheme. It is tragic what has happened to the wool industry in this country over the last two or three years-tragic because growers ultimately will have to pay for that. Regrettably, it will take five years or more to work through these mistakes to get them out of the system. However, with the correct policies put in place we can restore again, I believe, wool to its rightful place as our premier export income earner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining this debate I would like to declare an interest as I am a wool grower. I would like to begin by talking briefly about the importance of the industry and then confine my remarks to two major areas because I think most of the other points I would like to raise have already been covered by my colleagues more than adequately. Those two areas I would like to talk about relate to some of the recent history of the reserve price scheme and, in particular, the role of the Government and the role of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and also some of the current proposals that have been put forward to try to get us out of the problem and some of the shortcomings. I then wish to highlight some of the very good points of the amendments that have been moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As many honourable members have already pointed out, the wool industry has been the backbone of rural Australia virtually since European settlement. For well over 150 years it has been the most successful industry, it has been the largest industry and it most certainly has built this nation to what it is today. The fact that it has survived for well over 150 years shows not only its resilience but the innovation that has been available. The people who have been involved in wool growing for so many years have led the way for so long and have made a contribution to the growth of this nation second to none. I think that is something that the industry can be proud of. It is something that all honourable members should remind themselves of when so often we now talk about other industries and tend to overlook the massive contribution that is made by the rural industries and, in particular, the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look back just over two years ago we find that the wool industry contributed nearly $6,000m to the export earnings of Australia. It was Australia's No. 1 export earning industry. More importantly-I think this is a point that honourable members should be reminded of from time to time-the wool industry, like most of our rural industries, is almost 100 per cent wholly Australian owned. That is a very important point. When we see the figures related to our export earnings, we see it being done by Australians. We are not talking about big land holders. By and large-as has been said many times-the average wool grower is not a big land holder and is not a big operator. There are in excess of 60,000 individual farmers who are contributing to making this industry so great. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as has been well documented already, we are now in a crisis that probably could have been avoided, certainly it could have been very much lessened in its impact, had the Government not made some dreadful mistakes, mistakes that may have been compounded by others, but mistakes that ultimately must be seen as the responsibility of the Government, and particularly the Minister at the table. I pay tribute to the fact that the Minister has sat through this debate. I think it is something that some of his colleagues ought to learn from because too rare is the time when a Minister sits through a debate on a piece of legislation that he has introduced into this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> If we start to go back to where the reserve price scheme went wrong, we can stop at the 1987 legislation, legislation that was introduced by this Minister, legislation that the Minister believed had finally got the industry to the position where he wanted it so that he could hand over the running of the industry to industry leaders. No doubt the Minister did this in good faith but the fact is that it has all gone horribly wrong and the ultimate responsibility has to lie with the Minister himself. Why did it go horribly wrong? It went horribly wrong basically because the Minister sat on his hands when he knew he should have been acting and when he knew he had the opportunity to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note an article that the Minister wrote for the Stock &amp;Land last week. When speaking about the fact that the reserve price scheme had been raised up to 870c, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The only events that could have been foreseen were that the Reserve Price Scheme would be put under stress with a floating exchange rate, that a minimum reserve of 870c/kg would induce extra production, and the negative reaction of customers to the very high prices of 1987 and 1988. These factors were foreseen but ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that last point-`foreseen but ignored'. I would say to the Minister that he must have been the one who ignored them, because he is now trying to wash his hands of the fact that he allowed this disaster to develop and did nothing about it until the eleventh hour. To say that there were not warnings out, as some have tried to pretend, ignores the fact that there were some very clear warnings around. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time I have available, I just draw attention to one warning. That appeared in an article in the Weekend Australian at the end of May 1988. That article, written by Julian Cribb and entitled `The price that could floor the wool industry' set out with chilling foresight just what was going to happen if the wool industry adopted an 870c floor price. That, of course, was written prior to that fateful decision. As was said in the introduction:</PARA>
<PARA>The wool industry is poised to take a decision that could have a devastating impact on its future and on the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that last point. The article went on to set out, chapter and verse, just what could happen. The Minister cannot deny that things were ignored, because he was one of the ones who ignored these warnings. He sat on his hands when the industry, under his new legislation in 1987, set in train some of the events that have led to the current crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Minister has more to answer for than that. He is part of a government that has pursued macro-economic policies that have made very much more difficult the problems confronting the wool industry, wool growers, small business and people right throughout Australia-particularly those who are trying to get on in the export game. I am talking about the fact that for the last three years he has been party to the Government's deliberately running a high interest rate policy, a policy that has not only put up the costs of many people but also has led to a higher value of the Australian dollar than would otherwise have been the case. Again, that exacerbated the problems that the wool industry faced, because clearly it made our exports more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the Minister up on another point-one that some of his colleagues have been keen to back up, including the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), when they talk about lack of information. We heard the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) talk about this too. The answer to that question should be: where was the Minister? We cannot just blame the Australian Wool Corporation or the Australian Wool Council-although I am critical of both, because I do not think they have kept the growers properly informed. The Minister, with his Department, has access to all the information and to what the Corporation was thinking. Yet he sat on his hands and did not tell the industry what was really happening until it was virtually too late. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Minister's behaviour in the latest round of amendments that he brought forward. After the floor price had been suspended, he came out with a big statement; but the statement is so vague about what he will do after the next few weeks that again it really does not give any direction to the industry. It is another case of saying, `I would like to help, but I am not too sure what I am doing'. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 November, after having looked at the Corporation's plans, the Minister announced that he would agree to quotas. He said that he may not be impressed with them, but would go along with them if it was necessary. But, in his interview last Tuesday, when he announced his latest plans, he said, when asked about the question of quotas:</PARA>
<PARA>They would have been murderously difficult to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA>He must have known that back in November, yet he was prepared to go along with that plan and tell the industry that he was prepared to legislate for that. I think he has a lot to answer for on that, because we are looking at a pattern of indecision, a pattern of sitting on his hands and a pattern of coming in with too little too late. Of course, as has as been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the same thing has happened with income equalisation deposits-they have been brought in too late. In the press conference last Tuesday the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Cabinet will have to meet again to take decisions on the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>How long does he need? He has the Department there. The Department has been giving him advice, no doubt for months, that he might have to be preparing some alternative plans. The Minister must have known about it; yet he says Cabinet will have to meet again. </PARA>
<PARA> What would those decisions involve? They would involve just about everything. In the longer term, we have to look at what we are going to do with promotion, research and development, and management of the stockpile. They are pretty critical decisions. The decisions also include what we are going to do with management of the debt and what is going to happen with the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation board. To top it all off, the Minister could not even make a decision whether to suspend the floor price indefinitely or allow it to be sneaking back on 1 July. He could not even give us an answer on that.</PARA>
<PARA> How will the buyers react with all that indecision? The buyers are already in a rage with Australia; they are already utterly disgusted with the behaviour of the Minister, who goes around the world giving an immutable, ironclad guarantee of 700c for the next 18 months. What happens? It is not the same as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) saying, `I cannot tell you that I am going to drop the exchange rate', because the Treasurer does not deliberately travel around the world making that statement and promoting it. This Minister went around the world and promoted it, but he knew in his own heart that it probably could not work. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we seeing? Indecision after indecision. Time is running out, but I could go on to talk about some of the other things that the Minister has done to the wool industry and of which he is not very proud-things such as the commitment he gave before the 1987 election about promotion. As soon as the election was over, he saw fit to break that commitment-not once, but twice. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray has outlined in some detail how the Opposition is determined to give a much clearer view about where we should be going with this industry so that growers and the buying trade know what the future of marketing is going to be. There is no doubt we are going to face some very difficult times and there is no doubt that many growers will suffer enormously-and not only the growers, but their families and, even sadder, in many cases their children. Today I heard a tragic story about a young boy in my electorate. These are the sorts of things that are coming out of this crisis. I cannot help thinking that, had the Minister not made such a terrible blunder in 1987, we may not have seen the terrible hurt that will now be seen in much of rural Australia. It is not just the wool growers-and, of course, the wheat growers, who are suffering similar problems for other reasons-but those who live in the country towns, those who service them and those who are working to try to make this country greater. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, while the Minister may have operated in good faith, he has made a very grave mistake. He may have admitted it and may even feel lousy about it, but he is responsible. He may have meant well, he may have wanted the industry to run itself and he may have even put faith in its leaders, but under his own legislation he is responsible. In short, he and his Government have failed. There used to be a thing called the Westminster tradition. I do not know whether the Minister's Government believes in it nowadays, but it is something that I would have thought he would consider very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as my colleague the honourable member for Barker said last week:</PARA>
<PARA>One can hear Government members pouring out blame on everybody else but themselves. The Government can blame all of us, and everybody who did not stand up and voice his disapproval when the Government loosened this scheme three years ago, when it took away the checks and balances. But blame is cheap and responsibility is deep, and responsibility overrides all in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA>We all bear the blame. But the Minister and his Government bear the responsibility, and for that they will never be forgiven. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am deeply disappointed by the action of the Government and others that has brought our great wool industry to its present parlous situation. I speak as one of the many who supported the retention of a floor price. I supported its retention right up till the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) announced that he would go back on his word and scrap the floor price. For the past 18 years-in fact, since 1973-the floor price has provided stability for the wool industry, and in particular has enabled growers to plan and budget for future seasons. Wool growers now face dramatically reduced incomes and a huge interest bill. On top of this, the Government is trying to saddle them with an open-ended supplementary payment scheme which could cost up to $1 billion in additional debt to the Australian Wool Corporation and therefore ultimately to the wool growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Already through the Australian Wool Corporation's borrowings Australia's 60,000 wool growers are in debt to the tune of approximately $42,000 each. An additional $1 billion debt will result in that indebtedness blowing out to $58,000 per wool grower-a figure I believe most wool growers would find untenable. For this reason, the National and Liberal parties have moved an amendment to limit wool growers' debt by ensuring that a blow-out in Corporation borrowings will not occur. The National and Liberal parties would like to see the additional Corporation's borrowings for the supplementary payment scheme limited to $200m and not permitted to blow-out to the suggested $700m proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it is interesting to do some calculations which would be of significance to wool growers. If the floor price had been retained at 700c a kilogram clean and the proposed 35 per cent wool tax and a 70 per cent quota introduced for the 1991-92 selling season, a wool grower's cash flow would equate to approximately 319c a kilogram clean. If the wool tax was 40 per cent and the quota 60 per cent-figures suggested as being more realistic to fund the stockpile-a wool grower's cash flow would equate to approximately 250c a kilogram clean. This effectively means that, if 21-micron wool sells for any more than approximately 300c clean, wool growers will be better off in terms of their cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA> But, if the original legislation introduced by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was then the Minister for Primary Industry, had been left in place and not amended in 1987, the wool industry would in all probability not face the problems it does today. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool is one of the few commodities in the world for which Australia can control or strongly influence the international market. The success of the scheme is reflected in the fact that during the scheme's 18-year history the Federal Government has never been called upon to honour any loans it has guaranteed for the maintenance of the floor price scheme. Yet in many areas, including the car and steel industries to name a couple, the cost to taxpayers has been millions of dollars in restructuring assistance and so on. However, in the hour of need of Australia's greatest agricultural industry, the Federal Government was only able to offer some $300m, even though it is an industry that has earned billions of dollars in export income. To be fair to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I believe that he did try to have that amount increased but Cabinet was not amenable to his pleas. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office in 1983, the wool industry has earned over $29.1 billion in export income, propping up the Federal Government's balance of payments deficit. As if the economy is not in a bad enough state now, just imagine what depth of recession or perhaps depression we would be in without our great wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has gone back on his word and announced the suspension of the reserve price scheme for the rest of the 1990-91 selling season. This is a decision we must now reluctantly accept because it appears that the retention of the scheme is no longer viable. As I am sure the House can appreciate, this decision has left growers in an extreme state of uncertainty, and this is typified in the electorate of Riverina-Darling. I know that most honourable members here would be aware that the Riverina and west Darling areas produce a great amount of the wool that is exported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the House would be aware, the majority of the wool stockpile consists of middle micron wool, or wool typical of that produced by wool growers in the Riverina and western New South Wales. It is these growers-the producers of 22 to 24 micron wool-who will be severely affected by the Federal Government's decision to suspend the floor price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these producers in the Riverina and western New South Wales are in many ways worse off than others as they are geared up specifically for wool production and cannot easily move into the production of another commodity. They were not speculators. They did not move into wool to cash in on the boom. Many properties growing wool have been owned by the same family for two or more generations, and wool is their livelihood-not cattle, grains or any other agricultural commodity; just wool. Wool is all they produce, and that is why the decision being taken by this Parliament to suspend the floor price, even admitting that this result was inevitable, could have a devastating effect on many growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Many have borrowed money after lengthy consultation with their banks, and then they have run into high interest rates. They have done their figures based on the retention of the floor price, erred on the side of caution, and now find that due to the scrapping of the floor price they do not know where to turn. They do not know whether they will be able to meet their next interest repayments and, if they cannot, what action their bank will take. Will the bank increase its interest rates, placing them further in debt; will the bank defer their repayment; or will the bank sell their property? All these questions are going through their minds, and we cannot blame them for being extremely anxious about their future and that of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the financial distress that will be suffered by wool growers and their families, those small businesses in country centres that rely on wool growers for their income will also be seriously affected. Already country businesses are noticing the effect of the rural crisis, and there will not be one village, town or city in my electorate that will not be adversely affected by the debacle in which the wool industry now finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA> When farmers are not spending, no-one is spending. That is the influence our rural communities have on our total economy. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stated recently that the unemployment level today is the result of high interest rates 18 months ago. Imagine the effect this downturn is going to have on major metropolitan areas in the next 18 months to two years. I just ask the banks to be considerate and to show some compassion to those farmers and small business people who approach them because they are experiencing difficulties in meeting their debt repayments as a result of the wool crisis and the rural crisis in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be aware that the rural wealth producing system is presently in dire circumstances, and this has been highlighted by the visit this week to Canberra by the National Farmers Federation. We in the National Party have been bringing this message to Canberra for several years, but it is only now when the rural sector is actually in deep crisis with some farmers' positions being irretrievable that the Government appears to be taking some notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the farming sector has been under siege from the present Federal Government through rises in taxes and charges. One of the latest examples was the increase on 1 January of meat inspection charges to recoup 100 per cent of the cost of meat inspectors, which has added tremendously to costs in the rural sector, despite pre-election promises by the Minister that this would not happen. While this has been going on, there have been no reforms on the waterfront, in the transport sector or in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why this Government continues to attack and destroy the very sector, along with the mining industry, that has in the past and will in the future, if it does not succumb in today's crisis, keep Australia's economy afloat. On top of all this, we now find that the wheat industry is under siege from a trade war being waged by the United States of America and the European Community. So those farmers in my electorate who are both wheat and sheep producers, as distinct from the sole sheep producers in the west, still have nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that constantly concerns me about the wool industry is that most of our wool leaves Australia in a large bale, returning in the form of high quality cloth. For a country that produces the best fine wool in the world, this situation is an absurdity. What is even more absurd is that, when our own wool re-enters Australia in the form of cloth, it attracts a 35 per cent tax. Only those wool fabrics lighter than 125 grams per square metre or more than 115 centimetres wide are exempt-in other words, blouse weight wool unsuitable for tailored trousers or suits. One of the major reasons why we are not a producer of fine woollen garments or cloth is that our cost for production is not competitive with that of our major competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> But the wool industry is only one example of where we are hogtied by our industrial relations system. Who in their right mind would invest in Australian manufacturing with our present penalty rates, holiday loading, lack of productivity and our rigid centralised industrial relations club reigning supreme? This situation is being highlighted as Australia experiences the worst recession, a recession we had to have, since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the crisis in the wool industry is going to hit hard on top of the crisis already being experienced by rural Australia. In fact an indication of this is evident within my electorate where a number of families in isolated areas will not be able to afford to send their children to school. While up to the completion of the primary school stage children can be educated through distance education even though it may be difficult, the provision of secondary education will be almost impossible for some. It is important, then, that the rural adjustment scheme be upgraded and sufficient financial assistance be made available to assist those many farmers who will find themselves in financial trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Also of great importance is the rural counselling scheme, which is already overworked in many rural areas. Rural counsellors have earned for themselves very high reputations for the quality of assistance they provide in advising and counselling those who find themselves experiencing economic difficulties and sometimes psychological trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Council has asked that these amendments to the Wool Marketing Act be opposed in the Senate, but this would be an irresponsible action because it would prevent wool sales from starting for at least another three weeks and it would place at risk the $300m offered by the Government to assist with the supplementary payments. About 2.5 million bales are still to be sold before the end of June, and this amount has to be divided by the number of weeks left. </PARA>
<PARA> Restoring confidence in the wool industry is of paramount importance, and to reject this legislation would only hinder this objective. There is no doubt that, although the Government has had months to prepare a structure for the future of the wool industry, it has failed to do so. I am afraid that, despite the fact that there is great despair and uncertainty in the rural sector, the Government has once again let rural producers down. Unfortunately, we will in the not too distant future be back in this House once again debating this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill is possibly one of the saddest debates that I have ever heard in this Parliament because it brings home to us all the very real human cost that can befall the people of Australia due to the decisions made by members of this House and, in particular, by the current Government. The Government announced on Monday, 11 February the suspension of the minimum reserve price scheme for the rest of the 1990-91 wool selling season. It is the firm view of the Opposition that it is not just a case of suspension; it is time that the Government, the industry and the Australian people, who undoubtedly will be affected by these decisions, faced the fact that the system as we have known it since 1973 is now dead. For better or for worse, we have the difficult duty ahead of us of trying to chart a new course forward for the wool industry and for those hundreds of thousands of men and women and their children across every State of this continent who for generations have served the industry and by doing so have served Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of us in this House, and I would be one of them, can trace our relationship to the wool industry as far back as 1837-a long time ago. Therefore, we speak with some feeling about the conditions facing the farmers of Australia today-facts which were brought home to us so clearly and eloquently yesterday by the National Farmers Federation which, in its recent survey-the country crisis financial survey-demonstrated that in the case of wool farmers, in particular, there has been a drop of income of 77.2 per cent between 1989-90 and the current financial year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 77.2 per cent. I wonder how many other people in Australia have had to face that sort of reduction in income while, at the same time, they have had to face a continuing upward spiral in the cost of production which-as my eloquent colleagues have said in this chamber during the debate tonight-has been caused by the incompetence and inefficiency of this Hawke Labor Government in introducing the changes to the waterfront, the changes to transportation and other changes in micro-economic policy which it has talked about ad nauseam. But in stark contrast on this occasion we are seeing before us the cost in real terms to the lives and the futures of all Australians, because our balance of trade and our balance of payments is so closely related to the survival of our rural industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For so long it was the belief of this nation that Australia was riding on the sheep's back. One thing is certain: the sheep is now on its own back and we are looking for somewhere else to lie. There is only one answer to that problem and it is simply this: we have to support the industry to the extent that we are competent to do so, because at this particular time the problems that it is currently facing have been largely due to the wrong decisions having been made in the past. It is very noticeable that in the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) the Government actually had the honesty to say what those problems were. For example, we were told that the decision to suspend the operation of the reserve price scheme was inevitable. Certainly, as we have stated, the Opposition supports that view. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It was no longer possible to permit the Australian Wool Corporation, on behalf of Australian wool growers, to go on purchasing greater and greater quantities of wool, levying higher and higher taxes, and incurring more and more debt to do so. The hope that consumer demand would recover and that the Corporation's stockpile and debt would be stabilised has not been realised. At a fixed minimum reserve price of 700c per kilogram, buyers of Australian wool have stayed out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important words perhaps are `have stayed out of the market'. If one reads the Minister's second reading speech and studies the events of the last few years, the Government's inability to make the right decisions at the right time becomes, sadly, starkly evident. One of those bad decisions, for example, was made when the minimum reserve price for wool was increased to over 800c by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) between 1986-87, and by more than 70 per cent from 508c to 870c in 1988-89. I have yet to hear an adequate explanation as to why that decision was made at that particular time. It is a sad reflection on the industry perhaps that the beneficiaries at that time-namely, the wool producers-who were of course only too happy to have a high price for their wool, were never told what the long term dangers would be of taking an approach which was in the interests of the producer but which ignored the interests of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the greatest lessons we have to learn from this unfortunate imbroglio is that at the other end of the pipeline, some 18 months down the road, the mills of Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere have to buy our commodity and produce a finished good with it at a market price which they can afford. Therefore, it is not just a case of looking to the interests of the producer, but also those of the consumer-not in the sense of the final market consumer but the person who initially buys the raw product and makes something of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the effect of the minimum reserve price did a lot to support and stabilise the industry in those early years. It was not ever designed, and should never have been used, as a mechanism for continually forcing up the price to artificial levels which ultimately could not be sustained by the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on the other side, certain events took place, in 1990 in particular and even earlier, for which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has to take responsibility. In October 1990 the Minister was aware that the floor price was no longer sustainable. He established the Vines inquiry to look into the whole implications of the wool marketing and selling arrangements. We have heard all sorts of reports about people going around Europe with their loose talk, suggesting to the manufacturers what the impact of lower prices would be. We have the famous Campbell letter which was referred to in Question Time today and which has been referred to by speakers in this House tonight. I seek the leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the letter which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) wrote to a newspaper in the town of Biella in Italy, which town has as one of its major industries the utilisation of Australian raw wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>January 19, 1991</PARA>
<PARA>Dear</PARA>
<PARA>As an ex woolgrower and the Federal Member of Parliament for the seat of Kalgoorlie, a seat that includes all the pastoral areas of Western Australia, I have an abiding interest in the wool industry. While Australia does not ride on the sheep's back to the same extent as it did up until the 1960's, wool is still an important major industry and certainly the most decentralised industry in an otherwise very urbanised society. </PARA>
<PARA>I am continually amazed at how ignorant the Australian wool growers, who produce the world's best fibre, are of the wool processing industry; and how little the European wool processors, who produce the world's best woollen material, know about the Australian Wool Industry. There is an excuse for the wool growers as they have been under the spell of the Wool Corporation who have been trying to turn the industry into a religion, where faith replaces reason, and blind loyalty is preferred to honest inquiry. There is no defence for the processors unless they too have become entranced by the corporation's mumbo jumbo. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two problems currently facing the industry, one is the present price and the other, a much more important one, is continual loss of markets. Even the blind or the drovers dog can understand that withholding Australian wool from the market when wool is easily substituted can only benefit other wool producing countries or lend to substitution by other fibres. Predictably this is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, it is surprising that the processing industry in Europe does not realise just how badly the Australian Wool Corporation has handled the industry and that the Reserve Price plan is doomed. Belatedly a majority of wool growers, in terms of volume of wool produced, now realise how badly the Australian Wool Corporation, Wool Council and the International Wool Secretariat have served them in recent years. These people are militantly keen to get rid of the present systems. </PARA>
<PARA>An illustration of the intellectual bankruptcy of the AWC and the Wool Council is the proposal to impose quotas on wool production. They cannot devise an equitable management scheme and it is doubtful if the government will provide the necessary legislation for its implementation. As a member of the government I will certainly vote against any quota proposal. Australia is poised for a complete reorganisation of its wool industry. It is just as much in Europe's interest as ours that we get it right. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>Federal Member for Kalgoorlie</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Frankly, although the honourable member did make some sensible observations, he did say-and honourable members should not forget the date: 19 January of this year-that `the Reserve Price plan is doomed'. That letter was translated into Italian and appeared in the local newspapers. For the benefit of the House, I have a copy with me of the two Italian articles which refer to that particular situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say to the House: is it any wonder that manufacturers were no longer buying Australian wool when they no longer had the confidence that the price which they were paying could be accurately reflected in the final price that they would obtain for their finished product? We all know-we have been told by the AWC for most of last year-that the pipeline was virtually empty and therefore the industry had to come back. We waited and waited but, apart from a short blip in the early stages of this financial year, the industry did not return to the wool markets of Australia. It did not do so because of that fundamental problem of lack of confidence in our marketing situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, one of the proposals which the Opposition strongly supports in this context is the handling of the stockpile. While, on the one hand, we are now proceeding towards an open market system for the sale of wool on a regular rotational basis, on the other hand, we are still facing the problem of massive over-production in the past which is reflected in the existing stockpile. We are firmly of the view that unless that stockpile can be gradually allowed onto the market on a regular basis, underwritten by regulations approved by this Parliament, there is no prospect that the overseas consumers of our wool will be prepared to trust the market because they will say-and with some justification-`While you talk about a free market for wool, on the one hand, in fact you have the capacity to influence the supply to that market because you have the massive overhang of the wool stockpile'. For all of those reasons, therefore, the Opposition will be moving a range of amendments to this legislation which will strengthen the capacity of the industry to survive and overcome what is indisputably probably the greatest threat to its survival this century. </PARA>
<PARA> The discipline of the marketplace is therefore of fundamental importance. It is important to Australian growers, to our balance of trade and to the survival of this great industry. Above all, the way in which the Government handles this situation will to a large degree determine whether Australian rural people will ever trust the Australian Labor Party again. </PARA>

I do not represent a sheep electorate, but I represent a rural electorate. I am pleased to say that we now have a quite a few small numbers of sheep. We always see them at the local shows. I am very pleased to offer a trophy at each of the local shows to encourage the industry, simply because I believe that the sheep industry is our most important rural industry. That is why I wish to make a few comments this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could condemn the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), but enough has been said about him. He has had to look into a crystal ball to see the future that the industry will face. I will not condemn the Australian Wool Corporation; I could, but that has been done. It has failed in many respects. I do not know whether the Minister has received the proper advice from his departmental experts; I would question it. I know that he is not receiving the proper advice from the people within the Government. This particularly applies to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), because various factors, as outlined by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) earlier this evening, have militated against the success of not only the wool industry but also other primary industries in Australia. The value of the dollar is a very important factor indeed. Interest rates and the consumer price index are reflected in the problems confronting the wool industry at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry, in 1972, on the introduction of the Wool Industry Act. The important thing to remember is that the Government of the day did not force that Act upon the growers of Australia. If one reads that speech carefully, one finds out about the Crawford report and the Randall report and one finds that the wool industry generally put pressure upon the Government of the day for a stabilisation scheme. The contents of that legislation were good. Everything in the legislation is very sound. But as has been indicated by Opposition members, it is true that the changes made in 1987 were not in the interests of the industry generally within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally agree with the auction system. It is a good system. We can get collusion within the system. But because of the Corporation's work, it was able, over a period, month in and month out, to see a regular flow of certain quality wools come onto the market. This cut out the fluctuations that were occurring beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very sad that the floor price for wool has virtually gone. It is a backward move. I am sorry to see the Wool Corporation in trouble. I have a great conviction, as have the members of my Party, that organised marketing for primary industry, if requested by that industry, is essential for its stability. This is terribly important. We should have free markets if it is possible to have them; I do not oppose that. But if an industry-whether it be cane, dairy, wool or beef-wants support by way of a stabilised market, it ought to get it. I predict that in days ahead, when the stockpile has gone, there will be other problems of climates and markets throughout the world that will affect the Australian wool growers. They will come to whichever government is in power and say that they want a stabilisation scheme. As sure as night follows day, we will see this happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural industries are very important to Australia's economy. They are now going down. All we need is a world recession and this country will be in trouble. The effects of what is happening in the wool industry-the price stability, the prices over the next year to 18 months that the grower has to accept-will be reflected in every household in this country. Whether one is in the city or out in the villages in the countryside, it will be reflected because of our strong conviction that the primary industries, along with the mining industries, are the important ones that we have to consider today. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were to criticise the Minister, I would criticise him about the income equalisation deposits-IEDs. It is a great shame that they were abolished for eight years-although they have been brought back. As the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) said this afternoon-I listened most intently to his excellent speech-they would have provided some stability in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to promote our product. Are we business people? There are ways and means of stimulating demand throughout the world. We have a product that the world wants, because we produce the best fine wool in the world. We are very proud of this. I was in Russia only 18 months ago. We met the wool people there. They are buying a certain number of rams from Australia-perhaps all that they are allowed to buy. They want to cross our rams-both for carcass and for quality of wool-with their ewes. We are in demand. It is a top product. We have to arrange the forward finance, particularly Russia's and China's, so that they can buy, and to ensure continuity of supply. We have to encourage the industry to export, and we have to sell on consignment. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> A while ago I was stimulated to hear the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) questioning the reasons why we do not process more. Look what we are selling from the mining industry. We are selling coal, copper and iron ore around the world, and we are importing steel. Do we not have a large shipbuilding company in Australia today? All these people are being vitally affected. We have technology. We can learn from the rest of the world. Why can we not process our products and encourage private firms and individuals to process the products that we produce here, particularly wool? We have to think that way, but until now we have not. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospects can change. The price has been too high; but it can change overnight. China and Russia are not buying because of their economies. We have to assist them to buy. The currency in China does not assist them as currency assists the Japanese. It pays the Japanese to buy the wool even at that very high price of 870c per kilogram because of the value of the yen compared with the dollar. But the Japanese are businessmen. They will take advantage of what is happening in the industry and of what the Government and the Wool Corporation have been saying to our buyers around the world for the last year. They can see the opportunity to buy cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> We must freeze the stockpile and create flexibility to meet demand in the marketplace. That would be the ideal situation. Even if the 2 1/2 million bales of wool are sold in the next four months, that would still leave one million bales unsold which would have to be accounted for. I know the Minister has provided for this situation within the legislation, which we support. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the National Party is letting the Australian wool grower know that we are behind him, and he should have no doubts about our thinking. I commend the shadow Minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for the way that he has handled the wool industry. I also commend the right honourable member for New England for the speech he made this evening in which he provided a detailed background to the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the brains to represent wool growers in the way they should be represented in the marketplace, because we recognise their value to Australia and to the standard of living of every person in this country. What we must do is give back to the growers their confidence in the wool industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could reflect on the words of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) earlier this evening-this is the most tragic issue that has arisen in the Parliament since I became a member in 1984. The virtual collapse of the wool industry has caused enormous pain in my electorate, especially on Kangaroo Island, where the farmers have no real alternative livelihood. It has caused great pain in the Adelaide Hills, the Fleurieu Peninsula and out in the Mallee, and that pain comes home very strongly when one sits down with the wool growers and goes through the financial crisis that they all face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a broader sense, this has always been Australia's greatest industry. It is an industry that has always been supported by hard-working, honest and decent growers who have provided-as all honourable members would agree-the underlying stability of the whole of our society. It is a tragedy that this situation should have occurred as a result-as is so often the case in history-of folly. It was great folly for the Australian Wool Corporation-previously the Wool Council-with the blessing of the Government, to abandon the original philosophy of the reserve price scheme, and over a period of just two years to increase the floor price by a massive 72 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government and the Corporation were about at that time was an attempt to suspend the laws of supply and demand. On 14 May in this House I made a speech about the International Tin Council and the collapse of the Tin Council scheme. I warned then that the wool industry faced exactly the same problems because there was exactly the same attempt to try to suspend the laws of supply and demand. It has never been done in history, it was not done in the case of the Tin Council and it has not been done here. In the case of the Tin Council, 40 per cent of Malaysian tin companies went broke. In the case of the wool industry, we do not know yet how many growers will go broke but we are frightened the numbers will be very large. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of artificially manipulating the floor price scheme led to an accumulated stockpile of nearly five million bales-that is to date-and a build-up of debt to date of a massive $2.8 billion, which has been left to the individual growers. The Australian Wool Corporation and the Government tried to argue last year in particular that the wool industry was not sensitive to price movements. That was one of the most absurd arguments I have ever heard in my time as a member of parliament. It seemed incredible that one industry would somehow not be sensitive to changes in price. It was believed that we could hang on to the old 870c floor price, artificially increased to such a dramatic extent, and that that would not affect demand for our wool. It obviously did. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited China as part of a Liberal Party delegation late last year I came across not only Chinese buyers but also a representative of the Australian Wool Corporation in Hong Kong. The representative of the Corporation gave me a piece of paper and on that piece of paper were these words, which I thought were very chilling in the context of a debate in which at least some people were arguing that wool was not price sensitive:</PARA>
<PARA>South American wool has been imported by China for many years and has always been imported at a discount to Australian wool due to differences in quality. The price differential, however, has widened recently, largely attributable to the competition between South American wool exporters causing downward pressure on prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The point of that submission from the Wool Corporation and the message we heard in China was that the relatively high price of Australian wool compared with that of South American wool had led to the Chinese buying more South American wool and less Australian wool. I mention that only as evidence that this is an industry which, like every other industry in the world, is sensitive to price and that the demand for the product will be affected therefore by the price that is asked for that product. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to all these problems with the floor price scheme, the industry had imposed on it this quite absurd high interest rate policy, which has not only increased the grower's day to day expenses but has also artificially pushed up the value of the Australian dollar. In addition, there has been a whole raft of Commonwealth and State taxes and charges which have fallen so heavily on those wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to say that the Opposition has done everything it could since May last year to try to help develop demand for Australian wool. Firstly, the Opposition exposed the failure on 8 May 1990 of the Soviet Union to pay its debts to the Australian wool industry. Opposition representatives had meetings with officials from the Soviet Embassy. The Opposition called on Government members such as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) to intervene to try to get the Soviets to meet those payments. They finally began to react many months after our original calls. </PARA>
<PARA> In May the Opposition called for changes to the insurance scheme for wool exporters to the Soviet Union, and at the time the Government ridiculed that call. Later the Opposition proposed a range of credit arrangements and counter-trade, which the Opposition believed would help redevelop demand for Australian wool in the Soviet Union. Admittedly the Government finally adopted policies similar to those the Opposition had been calling for well before the Government acted. However, if only the Government had acted in time it would have done something to stimulate demand for wool in the Soviet Union. The Government stands condemned for sitting on its hands and doing so little when the Opposition was calling for so much to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, both the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia separately led delegations to China. Those delegations covered a range of issues but in particular they concentrated upon ways of encouraging the Chinese back into the wool market. It is worth reflecting that we were again ridiculed by the Government for going to China, yet when we got there we had the opportunity to speak with Ministers, officials, Chinese technicians, representatives of Chinese woollen mills and the like. They were initiatives that we took well in advance of the Government and they were ridiculed by the Government, but ultimately the Government realised that it would have to follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition did a great deal to try to encourage the Chinese and the Soviets to return to the market. It is a matter of deep regret that the Government responded in such an adverse, party political way to many of the suggestions we made. I only hope the Government will not react in such an adverse and party political way to the suggestions we have made today to try to help contribute to resolving the wheat subsidy problems in relation to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The supply side of the story of the wool industry has always been enormously important. It should always be remembered that one must get the supply and demand curves to meet somewhere. If one wanted to maintain the 700c floor price, one had to reduce supply as well. We proposed a slaughter scheme, recognising that something like 45 million sheep would have to be slaughtered if the supply and demand curves were going to meet at 700c. </PARA>
<PARA> The result was that there was virtually no action at all on the part of the Government and, for that matter, the Wool Corporation. Yes, they introduced a scheme, but a scheme which politely could only be described as a `wet scheme'. They added to that the system of quotas which, as other speakers have pointed out, was absolutely riddled with anomalies and, in the case of my own State of South Australia, quotas which were particularly discriminatory and particularly harsh. At least they have now gone. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have to ask ourselves: what should we do now? How can we encourage confidence to return to the market? The Government has interim measures; the issue is still not resolved. The Government has had a long time to resolve this issue and it keeps introducing interim schemes. Now is the time to finalise the issue and the Government should do that, first of all, by terminating altogether the reserve price scheme. It should freeze the stockpile for 12 months and dispose of it subsequently according to a legislated timetable so that the international marketplace knows exactly how much wool from the stockpile is going to come onto the market at any given time. If we do not do that, we will end up with chaos. As far as the debt of the Corporation and the growers is concerned, the Government apparently wants to blow that out by between $700m and $1 billion. We will only support increases in borrowings of $200m, otherwise the debts will just destroy the growers for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, my colleagues and I do not oppose this Bill because we do not want to jeopardise the $300m from the Government in supplementary payments to those growers who will be selling their wool between now and the end of the season. I come back to where I began. In the 10 minutes that I have had, I guess the point above all that I have endeavoured to get across here is that there is enormous pain, enormous sorrow and enormous anguish in rural Australia, including my own electorate. I have been very struck by the tears, the concerns and the worries of so many wool growers in my electorate. So many of these problems have been caused by the macro-economic policies of this Government; its short-sightedness; and its decisions to make politically expedient judgments, rather than judgments in the long term interests of the industry, and for that it stands roundly condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The economic earthquake which has hit the wool industry with the collapse of the reserve floor price scheme has not just affected wool producers themselves. It has reverberated throughout the entire economy. It has struck most directly at the confidence of the entire spectrum of rural industries, and it has struck those primary industries at a time when their future in the wider context of Australia's economy has never seemed so perilous. The Parliament must not forget that in dealing with the profound issue-the fate of the Australian wool industry-it is dealing with an entire sector of the economy, and it is dealing with a community which has had its livelihood virtually torn out from under it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shock waves will impact throughout all of regional and rural Australia. Overall spending emanating from the rural sector will fall $5 billion. Some $1.2 billion of this will be taken out of the regional towns. The small businesses which service the rural sector will be threatened, as primary producers themselves are, by the deepening of the rural crisis. It will also spill over into the supply network, from farm machinery to fertiliser companies, which draw their economic life from the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has always seen the primary industries as playing nothing more than an annoying and subsidiary role to its preoccupation with the so-called mainstream industries. In the matter of the management of Government policy applying to the wool industry, this is more than patently obvious. The policy approach to wool has been characterised by sheer carelessness. The fact that the industry is now driven to embrace a drastic and radical solution to its problems is largely a legacy of the chaos which has been at the heart of the Government's rural policy process. </PARA>
<PARA> We know, for instance, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) recognised the dire plight of Australia's wool producers as early as last October. We know that since then he has not struck a policy direction. It is no wonder that the floor price scheme cracked wide open. It is no wonder that growers are left picking up the pieces of an industry shattered by the collapse in confidence of international buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part, the coalition has stuck hard and fast to a 700c floor price. It sought an effective stock reduction program which would have seen the supply problems affecting the industry become more manageable. It wanted to give the industry every conceivable chance to hold its own in the marketplace. It wanted to give growers and producers the chance to keep their mastery over their own economic destinies. In difficult times, this was a difficult course of action, but not in itself an impossible one. Prevarication on the part of the Minister and policy uncertainty struck at the credibility of the scheme and, in the context of the range of other supply and demand problems facing the industry, credibility was a key issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the management of the crisis was such that others directly connected with the industry have also been financially savaged by the suspension of the reserve price scheme. The various State based private treaty wool merchants have been appallingly hurt by the policy turnarounds of recent days. Many of these private treaty wool merchants carry huge inventories, relatively speaking. Though reeling from losses under the earlier floor price reduction of last year-the 870c to 700c reduction-they, like everyone else in the industry, read the Minister's assurances that all was well with the current floor price. Now the asset values of these inventories have been slashed. Moreover, these private wool traders face very substantial losses. </PARA>
<PARA> I call upon the Minister to clarify the status of the private buyers and just where, if at all, they fit within the operation of the supplementary payments scheme. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the minds of private treaty merchants at present. I have private buyers, located at Leongatha, Yarram and Bairnsdale in my electorate, who are extremely concerned about their economic future. Indeed, I spent Saturday morning last with the Leongatha buyers who have been in the business for many, many years-Ansell Biggs and now his son Ross-and I am very worried having had a look in their shed at the huge stockpile which they, being very small business people, have now to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> The shake-out which now faces the wool industry is utterly unparalleled. It will come to represent a massive forced restructuring of an entire industry sector. The coalition now has little choice but to side with the course of action which ensures the long term viability of the industry in its changed economic context. While the reserve price scheme in different circumstances might have had a continuing and important role in industry marketing measures, it is now an ineffective instrument for defending producer interest. To go on accumulating debt, expanding quotas and increasing levies would have laid the industry to waste. Wool producers must now face the future as best they can. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation itself now accepts that objectivity and the best road for the wool industry to take under the circumstances is the open market. On its own reckoning, the Wool Corporation has determined that the quickest road back to stability for the wool industry is by dismantling the minimum price scheme as it has previously operated. The Vines committee might well find some half-way house, a scheme tailored closely to market realities as they have emerged, but the orderly marketing scheme as it functioned in the past has been crippled. It is a profoundly regrettable course of action. It will cause immense suffering. But now there is no choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Difficult as it is to admit, the real problems for the wool industry are only just beginning. Those growers who are yet to sell at auction over the remainder of the 1990-91 season will find some measure of assistance by way of the deficiencies payment scheme, $300m of which will be met from the Commonwealth funding. But the burden of the industry's supply problem will not be easily evaded. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers will remain responsible for the $2.8 billion or 4.8 million bale stockpile and the corresponding debt management strategies arising from interest repayments-$450m a year-and storage costs. They will have to meet the additional deficiency repayments which break beyond the $300m mark. In the context of the extension of the industry's borrowing limits, we can anticipate that this scheme may blow out to $1 billion. What that amount would finally be is impossible to determine, and that in itself is a grave source of concern to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences for wool growers will be enormous. Struggling to meet debt repayments on a huge stockpile, in addition to the burden of a further $700m in loans to cover the deficiency payment scheme, growers cannot be expected to cope. Three-quarters of Australia's farmers are already carrying debt. Twenty per cent of total gross income for 1990-91 is spent on interest repayments. How many growers can be expected to pull through as the debt burden gets even heavier? Assuming that the wool industry exercises its expanded borrowing rights, levies and debt servicing will remain a part of the wool sector's life for years to come. On this basis, I warn the House that this is only the first of many occasions to come upon which it will be forced to return to debate this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis in the wool industry and its consequences will be felt well beyond this single day and well after this particular debate has concluded. To be frank, I do not see a way out of it at this time. The easy avenue would appear to be for the industry to obtain an enhanced efficiency payout under the supplementary payments scheme, but this might total $1 billion. On this basis, the industry would be receiving from the Commonwealth and from the taxpayers of Australia a $700m liability because taxpayers would be providing a guarantee. It totals $1 billion, being a $300m cash transfer and a $700m borrowing guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would appreciate that the cash transfer will not buy equity of any kind. It will simply be a cash payment of such a magnitude that, should the $700m be called upon in the future, will tie the hands of future governments for years to come in respect of their broader fiscal strategies. In essence, it would set future governments back years in addressing key economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite their central role in the economy-especially the precarious small export sectors-the agricultural industries have come to feel themselves strangers in their own land. For the present Government, agriculture is a symbol of the past and nothing else. In its worst financial moments, at its deepest point of economic malaise, the wool industry alone is still a multi-billion dollar industry which overshadows all the other hype that the Government can muster about the so-called Australian manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is fixated with appeasing its metropolitan constituency, fixated by its industrial unionised political base. The Government has only ever considered farming and farmers as peripheral concerns. Look at the Government's preoccupation with the manufacturing sector and its concentration on protection levels propping up the automotive industries and the like. Here the Government is pumping its resources into an economic sector pump primed by tariff and other protection and soon to be injected with another shot of economic steroids come 12 March. Here it is unable to impose a comprehensive economic plan on an automotive industry which has sucked enormous funds from domestic consumers for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always looked upon rural Australia as an alien constituency. If it were more than this, if there were some genuine commitment which recognised the objective economic significance of the agricultural industries-wheat and cereal grains, wool, dairying, citrus and beef-then there might have been some concerted effort to improve their cost structures; that is, there might have been a drive to reduce that array of added cost which clings to the industry and threatens to strangle its long term viability. </PARA>
<PARA> The agricultural industries have suffered decline in terms of trade-that is, the ratio of input costs to the value of production-which have ballooned out in the past seven years. On every other conceivable economic indicator, the rural sector has been hit harder than any other area of economic activity. Its asset values have collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to a conclusion because of the time limits imposed upon all of us. There is so much to be said with regard to the problems surrounding the great wool industry. There is obviously no quick solution to the problems. The wool industry has had to operate in a highly uneconomic environment. The settings are all wrong. The problems are not so much with the wool producers as with what happens off the farm-the cost of capital, interest rates, transport and handling, cost of fuel and problems with the waterfront. This Government has been sidestepping the real problems for far too long and the longer it delays deep reform the more the next generation will inherit a profoundly inefficient economy. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to the wool industry? All sorts of circumstances have brought it to its knees, but those problems have been accentuated by a highly inefficient and poorly structured and administered economy. Wool producers today face a very uncertain and, for many of them, grim future. Whatever decisions this Parliament makes, not all wool producers will be saved-and that is a matter of the utmost responsibility and concern for this Parliament. </PARA>

I must stand on behalf of my constituents and make a comment or two because of the predominance of my electorate in the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the major stud farms are located in my electorate. It is not only on behalf of those major and well known studs that I rise tonight but also on behalf of the thousands of small farmers who are so concerned and perplexed about what has happened to Australia's premier rural industry. I endorse the sentiments of the honourable member for Murray, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) whose farmers have also been perplexed about what is happening to Australia's premier rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics forecast that in all probability the wool industry had nothing but a rosy future ahead of it. Now the outlook is devastating. Along with most of my colleagues, I have sat around the kitchen table with farmers who poured out to us-as no doubt they have to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)-the pain they are feeling at the grim reality of bankruptcy in what a couple of years ago looked like a buoyant industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to stand here tonight and apportion blame. It is easy to suggest that the Australian Wool Corporation should have made different decisions or that the Wool Council of Australia should have been more representative of its constituency. It is easy to blame the Government, and the Government cannot be excused from the sort of interest rate policy that has so exacerbated the difficulties that farmers are facing. However, there are some grim realities that none of us can escape. It is easy with the benefit of hindsight to suddenly get 20:20 vision. The truth is that a lot of the decisions that were made were wrong. These decisions were made by everyone-the farmers, members of the Government, members of the Opposition and those who represented the farmers in the Wool Council and the Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a couple of minutes I want to place two grim realities on the record. The first grim reality that every farmer recognises and that we as legislators have had to come to terms with is this: we cannot keep buying without selling. That was particularly true when the floor price for wool was 870c and, sadly, it remained true when the floor price was dropped to 700c. As has been said by every participant in this debate, the debt that the Wool Corporation must currently service on behalf of farmers to outside lending authorities sits at about $2.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that we are considering tonight contains the potential to increase that debt to $3.5 billion by including the supplementary payments in that debt. The Opposition seeks by its amendments to keep the debt to the Wool Corporation and its farmers to $3 billion. But even that enormous figure will use up something like $400m of farmers' incomes simply to service the interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review suggested that the current debt faced by wool growers around Australia fell out at something like $43,000 for every wool property. Is it any wonder that the honourable member for Gippsland has suggested that this sort of debt will cripple rural towns as we know them? The grim reality we have to face is that unless we freeze the stockpile the realisable value of the stockpile will in fact be lost, because those bales of wool represent relatively little in value until they are frozen and leaked on to the market at what might be seen as an acceptable rate. So we cannot keep buying without selling. The legislation is designed to encourage people to start buying. </PARA>
<PARA> The second grim reality I wish to leave with the House tonight is that we cannot keep producing unless we find markets for this wool. Some 4.8 million bales sit in the stockpile. The Opposition has contended, not only in tonight's debate, but successively-ever since this matter of whether the floor price should be 870c or 700c-that a stock reduction scheme ought to be introduced. As the honourable member for Barker has eloquently said, we have to address the supply side of this industry. We contend that without an adequate slaughter scheme we will continue to be producing wool even while we are here in this chamber addressing the legislation currently before us. It seems to me something of an absurdity that unless the legislation that we are addressing, which is designed to get us to 1 July, is accompanied by an adequate stock reduction measure then until 1 July we will have sheep out in the paddock producing wool that we simply cannot sell. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear that the wool industry has only reinforced the impression that rural Australia has that both the agropoliticians and the party politicians are out of touch with what rural Australia needs. But the irony is that what has been Australia's most valuable individual export industry, which has led Australia as its most valuable rural export industry-the wool industry-currently looks like being a real burden to Australia. That burden exists simply because all of us have failed to see what the wool industry needed. That is a condemnation that we must all bear. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry, once so proudly the key rural industry in Australia, is rapidly being robbed of all its independence. While I have already pleaded with the Government to readdress what has been the major interest rate burden facing this industry over the last five years, I must also plead with the Government to look realistically now not at the industry's capacity to contribute to the economy-that has been lost-but at how it can keep this industry in place through effective rural adjustment schemes and through the employment of additional rural counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term there is also a need for the Government to address the question of income equalisation deposits. They cannot do anything to save this industry now-the industry has no income to deposit. Had an effective income equalisation deposit scheme remained in place, the industry would have been more able to weather the storm it currently faces. I commend to the House the amendments of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In what I understand to be the very few moments left available for this debate, I want to touch on what I see as important issues. At the outset I would like to acknowledge that, as is the case with unemployment and bankruptcies, the ugly statistics inherent in the current wool dilemma ultimately translate into personal hardship and misery for real human beings out there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Currently, Australia's wool growers and their families are feeling an immense amount of pain, and are likely to feel more. Many are understandably emotional. As I have spoken to wool growers over the telephone in recent days, and out in the field in the electorate over the last few weeks, I have been very conscious of a wide range of emotions-confusion, anger, frustration, fear-and perhaps above all else uncertainty about the future, much of which, I might say, stems from the fact that there has been an appalling lack of information flowing to growers from their industry chiefs. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these emotions are understandable as, in common with wheat growers and so many others across our beleaguered nation, these people are deeply worried, not only about their future, but about their children's futures as well. So we need to keep in mind when we are debating issues in this somewhat isolated and insulated chamber in this somewhat isolated and insulated city that we are talking about issues that impact massively on the lives of a very substantial group of Australians out there. We have a responsibility to do everything we can for them not only to ease their short term pain but also to ensure their long term viability, not only for their sakes but for the sake of communities as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As someone who has sought to support the floor price and the selling mechanisms favoured by the industry, I think the first thing to place on the record again tonight is that the scheme, as we have seen it operating, is not the scheme introduced in 1972. The original scheme sought to avoid `undue fluctuation or irregularity'-in the words of the Wool Marketing Act-in prices which were to be at levels appropriate to the comparative position of wool in world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) was to make fortnightly reports to the Minister and to the Treasurer in relation to the reserve prices determined by the Corporation, wool purchased and held by the Corporation and sales reports. At the same time the Minister could, on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth, give a direction in writing to the Corporation with respect to the operation of the reserve price scheme of the Corporation, and the Corporation was obliged to comply with any such direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Marketing Act 1987 not only effectively altered those modest, anti-potholing objectives of the original scheme, but also massively restricted the power of the Minister to direct the AWC, including the power to set the level of the reserve, to the point where the Minister really only retained the power of veto. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) was surely right to refer to this as perhaps his worst mistake. It was a tragic mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> That having been done-on the basis, presumably, that wool industry leaders had matured to the point where they could be allowed greater autonomy-those leaders went on and pushed the reserve price up about 70 per cent in two years, in defiance of all sound economic reasoning and, as I understand it, against all conventional wisdom in relation to charting practice. </PARA>
<PARA> What needs to be understood is that this stupidity was to cost not only traditional wool growers dearly-and I feel especially sorry for those people-but also those who are not traditionally wool growers. That is to say, many people, seeing what appeared to be not only a high but also a guaranteed reserve for wool, moved into wool production in the face of uncertainty and doubt in other farm sectors, particularly the grain industry. Both groups now face a dreadful prospect, and of course a broader rural community will as well as the impact flows on to small businesses and shopkeepers and so forth in small towns. No better example of the disguising of market signals could be found than this one, and ultimately-as is so often the case in these instances-the people most hurt are the ones we wanted to help in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very short time that is available to me-since I would only be rehashing ground that has already been well covered tonight if I spoke about the legislation before us-I wish to consider some positives and the need, as I would see it, to develop a more aggressive, outward looking approach to the future for wool. Without hope there is no future, and the industry must now seek to do all that it can to build a future for itself. Right throughout this unhappy episode it seems to me we have failed to look adequately at the need to get wool out into the marketplace, or into the pipeline-in the terminology that has been used so much. In other words, we have failed to shift more of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest for a start that new leadership is desperately needed, and needed now. Firm control and positive direction are needed-the sort of direction that can achieve, broadly, the following objectives. Firstly, there is a need to protect the production base-that is to say, the 70,000 wool growers in this country-by keeping the wool tax and other impositions as low as possible, which is yet another reason, I would suggest, for keeping a strict cap on the borrowings for funding of supplementary payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a need to carefully allocate adequate research and marketing funding to develop new products, perhaps with new brand names, and to sell them effectively. Thirdly, there is a need to work very hard at establishing genuinely strong and effective levels of value adding in Australia. Herein lies a story of escaped responsibility-the failure of this Government to bring about the reforms needed to restrain costs and to deliver genuine productivity and efficiency improvements in the labour market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was truncating what I had to say. I wanted to go on and say that we have not seen the development of a lean and efficient economy delivering the sort of economic environment that we so desperately need for all of our industries-wool is no exception-to succeed and flourish. Honourable members might be interested to know that only 24 per cent of the wool clip is scoured and only about 5 per cent of it is transformed into textile products in this country. Yet the savings and the potential for higher returns to both growers and the nation from effective value adding are enormous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the current situation involving an oversupply of wool, a desperate need to find new directions and an awareness in the community of the need to improve work practices on the part of the entire community-that has been evidenced by the recent SPC Ltd dispute where workers made it plain that they understood the need for us to change our ways-it seems to me that no better time could possibly exist for the rapid and determined expansion of the industry via the channel of value adding. To achieve this there must be effective leadership, leadership that is able to work effectively with government. On the other hand, the Government must stop stalling in the area of overcoming the problems of labour costs, labour overheads and penalty rates that so blight this particular industry and its attempt to value add. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, pandering to the trade union movement again. I would simply like to wind up by saying that the industry must expect and work towards a prosperous future again. If there is a message at a personal level for wool growers it is that with the right attitudes they have every hope of hanging on to their financial viability and certainly to their personal lives and to their family lives. With the wrong attitudes they will put all three at risk. It is critical to remember in the current circumstances that this is no time for quitting. If the industry is to have a future it must be one which is determinedly seized by all those involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though I am not closing the debate, I thank all the members who have spoken. It has been a very interesting and full debate. There has not been all that much repetition. Many people have said that it is a sad day and used words such as `tragic'. We would be less than honest and less than human if we did not fully understand that whatever decision was taken, whether we continued with this situation that we are in or followed the path that we now are on, the impact on individuals would be very great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said before that by far this is the most difficult and important decision I have ever made for Australia's farm industries. There has been a lot of talk about what my mistake was. My mistake certainly was to give the power to set the minimum reserve price to the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia. When this was debated in 1987 there was no opposition about giving industries their own way. I just looked up some of the debate. Leading for the Opposition at that time the then honourable member for Gwydir praised the Bill very much. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill aims to place the Corporation on a sound commercial footing. </PARA>
<PARA>He had some concerns about my setting up a statutory selection committee. He said that the industry was quite capable of choosing its own people. The only objection the honourable member for Gwydir had at that time was that he did not like my putting in place some equal employment opportunity bits and pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), still the present member, was even more adulatory. In contrast to what he said today, he then said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation is a success and there are simple reasons for that. From the beginning it was a very enlightened statutory authority. It is not one that has worked on the old arrangement of being totally subservient to government. This legislation gives it substantially more independence and autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA>................... </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Corporation to date deserves the congratulations of this Parliament for the wonderful job they have done. It is now quite sensible and proper that the apron strings should be untied for the Australian Wool Corporation because it has been a success. </PARA>
<PARA>The then honourable member for Ryan said:</PARA>
<PARA>We also welcome the way in which the Government has backed away from intrusion in the industry . . . This is a contribution to the deregulation of government corporations and a contribution to an industry which is very highly regarded throughout Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The then honourable member for Maranoa was also very supportive and said that I was not going far enough in getting the Government out of the industry. We all learn with hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA> My mistake was in believing that this was an industry that could take mature long term commercial decisions. My mistake was in trying to get the Government out of the industry and not to exert paternalism or patronage. My mistake was in believing that the concepts of a corporate board, commercial flexibility and accountability would be comprehended by the Wool Council of Australia. The Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation's mistake was to lift the minimum reserve price by 71 per cent over two years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have qualified my comments on several occasions. We would have had the same problems, or some problems, even if the reserve price had been held at 508c. The board of the Wool Corporation under Mr Hugh Beggs has to understand, and has understood, that in its dealings with government it is not negotiating with government on behalf of growers but exercising its best judgment as a statutory marketing authority of the Commonwealth Government. But anyhow, we all learn. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to people who have spoken in this debate. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) called for my resignation. If I resigned at this point it would be rather silly. The most important thing is to fix it up. People have been all over the shop on this issue. A majority has said that we should have acted more quickly. There are other people who say we not should have done it at all, that is, remove the reserve price scheme. The contrasts were the honourable member for O'Connor and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the first principles in buffer stock schemes in commerce in general are that markets set the price and that buffer stock schemes always fail. If we control price without controlling supply we are bound to get substitution. What we have been doing in the wool industry for a long time is similar to what has been done in Europe with the common agricultural policy and what the United States did in the early 1980s with wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> To the `go fast to wipe it out, 1 July 1990 brigade' I simply say that the decision has been no easier now qualitatively; it is just as difficult a decision. Quantitatively, it would have been better to have taken the decision then. Politically, I believe it would have been impossible to wipe out a scheme that has survived for 17 years last July. There is real depth to the view of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the person with the most experience and knowledge here, the right honourable member for New England, full well remembers the heated debate in the 1960s and the early 1970s when the government of the day acted against the industry because of the situation in which they were placed. I think there was a deficiency payments scheme, the price had slumped to 29c a pound and they made it up to 36c. </PARA>
<PARA> What we face after these 17 years where it has worked has been an unique set of circumstances. The Wool Council of Australia is still dead set opposed to the Government's action. It basically believes it runs the Australian Wool Corporation. I think it would be fair to say that the majority of members on the Australian Wool Corporation board are still opposed to the Government's action, though they did resolve in terms of the fact that I could not guarantee I could get quota legislation through the Parliament nor could we continue to go on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the position in which I am placed, I understand full well that the Government does not control the Senate. The legislation that we put through on dairying was delayed for a year. There are matters relating to fisheries and sugar that get blocked in the Senate. I know full well that unless there is a fair degree of industry acceptance out there, no government has a chance of getting really rapid and radical change. I can do arithmetic; I have been very well aware of the arithmetic. I set up Sir William Vines, a man of enormous status in his industry, to look at the longer term because I knew that this industry had long term problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the go-faster brigade, it was worth trying to hold the price. I did not go to 600c on 1 July last year, particularly because of the situation with the European buyers. It was worth a go. We asked the Corporation to give us a business plan and then a strategic plan. But the market went very bad through August and September with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and all the things that were happening in the Soviet Union through that period. We introduced legislation. I went on an overseas mission and offered the roll-over credit facility to the Soviet Union. I think all that was worth a go. I was trying to demonstrate that if the reserve price scheme had to go, by then it would be obvious and accepted by many-certainly by the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that we need to wrap it all up now. I simply say that the reserve price scheme is the centrepiece to the institutional framework of this industry. We would be absolutely stupid to scuttle the institutions of this industry now. To the `never remove the reserve price scheme' brigade I would say this: we tried everything to hold the reserve price scheme. We started off a bit over a year ago with a 4 per cent wool levy to pay for the reserve price scheme. Then it was 10 per cent and then 15 per cent. We legislated for it to be 20 per cent and the Council and the Corporation fixed it at 18. Then we moved to 25 per cent and now the proposal is 35 per cent with an upper limit of 50 per cent. So it has gone from 4 to possibly 35 per cent. No-one can accuse us of not trying to stick to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The word `immutable' comes up. I was in exactly the same position as the Treasurer (Mr Keating), with a fixed exchange rate that simply has to hold the line until it is impossible to hold it any longer. Some things in all this terrible, tragic mess could have been foreseen-that once we floated the currency, the reserve price scheme was going to have to be fundamentally changed. I do not have a clear knowledge, but I know that work was done in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and that this was put before the board. </PARA>
<PARA> We could foresee the response to the high prices through 1988 in terms of customer demand and, of course, we could foresee that 870c would give us larger supply. It is also certain that some of the research and development funds could have been better applied to market analysis and the reserve price scheme itself and that work could have been better integrated on the International Wool Secretariat. But we could not anticipate the collapse of communism in eastern Europe; we could not anticipate what has happened in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and is still unfolding today; nor the way that China moved to free up the economy and then to put the checks back on. The warm northern winters, changes in the structure of the world textile industries, more latterly the invasion of Kuwait, and now recessions in the United Kingdom and the United States were obviously caused by the Australian Treasurer!</PARA>
<PARA> But at some time we had to change course. The Australian Wool Corporation deferred sales. There was a view around that once we started heading for five or six million bales and a $3 billion to $4 billion debt, we really had to start thinking again. By January the business plan was shot to pieces. Quite frankly, I met with the Wool Corporation on 21 January, we thought there were sufficient funds available to get through to March and April-that is, sufficient up to $3 billion. We were prepared to go further; as honourable members know, the $3 billion was uncapped. But, once we started the 55 per cent buy-in rate, in about the third week of January, once we were getting well away from the business plan that required only a 28 per cent buy-in rate, we had to do a fundamental reassessment. It was not March or April; it was virtually the next week, on 24 January. </PARA>
<PARA> There was very legitimate opposition to quotas. I will stand by the words. They would have been murderously difficult to introduce and it would have been just as bloody as the scheme we are trying to put in place now on supplementary payments. All I am saying is that at some time we had to change. If we do not sell 45 to 50 per cent of product two years in a row, and still have the second-biggest year's production on record on our hands, if we are going for $4 billion plus borrowings, which is close to one year's average revenue, and heading for six to eight million bales in stock five years out-that is, heading for over one to 1 1/2 years production, and this after five years levy at 35 per cent-at some time we have to change. The figures and the various projections show that a 600 kilograms quota at 35 per cent tax is 314c; yet we are selling at 700c. For 700 million kilograms at 35 per cent tax, people are really getting about 341c gross, and still selling at 700c. They are thus encouraging fibre substitution and encouraging the world to move away from wool. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know what the previous Government in New Zealand had to do with its meat industry plan: it had to put in $1 billion to bail the industry out. All of this was a question of judgment, a question of balance. It was an extremely difficult decision. My first experience with the wool industry was through 1971-72, when I was on sheep properties throughout Australia on the objective measurement project. I know full well what they went through in the years leading up to that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reflect on some of the contributions of honourable members. Everyone has put a lot of work into this. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the Deputy Leader of the National Party, said that this was hastily drawn up. Yes, we had about a week to act. Officials worked night and day, for the reasons I have just explained. We had to get the proposal through Cabinet. There was no sense in bringing it in any earlier than last Thursday, because the Opposition had to have some chance to assess what the Government was proposing. I think the legislation is fine, and the Government will be opposing the amendments, but we had to act very quickly. That is why we have not got all the measures in place now that we have taken the decisions we have. The members of the Government are not the experts. I have half of the wool division with me in the House tonight, so those opposite should not think they will suddenly go down and run the Wool Corporation, as the honourable member for O'Connor thinks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party is quite right about all the reasons for the collapse, about Sir William Vines allegedly putting forward propositions of 500c-which he denies-the allegations about the letter by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the sales by the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics submission to the Vines inquiry and Madam Davletova's cancelled trip. But really what was causing this skittishness was the size of the stockpile and people doing their sums about whether the industry, and eventually the Government, the taxpayers, could carry this debt. That was the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I could answer many points made by previous speakers. The politics of the wool industry are quite profound. I understand that. This is probably the most powerful, oldest established and most sophisticated industry. As I have said already, there is lot of depth in the view that the reserve price scheme be kept; I do not think the Government could have moved any more quickly and I think we had to stay with this scheme as long as we could. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor says that we have to take over and put in a receiver. Who the heck do we put in when we have a core of people there who know how to do things? There has been a lot of editorial comment about that-the absurd unreality of the Government stepping in and just taking over next Monday. The reason why the Government did not take over the stockpile-quite apart from 2.8 billion reasons-is that, if the Government hangs onto the stockpile and then starts putting it on the market, the allegation would be immediate that we would be taking the market down. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think 70 to 80 per cent of graziers in Australia are opposed to this legislation; the Wool Council of Australia, of course, is still writing in and I am getting a lot of cards and letters. The Wool Corporation has announced tonight, quite precisely, what is happening to the stockpile. That will require me to issue guidelines later this week under the Wool Marketing Act as amended. I will be doing this. These are quite tough stock disposal rules. What will have to be put in place before the start of the next season is an arrangement whereby the stockpiles treatment can be transparent. There needs to be some flexibility, but it needs to be very predictable. We will arrive at that position when we move for more legislation during April and May in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> By the start of sales, hopefully next Monday, we will need to have rules and guidelines on how a supplementary payment scheme will work. Of course, that is an enormous amount of work to be done indeed. My officials and the Australian Wool Corporation are working through that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) talked about value adding. All I can say is that Senator Button and I have done three reports on this matter. It is an old chestnut and the honourable member should read those reports because it is not all that easy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) commented on the question of the reserve price scheme (RPS) providing stability. Yes, but since the float of the dollar, one cannot have stability of price in overseas countries and Australian currency at the same time. We now have a chance for ultimate stability with the treatment of that stockpile itself. Right now we are working on how long it is held for, how the debt is rescheduled and whether we put the paper out into longer borrowings or roll it over more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not tolerate too much criticism of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. All the estimates are based on assumptions at the time. ABARE, and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics before it, basically got this a lot more right than a lot of people in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa also raised the question of a full time or part time chairman. I have always been of the view that the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Corporation should have a full time chairman but it all depends on the role of the managing director and whether the board is prepared to act corporately or sees itself as a servant of wool growers only. I think it is very important that we understand the relationship between a chairman and a managing director. I will not go any further into that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa-I am giving him a bit of time because he knows a lot about it-raised this question about immutability. No-one will believe my word on other commodities. Wool was the only commodity where we tried to set the prices. It is the only commodity where we are pricemakers in any sense. For the rest we are really pricetakers on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa commented on the stockpile and freezing, and referred to the New Zealand situation and its stockpile. There is only about a 5 per cent to 10 per cent coincidence with New Zealand wool and ours. Most of it is Romney and about 35 micron and up. I have only a nitpicking comment with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought the honourable member for Barker was basically right on everything he said, including his comments on the income equalisation deposits (IED) scheme. I think it would have been best to have had a non-rortable or slightly rortable IED scheme. However, the honourable member for Barker's major criticism was really to try to get a better supplementary payment scheme. All I can say is that the alternative is nearly impossible. We put more dollars in, put the levy up or get less for the grower. As I said, we are still working out the guidelines and we will certainly have those together by next Monday. However, if we have a cap on this money, it implies we will have to wait until 30 June to get a full accounting and then it would have to be distributed. Some people might accept that but I think it would be very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Like everyone else, I have run out of time. I am sure we could all talk for hours on this industry. It is Australia's greatest primary industry and it is a very sad day but in the end I hope this will be shown to be a very necessary day. (Extension of time granted) I am overcome, Mr Deputy Speaker. This has never happened to me before. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) raised the question of early shearing and double presentation of wool. As a result of events leading up to 30 June last year, we have a natural hedge against that. A lot of wool was shorn early then. By specifying a range of types and by putting in possible severe penalties, which is the reason for another item in the legislation which the Opposition is seeking to amend, we might be able to obviate all those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) gave a very good and detailed history of this. He said that the supplementary payment scheme is a de facto reserve price scheme. I have to say no, that it is really about intraseasonal equity and also equity within these past four or five months. There have been a very large proportion of fine wool clips-and big ones at that-while from Queensland there are some very big clips of quite coarse wool. It is intraseasonal within the past four months if one looks at the composition of the clips themselves. The honourable member for Corangamite says they will have to come back in June. We will be back in April-May. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England said that I had looked at the arithmetic in excess and then gave his own arithmetic-and I am not saying that in any sort of smart alec way. As I said earlier, he fully understands the depth of and the concerns in this debate and its long history. I do take the view that the exchange rate has particularly exacerbated the problem for export industries. To my mind, the exchange rate in Australia is not related enough to the current account deficit and demand for foreign exchange. Too much emphasis is placed on asset values and speculation in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that there was a 60 per cent tariff on cool wool material. We did decrease the 35 per cent tariff to zero per cent on 125 grams per square metre cloth and below, but for over 125 grams per square metre the tariff rate is 35 per cent for wool and cotton and 40 per cent for synthetic. In the upcoming industry statement, perhaps we can look at that again. He said that we ought to stimulate sales. As with the last component of Sir William Gunn's plans, we can in any case do that whatever scheme we put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> As to contracts and wool importers, I do not think we will have the situation we had with the 20 per cent drop where people could calculate exactly what the drop was going to be. With a free market, in the next week or two we are going to see a great movement away from the excessive prices of the reserve price scheme to wool being priced on the basis of demand. We will probably see the value of some types of wool go up and the value of other types go down. </PARA>
<PARA> I think people will be able to get over contracts being held or simply shuffled along a bit in a free market a lot more easily than they would be able to get over a discrete drop. We all know that people will try to weasel out of their contracts, but I think the trade should understand that this industry was facing bankruptcy whichever way we went, and that was not in its long term interests. There should be a big attempt made to hold on to those contracts and to stretch them out. It is quite possible to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) said that I should put in an administrator, and replace the Wool Corporation or free it from the Wool Council of Australia. Again I simply say I would not have the legal power to do all of those things even if I wanted to. I need to preserve the institutions and the structure, and the reserve price scheme is the centrepiece of the institutions. We would create absolute chaos if we did not go for a two-staged approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) says that the industry has been starved of information. I really do not know what the situation is. Some people think that there is too much information around. All the time I hear of people who do not even know the name of the Chairman of the Wool Corporation. The honourable member for Parkes said that the trend price should be about 580c. I have been assuming that it is about 650c. We could have an academic debate about that. The reality is that 650c, and certainly 700c, is not a market clearing price, and we would still have to go into debt if we took the price down to even 650c or 500c. I could comment on a lot of other things. I think I have already covered the points of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just finish with a comment on the private treaty merchants. The legislation is written so that the supplementary payments will be available to wool producers. Section 140 mentions supplementary payments to wool producers. These payments will be available whether the wool is sold through the auction system or through the private treaty system. There should be no disadvantage to the private treaty merchants vis-a-vis the brokers. There will be a necessity for a test certificate and a few other regulatory items. This has already been discussed by the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that we will be able to get around the private treaty merchant problem, except for where wool has been bought before the sales were deferred. We are still working on guidelines in consultation with the private treaty merchants and other elements in the industry. Unless we have every `i' dotted and every `t' crossed, I do not think there is much sense in me speculating about how we are working through those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not intend to take anything like the time allocated-just two or three minutes-because a great deal has been said in this debate about the tragic situation now confronting the wool farming industry and I do not intend to mention those details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last Saturday I was at the Oberon district show and was able to speak to many farmers, all of whom spoke gloomily about the crisis. Many of them were going home this week to engage in slaughtering activities in regard to some of their own flock. I want to assure them that I will be doing all I can to ease the burden that many of them and their families will face. I want to take a totally different line for just two minutes and give to them a poem that came into my hands some time ago called `Optimism'. As I have said, there has been a lot of gloom and doom spoken about this crisis, but I want to put this poem called `Optimism' on the record and over the airwaves to give a bit of encouragement to those farmers and their families- their wives, children and grandparents -who are facing great problems. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Two frogs fell into a deep cream bowl,</PARA>
<PARA>One was an optimistic soul;</PARA>
<PARA>But the other took a gloomy view,</PARA>
<PARA>`We shall drown,' he cried without more ado. </PARA>
<PARA>So with a last despairing cry,</PARA>
<PARA>He flung up his legs, and he said `Goodbye!'</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the problems he was confronted with were so severe that he thought that as he was going to drown he might as well drown straight away. So he did. The poem continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Said the other frog with a merry grin,</PARA>
<PARA>`I can't get out, but I won't give in,</PARA>
<PARA>I'll just swim around till my strength is spent,</PARA>
<PARA>Then will I die the more content'. </PARA>
<PARA>Bravely he swam till it would seem</PARA>
<PARA>His struggles began to churn the cream!</PARA>
<PARA>On top of the butter at last he stopped,</PARA>
<PARA>And out of the bowl he gaily hopped!</PARA>
<PARA>What is the moral? This is easily found:</PARA>
<PARA>If you can't hop out, keep swimming around!</PARA>
<PARA>That illustrates one of the things we ought to be concentrating on from this point onwards. I pray that we as a nation and as individuals will from this point take ourselves by the scruff of the neck and the seat of the pants and, rather than dwell on all the negative criticisms that we have heard today, determine to do something positive to help our farmers through this crisis. I pray that we spread the word about how important it is for us, the people who have, and the farmers who are able to make ends meet in the communities to look for the farmers who are having difficulties. All of us should come to the aid of our farming commun-ity right now and help as much as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to mention the final speech of Sir Winston Churchill when he was speaking to his old school. It was probably the occasion of the final testimonial that was given to him. In response he staggered up with his walking stick and said to the great gathering of staff and boys, `Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will also be very short because most of the things I intended to say have been said. This is a very sad day for the Australian wool industry and the thousands of individual producers and the communities that depend on them. The failure of the reserve price scheme was not the result of its concept-a concept to give growers a role in the marketing of their own product, to provide some form of equity between growers and to provide stability in the processing and textile industries. The failure is by now well documented: a set of circumstances that even in hindsight many of us would have had difficulty in avoiding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general economic downturn, particularly the withdrawal of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and China from the market, effectively removed 19 per cent of that market. The impact of the Gulf war was the final act in the disastrous world economic scene. The mismanagement of our domestic economy by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) saw our export industries incur a domestic cost structure of record high sustained interest rates and high inflation for the second time in the last eight years. I make the point that most of the problems in Australian industry-whether they be in primary or secondary industry-have had their inception in the interest rate regime. It is a tragedy to read today that in the primary sector farm incomes are expected to drop some 70 per cent. As I have said, this is the second time in about eight years that we have had to face this disastrous situation-a situation that in 1983-84 saw a massive exodus of people from the land, particularly our highly skilled and highly educated young people. This devastated our rural communities and is still causing them enormous stress. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that we are seeing tonight the beginning of the destruction of a culture of farming in this country. We are talking about wool, but over the last few weeks in this Parliament we have talked about the citrus industry, the wheat industry and the manufacturing industry-and on Thursday night we will be discussing a dried fruits Bill. The dried fruits industry is very important to my electorate and I believe that piece of legislation will move that industry slightly towards the trend we have been discussing tonight, where we will see 100 years of the operation of a very efficient industry under very difficult circumstances disadvantaged by legislation that will upset a very disciplined and highly controlled marketing system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy in retrospect to establish blame or point to our errors of administration. Such an exercise serves little purpose except as a lesson for the future-and most of us know that the only value of a study of history is so we can make the same mistakes again. But a review of the past few months raises a number of issues which are worthy of reflection. I put them very briefly on the record. In 1987 the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) decided to remove legislative checks and balances from the operation of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and reduce his own level of direct responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The raising of the floor price to 870c gave it a market-setting function rather than a support mechanism. As I have already mentioned, we have seen an unprecedented set of factors in eastern Europe, the USSR and China. The floor price was reduced from 870c to 700c, despite the Minister's promise not to lower it for two years, and, understandably, breaking that promise failed to restore market confidence and in fact promoted further speculation. The activities of the Vines committee have been mentioned, as has been the suspension of sales by the AWC which, in itself, provided a clear indication that the Corporation was bankrupt and could not continue buying in. Finally, of course, there was the realisation that the proposed increased levies and quotas would not be sustainable and would create inequities between growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the last few months the coalition has fully backed the floor price, recognising that continued public comment would only exacerbate the situation and that ultimately the AWC and the Government had the legislative and administrative responsibilities. I am concerned that the announced changes which we are seeing here will leave growers without any clear outlook for the future and will leave the trade in limbo after the existing selling season. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks at this point, but obviously we are discussing important legislation tonight and over the next few weeks members of this Parliament will be trying to restore confidence in Australia's wool industry as quickly as possible. Confidence today will be the key to the industry's future and I believe that the coalition's amendments, which will be moved shortly by my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), will allow wool sales to commence next week with as much certainty about the future as is possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), I will not take up much time. I probably have as much time as the wool industry has at the moment. The wool industry does not want platitudes; it wants a few answers. I suppose that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will be judged in due course, and he knows that as well as I do. The Minister says that he believes that the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill is terribly important, and it is not for me to judge whether he thinks that is right and whether he is genuine in that belief. He will be judged at some later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at how important this matter is to the other side. Let us run through the members of the Australian Labor Party who have spoken on this-to quote the Minister-`terribly important issue'. I refer to the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who I doubt has ever seen a sheep, and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who I am sure has seen lots of them. That is the extent of the terrible concern over the state of the wool industry that we have seen from the Labor side of the House. That will be reflected further down when the ultimate judgment is made on how this Government has handled the wool industry. Labor members will be judged in due course and will be judged very harshly. </PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time this afternoon a question was asked by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) as to what happened with the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing prior to Christmas and whether there had been discussions about a possible 500c reserve price. If I am incorrect no doubt the Minister will correct me, but my clear recollection of what happened this afternoon was that the Minister did not deny that that may have happened. But a short time ago he said that there had been a denial. Somebody has been on the telephone, having realised the precarious position in which that answer left the Government as to what the Vines committee potentially would do to this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that he had only a week in which to act. If he had been told what the Vines committee was saying, he would have had plenty of time to act on this legislation. The reality is that what has been proposed by the Government will destroy the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), there is no doubt about that. It will not be able to service this massive debt. What the industry is looking for and what it is now getting is some leadership. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has put up a proposal that will save the AWC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie says, the AWC will be the long term saviour of the wool industry. It knows very well that it has made significant mistakes over the past 10 months, and I am not here to cover up for it. It well knows that it should have given the woolgrowers a far better insight into what was happening. We told them, and the Deputy Leader of the National Party said that the Wool Corporation was not telling the growers. But that is now history, and let us get on with some answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, the cap that is proposed by the Opposition is a sensible approach. I gather that many woolgrowers have been listening to this debate. I assure them that we are supporting the figure of $300m. I have had 10 phone calls tonight and only one caller out of 10 realised that we were supporting that, and an extra $200m extension of borrowing. I hope the message is now clear that that is what we are supporting. It will put some people who will be selling between now and the end of June in a difficult position. That gives me no joy, and it will give no joy to the Deputy Leader of the National Party or to the Minister, but it is a fact of life, regrettably, that that will happen.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of ways in which this matter can be approached. An interim payment initially after sale, with a final dividend, is one way to approach the matter. Obviously it must be worked out in the very near future. That would appear to me to be a sensible approach. We must get this industry back on its feet again. We must stop what has happened overseas in the last 12 months. There is total loss of confidence in the industry and I know that the Minister agrees. We must start restoring that confidence. Regrettably, the reserve price scheme is finished, let no-one have any doubt about that. Therefore, we must pick up the pieces and approach this on a sensible, rational basis. The Government's proposal will destroy the AWC because the AWC will not be able to support this debt. The coalition's proposals will save the AWC and the industry and in due course we will get recognition for the amount of work that has been done, for the input of the coalition and the fact that we have got the answers to this very serious national problem. It is not a country problem or a rural problem. It is a national problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise one or two issues at the close of this debate. It is typical of this Government to raise expectations and then fail to deliver. We have again seen this done in this area. Only a few months ago we had an iron clad guarantee that we would have a floor price for two years. I think everybody can remember the iron clad guarantee given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that the wool industry could be certain of its future. The floor price was set at 700c. Off the Minister went around the world to tell many of our wool buyers that that was the case. But like in so many other areas, this Government raises expectations but does not deliver. So it was the case with the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a sad reflection on this Government that we can think back to so many instances of its failure to deliver, whether it be child poverty or capital gains. The same can be said about this year's Budget surplus which was going to be $8 billion; we are now told it will be less than $4 billion; and it will probably be down to zero. The Government raises expectations but it cannot deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pick up on what the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) was saying. This Government's attitude to the rural sector in Australia is typified by this debate. Only four government members have come into this House to debate and show any concern for what the Minister says is a vital industry for this country. Only four members of the Government have been prepared to come in to the House and debate this issue. That tells the Australian public how much the Australian Labor Party is really concerned about people in rural towns and cities, about our balance of trade problems and about a vital industry. Quite frankly, the Government is not very concerned at all, otherwise Government members would be in this House debating this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> From listening to this debate, it becomes quite clear that most people are talking about uncertainties. But one thing is certain about this debate-and that is that rural Australia faces a crisis which will flow through and affect most other people in the community. It is a great tragedy that such an important industry has got into this state. This problem has arisen under a Labor Government; not under a coalition government. People in the wool industry ought to remember that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Clause 4, page 2, line 23, proposed subsection 141 (2), omit ``(whatever the source of that money)'', substitute ``(whatever the source of that money, but amounts payable from so much of that money as is attributable to payments to the Corporation under paragraphs 47 (1) (a) and (d) are not to exceed in the aggregate $200,000,000)''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Clause 4, page 3, lines 21 to 24, omit proposed section 146, substitute the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> Disposing of wool stocks</PARA>
<PARA> `` `146. While guidelines are in force under section 144:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for a period of 12 months beginning on the commencement of this Part, the Corporation must not sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products except in very limited circumstances as prescribed by regulation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in any period after that described in paragraph (a), the Corporation shall only sell, charge or otherwise dispose of its stocks of wool or wool products in a publicised, orderly and predictable manner, as prescribed in a subsequent enactment.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Clause 4, page 4, line 36, omit proposed paragraph 148 (2) (b). </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for moving the first amendment relates to the supplementary payments scheme. I want to make it very clear again that we support that scheme in principle, and we support the Government's contribution of $300m to that scheme. Our concern is that there is no limit on what the wool growers themselves may be required to pay for that scheme. Guesstimates of up to $700m and beyond have been made of the amount that would be added to the already great debt of $2.9 billion confronting wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at a potential debt to growers of over $3.5 billion, and an annual interest payment of about $600m. That could mean that 20 per cent of wool growers' income, already dramatically reduced, could be required to meet those interest payments. That is just not a viable situation for wool growers. It is not, and I believe the Minister knows that. There will be an annual brawl between the industry and the government of the day as to who should pay that interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In a genuine, constructive desire to limit that debt this amendment has been moved to put a cap of $500m on the total scheme. There has been some criticism by the Wool Council of Australia that we are not providing, by this amendment, reasonable equity to those 35 to 40 per cent of growers who are still to sell their wool this year. That is not the intention at all. In fact, the Government, through the guidelines that it is releasing for the supplementary payments scheme, will itself be attempting to limit the cost of that scheme by a different method-a very messy and complicated method-which will also mean that growers will not be receiving the full equity at the 700c level. </PARA>
<PARA> The method we are suggesting is very clean and open. More importantly, it sends a signal to growers to apply some discipline themselves in providing their own reserves so that their wool is not given away followed by a blow-out in cost. Hopefully, it sends signal to buyers as well that they will not be able to pick up wool almost at no cost, that a market is established and that there is a recognition of the greater problem to the wool growers. That greater problem, beyond the immediate problem of reasonable equity to growers who are still to sell their wool this season, is that massive debt which is there, and will be there for some years while the stockpile remains. That is the reason for that amendment. I believe, and the coalition believes, that it is possible, through a reasonable market operation with those disciplines in place, to provide equity with that $500m cap. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment concerns the disposal of wool stocks. Honourable members will note that in that amendment we are requiring that the procedures for the management of the stockpile be as much as possible by legislation rather than by regulation, and that they be for a period of 12 months beginning at the commencement of the sales hopefully next week. </PARA>
<PARA> A complete understanding of stockpile management is an important part of restoring confidence in the industry and providing a market for it. The size of the stockpile overhangs the market and threatens a reasonable price for potential buyers, especially if there is any uncertainty on the management of the stockpile. That is what our amendment is about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister indicated that later this week he will issue guidelines for the management of the stockpile until the end of June. Why can he not enshrine those guidelines in legislation for a period of 12 months? The Minister has foreshadowed further announcements beyond the end of June. However, those buyers who will return to that market when it reopens will be looking not only at the situation between now and the end of June but also beyond the end of June. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWC must perform a delicate balancing act: on the one hand it must ensure a clearance of what is still an excessive production of wool in this country unless there are new market opportunities with the free market and, on the other hand, the Corporation will have to reduce that stockpile in an orderly way so that the wool growers' massive debt is reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially it is important to establish confidence and security in the new market. To do that there should be a freeze on the stockpile for 12 months with limited provision for sales to certain categories for either contractual purposes or special requirements. Beyond that 12-month period further legislation will be required so there is clear security and confidence in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Our final amendment concerns the regulation making power of the Minister. The Minister has conceded that the legislation is hastily drafted. The Minister already has the usual regulatory powers in section 148, which are the standard powers given to him in this type of legislation. In addition, the Minister wants special power to amend `any provisions of this Act other than this part'. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment seeks to delete that particular clause because it makes a mockery of the legislation. It basically gives the Minister power by regulation to overrule any other part of the legislation. The Minister says he needs that power because penalties may have to be provided for those who abuse the scheme. If that is the case, let us have that provision in the legislation. If the Minister believes he needs something then let us have it up front in the legislation, as I said when dealing with the stockpile. The Committee should not just give the Minister these powers to act as he likes. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend those three constructive amendments to the Committee. We believe that they will improve the overall operation of the Bill to the benefit of wool growers at this very difficult time. I foreshadow a division on this matter to demonstrate our feelings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government shares the Opposition's motive but not its support for these amendments. The motive is how to get the maximum amount of money for growers in the free market between now and 30 June by encouraging people to put on a reserve rather than just taking any price. The problem that both the Government and the Opposition face is that we are dealing with, and making estimates on, some sort of static situation. The reality is that we cannot guess the free market price or how much wool will be sold in the months and years ahead. The equation is a net return from the status quo balanced up against the rest of this year to get intraseasonal equity versus the net returns of the free market to 30 June. After 30 June, the situation will be different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a limit to what can be put into legislation if the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) is to be a flexible commercial organisation. I do not know what amendments, if any, will come back from the Senate but we are really dealing with a situation where, as I said, there is not an enormous amount that we should be putting inflexibly into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> By and large, I believe that far from helping wool growers, these amendments put the effects of the suspension right back on those growers who happen to be selling between now and the end of June because those growers would not get supplementary benefits under this proposal until July, at the earliest. They would get a lesser payment than currently proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> A great number of back of the envelope costings for this scheme have been getting a lot of currency lately. A proper costing takes account of the types of wool coming forward until June, the likely market response to those types, the provisions of the wool tax legislation, tax receipts and cash flows-the type of complications that really do not get taken into account on the back of an envelope. When these complications get taken into account, the picture is quite a bit different. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular amendment is put up in order to respond to some of those back of the envelope calculations. We do estimate, after careful work, that the cost of supplementing growers receiving a 375c floor price equivalent is $677m. That amount is estimated to cover the difference between what the grower is paid and what he would receive in hand under a reserve price of 700c. This amendment would only allow supplementation above a 527c floor price. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment achieves nothing but disruption. It means either less money for the growers, a higher levy, other legislation or more money from the Government. I really think that it is very difficult and hopefully, before this is run in the Senate, I may be able to convince the Opposition of this. </PARA>
<PARA> On the guidelines for the stockpile management, the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), is now aware that the arrangements for handling the stockpile between now and 30 June have been announced this evening. I am quite sure that he, like me, will want further clarification; but at this stage they are suitably clear and straightforward and the guidelines will be gazetted on Friday next, assuming that we continue to have the Opposition's kind cooperation in passing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already announced that the guidelines to apply next year will be announced as part of the Government's response to the report of the Vines committee of inquiry into wool marketing and as part of the package of measures dealing with the AWC's debt position. Again, I understand the Opposition's desire to have these guidelines to allow for an orderly, public and predictable disposal of the stockpile; however, too much order and predictability would allow the AWC's position to be speculated against, and the complex task of drawing up the guidelines will be done after proper investigation of the stockholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Opposition's third amendment, this subsection allows for regulations to amend the Act. I accept that this sort of thing is usually regarded as bad law. This provision is temporary and ceases to exist on the proclamation of the cessation of the supplementary payments scheme and the cessation or suspension of the minimum reserve price. I do acknowledge that it is an unusual form of drafting. However, I am advised that it is perfectly constitutional and lawful. It would only be used after careful consideration and, if it is of any value to the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, I hereby undertake to consult him on its use should I ever contemplate using it. The maximum penalty under this Bill is $2,000. We may need to move if we find some anomaly or something that has not been anticipated in this very new situation. As I said at the outset, I accept the Opposition's motives, but the Government cannot accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Does the prescribed minimum value per head of sheep, used for valuing natural increase and calculating taxable income, create a taxable income for the producer which will never be realised.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will he reduce the prescribed minimum value per head of sheep from $4 to a level which would reflect current market conditions.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="948" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MARANOA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Taxpayers owning livestock may adopt either of two methods of valuing livestock: cost price or market selling value. Under the cost price method, livestock is valued at the cost incurred in purchasing or producing the livestock. In the case of livestock created by natural increase, it is recognised that there are difficulties in determining the appropriate cost price. For this reason, minimum values are prescribed as an estimate of the cost of natural increase. It is important to note that these values do not relate to the market selling value of the livestock.</PARA>
<PARA> If a taxpayer using the cost price method of valuation sells livestock at a price lower than cost price, then the taxpayer will incur a loss in the year of sale which will be deductible for tax purposes. Where a taxpayer has chosen to use the cost price method of valuing livestock, this is an appropriate outcome. It is also worth noting that where a taxpayer using the cost price method sells livestock at a profit, then that profit will not be recognised until the year of sale. This is a recognised feature of the cost price method of valuation; it defers the recognition of both gains and losses in the value of livestock until sale. If taxpayers wish to gain immediate recognition of losses on production, then they can use the market selling value method of valuing livestock. This method, of course, also immediately recognises gains.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A change in market conditions does not necessarily mean that the cost of production of natural increase of sheep has fallen. There is therefore no basis to change the minimum prescribed values.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover taxpayers can elect to bring the natural increase of livestock to account at the actual cost of production if this is less than the prescribed minimum value for that class of livestock. This should alleviate the problems faced by any taxpayer whose cost of production of natural increase is lower than the prescribed minimum value.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 4 December 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the Auditor-General's report on his Department's AIDS grants which reveals serious breaches of Government guidelines and funding management deficiencies including payments being made before approved commencement dates, payments being made without conditions being met, inadequate monitoring of funded projects and shortcomings in reporting and acquittal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What sum did the breaches referred to in part (1) cost.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) What action will be taken (a) against those persons responsible for the breaches and (b) to prevent these breaches happening in the future.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="948" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LOWE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the Auditor-General's report. Criticisms in the report relate to funds management aspects of some of the 1988-89 Community Education Grants and Commonwealth AIDS Research Grants (CARG) and Commonwealth AIDS Prevention and Education Grants (CAPE). Funds provided for these grants represent approximately 13% of the Department's total program outlays in the fight against AIDS of $42 million and $61 million in 1988-89 and 1989-90 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Following standard audit practice, a sample of the above grants to the value of $3.1 million were examined. Deficiencies where a cost to the Commonwealth were identified related to early payments of some grants representing a cost to the Commonwealth in forgone interest. The Auditor-General's report does not identify which grants were paid early and it is therefore not possible to identify the size of the potential cost to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) As there was no suggestion of wrong-doing on the part of persons administering these programs, no action has been taken against those persons. It should be noted that administration of these grants involves dealing with community groups, individuals and organisations who do not always have the required skills or understanding to comply with strict `legal' Government guidelines and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Audit Office was advised prior to commencement of the audit that computerised monitoring systems were being implemented to rectify problems identified by departmental officers. This was noted in the Auditor-General's report. These systems are now operational and monitor all aspects of grants administration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr Staples</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, a number of steps were taken to ensure that people from non-English speaking backgrounds were informed about the recent changes to the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA> Two print advertisements were produced in fifteen community languages and placed extensively in the ethnic press informing the community about the changes introduced on 1 November 1990. Several ethnic newspapers also featured the story in unpaid articles and editorials.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the press campaign, seven of the English language radio advertisements explaining the 1 November changes were adapted for use on ethnic and Aboriginal radio throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A range of educational materials were produced to inform the community about the new minimum pricing policy which was introduced on 1 December 1990. Strategic press advertising was used in support of this activity, including the placement of two advertisements in the ethnic press.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Neither I nor the Department of Community Services and Health are aware of any activity of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Two pamphlets explaining the new minimum pricing policy to pensioners and the general community were produced in English and ten community languages. Umbrella groups representing non-English speaking people, together with medical practitioners, pharmacists, nursing homes, hostels, and Members of Parliament, have been informed that copies are available on request.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is currently working on the production of a general brochure that will outline the features of the new PBS, including the minimum pricing policy and revised safety net arrangements. Once this brochure has been produced in English it will be translated into a number of community languages and widely distributed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Tambo was given Government assistance under the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Special Visits Program during his visit to Australia in 1987. The Government's program for visitors from South Africa is designed to provide an alternative to the South African Government's information activities in Australia by giving those not represented by that Government an opportunity to put their views to the Australian public. The Government has never opposed a private visit to Australia by Chief Buthelezi, but his involvement in the existing political structures in South Africa has meant that a visit by him under the Special Visits Program would have been inappropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale for the Australian System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP) is to assist developing countries compete against the products of developed countries on the Australian market. The current ASTP came into effect on 1 July 1986 following a comprehensive review of the former scheme. In undertaking the review, the Government was conscious of the effect of developing country preference margins on Australian industry. It also took into account the concerns of developing countries in relation to predictability and coverage of preferences under the arrangements then in place.</PARA>
<PARA> As a carefully balanced compromise, the current scheme provides universal product coverage, a uniform five percentage point preference margin and no product or country exclusion provisions. Some 130 developing countries are eligible to participate in the scheme. Singapore is still recognised internationally as a developing country.</PARA>
