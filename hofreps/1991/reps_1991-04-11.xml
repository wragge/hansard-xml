<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>1. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children</PARA>
<PARA>(b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements.</PARA>
<PARA>2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble.</PARA>
<PARA>3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children.</PARA>

<PARA>1. By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament.</PARA>

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. THAT ratification of UN Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. THAT the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. THAT the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA>4. THAT Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. THAT some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loop-holes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. THAT some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention.</PARA>

<TITLE>Citizen Directed Taxation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that:</PARA>
<PARA>a) recent public opinion surveys indicate that the Australian electorate is losing faith in the Federal Government as an effective forum for the representation of the views and interests of the wider community despite the hard work and dedicated efforts of Members and Senators;</PARA>
<PARA>b) that it is of vital importance for specific measures to be taken to restore public confidence in the institutions of Government;</PARA>
<PARA>c) that recent social and technological changes, including improved education, and efficient media communications, have resulted in a significant enhancement of the ability of ordinary citizens to judge and participate in political processes; and</PARA>
<PARA>d) that faith in government would be most effectively enhanced if ordinary citizens accept an enhanced decision-making role in public decision-making; and</PARA>
<PARA>e) that ideally, ordinary citizens should play a direct role in determining how public funds are allocated.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the House to legislate for the introduction of Citizen Directed Taxation so that:</PARA>
<PARA>a) all citizens of Australia can lawfully exercise their right to determine how a proportion of their taxes are spent;</PARA>
<PARA>b) in the first year of the introduction of Citizen Directed Taxation, 5 per centum of total taxation revenues will be subject to Citizen Direction and that each year thereafter an additional 5 per centum of revenues will be added to the CDT pool, until, after ten years, 50 per centum of all government revenues shall be subject to Citizen Direction;</PARA>
<PARA>c) the Parliament retains responsibility for determining the allocation of the balance of tax revenues; and</PARA>
<PARA>d) executive responsibility for administration of government expenditure will remain with Ministers and senior public servants.</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows</PARA>
<PARA> Their opposition to the dispatch of three Australian warships to the Middle East, which is part of an unnecessary militarisation of the region, and which contributes to the likelihood of all-out war. The increasing military buildup in the Middle East does not contribute to a resolution of the conflict. The conflict can only be resolved by regionally based diplomatic means. Whilst we unambiguously oppose the acquisition of territory by force and Iraq's military takeover of Kuwait, we note that current actions against Iraq have not been applied in similar circumstances, such as the annexation of East Timor by Indonesia.</PARA>

Particularly now with the rural downturn, we cannot keep passing our costs onto the grazier so consideration by the government is needed in cutting the fuel costs for the livestock carriers perhaps by an across the board deduction in our fuel tax, and sales tax on all we buy for the business is what we feel is needed to get us all economically sound again.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading misrepresentations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the Committee's report entitled The Injured Coastline: Protection of the Coastal Environment, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZH4">Ms McHUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee commenced its inquiry into the protection of the coastal environment in June 1989 under the previous Chairman, Mr Peter Milton. In the course of the inquiry the Committee discovered that there is a great deal of disillusionment, dissatisfaction and scepticism amongst concerned sections of the community towards public inquiries into the coast. The apparent failure of public authorities, particularly the Commonwealth Government, to act upon the recommendations of the numerous other reviews has contributed to this widespread disillusionment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As long ago as 1970 the report of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution observed that the discharge of sewage and industrial wastes into the sea and coastal waterways was the major cause of water pollution in Australia. In 1980 the predecessor to our Committee, that is, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, recommended that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the States, develop and promulgate national policies and objectives for the conservation and preservation of the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of the coastline are well known and have been for 20 years. It is not surprising that large sections of the community are completely disillusioned with public inquiries about the coastal zone because, unfortunately, there has been little subsequent positive action by governments at all levels to act on the observations and recommendations of such inquiries. Indeed, one participant at a public meeting in Byron Bay earlier this year criticised our Committee's inquiry as just an example of the Commonwealth being seen to be doing something but actually doing nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee believes it is now time for the Commonwealth to take the initiative in providing a coordinated framework for coastal management in Australia before the existing problems get worse. There is a desperate need to develop a coordinated national coastal policy. The national Government should take the lead because the problems exist nationwide. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth should, without delay, develop a national coastal zone management strategy in cooperation with the States, Territories and local governments to provide a framework for the coordination of coastal management throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As constitutional responsibility for the coastline lies primarily with the States, the Committee sees that the appropriate role of the Commonwealth in the coastal zone is to provide national policy guidance and practical support to the other levels of government. The Committee considers that responsibility for managing the coastline must remain with the States. We recommend that the Commonwealth should provide financial assistance to State and local government as part of a national strategy. However, such funding would be based upon the other two levels of government meeting certain performance criteria and participating in a national policy formulation process. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not think it is necessary to establish a new special purpose Federal agency, despite proposing that the Commonwealth take the initiative. The Committee strongly supports the proposed establishment of a Commonwealth environment protection agency (EPA), which the Committee recommends should be the Federal body responsible for administering the national aspects of the coastal strategy. We also think that the National Working Group on Coastal Management announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement on the environment in July 1989 should have responsibility for developing the strategy. However, it must have broad representation of interested parties, including local government and the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> Following agreement with the States and local governments on the development of this strategy, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth should further consult with other levels of government in formulating a coastal zone management Act, establishing in legislation the Commonwealth interest in the coast. The Committee considers that the relevant United States legislation is a very useful model here, since under that legislation management responsibility remains with the States and the important role of local government in coastal management is acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> We were advised that the Australian- New Zealand Environment Council (ANZEC) has, since 1989, been preparing national water quality guidelines in cooperation with the States and Territories. We recommend that these water quality guidelines be prepared as quickly as possible. We also recommend that ANZEC should develop national standards for waste discharges from all types of industry based on the use of pollution equipment utilising at first the criterion of best available technology economically available. We envisage that the proposed Federal EPA would monitor the effectiveness of these standards and monitor improvements in pollution control technology. Then standards should be improved, with the ultimate national objective being the attainment of a nationally consistent standard based on the best available technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we recommend that such national environmental guidelines and standards that have been agreed upon by the States and the Commonwealth should be incorporated in the proposed Commonwealth coastal management Act. I stress, however, that the Commonwealth should be seeking a coordinated national policy which includes pollution control standards. The States should retain responsibility for actually policing those standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, Bondi is in my electorate so I cannot resist talking about the condition of Sydney's beaches. What I have to stress, and have been stressing all around the country, is that the problem of beach pollution is not limited to Sydney alone. It is simply, as I always say, that because Bondi is the best and most beautiful of all those beaches it remains a national symbol of how we, as Australians, have treated the ocean and rivers as a cheap sink to dispose of our rubbish and waste. This attitude is gradually changing-the tide is turning. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is particularly concerned about the few alternatives currently available to the disposal of sewage into the ocean and the possible bio-accumulation of toxic substances in marine fauna. We note that the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) has observed in a recent report that 80 per cent of environment research funds are allocated or spent within Federal agencies. ASTEC has also suggested that the Commonwealth identify priority areas for environmental research when providing research funding. We recommend that some of the existing environmental research funding should be specifically directed to the research and development of new waste water treatment technologies as an alternative to ocean disposal. Furthermore, adequate funding should also be provided to existing research programs on the likely impacts of the bio-accumulation of toxic substances in the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA> What distinguished this Committee's recommendations from those of previous inquiries is that we are recommending specific actions, most of which are within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction and which can be undertaken now. Others, such as pollution standards promulgated federally, should be arrived at after wide consultation with the States and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of this report must not be lost in the policy vacuum that apparently surrounds government actions about the coastal environment. The coast is unquestionably a very special place for Australians. It is an area of intense economic and social activity, and it is beset by enormous problems that my colleagues in this debate, now and next week, I hope, will take up. The problems have been known for years. </PARA>
<PARA> This report provides a guide for the development of Commonwealth policy for the coastal zone. Unfortunately at present the Commonwealth's activities in the coastal zone are ad hoc, uncoordinated and lacking in focus. The report is about redressing this lack of focus and overcoming the present, ad hoc governmental responses to coastal problems. The big difference between our report and all those that have gone before is that public demand will insist that our recommendations be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has placed its consideration of the problems of the coastal environment within the wider context of the current debate on sustainable development. Most, if not all, of the problems evidenced in the coastal zone are reflected in the growing realisation that economic growth and development are dependent upon the effective management of natural resources and the maintenance of ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the concept of sustainable development will provide a challenge to existing disciplines of knowledge, methods of analysis and attitudes to renewable and non-renewable use of resources. The Australian Science and Technology Council, in its most recent report, observed that multidisciplinary research and approaches must be developed to meet the need for a holistic view of the environment. Our Committee believes that there is certainly a need to develop a holistic approach to the coastal zone. Existing approaches to coastal management have too frequently been shown to be limited in perspective. There is a challenge for the future as we develop and expand the concepts of resource management and environmental science. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I express my thanks and the Committee's thanks to the many people who contributed to the inquiry by writing submissions and comments on the Committee's discussion paper, by attending the many public hearings or accompanying us during inspections. We met marvellous people in the crowded cities along the coast and in the remote Aboriginal communities in north-west Australia. The problems, or the potential problems, are the same everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my sincere thanks to the secretariat, particularly Mr David Crawford. Without the excellent work of that secretariat during a prolonged period the Committee would not have been able to produce a report with recommendations as potentially effective and as irresistible, I hope, to government of any colour as the recommendations that we have produced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The well-known definition of parliament is that it is a place where somebody gets up to speak, says nothing, nobody listens and then everybody disagrees. This morning we have heard the very reverse of that. The Chairperson of this very fine, upstanding committee-the House of Representative Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-has presented a most cohesive, succinct report and summary of the recommendations following the tabling of this very important report on the protection of the coastline of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Chairperson, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), spoke of the excellent work that was undertaken by members of the secretariat who were responsible for the support effort in producing this report. I would like to begin by expressing again on behalf of the Committee, because I think it can be stated many times, our deep appreciation for the effort put in by Mr David Crawford, who kept us on the mark and arranged a very interesting itinerary that took us everywhere. I almost feel like singing the song, `I've been everywhere', because we have been up to the north-west tip of the continent, the north-east tip, the south-west, and the south-east. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the highlights of the expedition which was undertaken by members of the Committee, which I missed, was the trip to Tasmania. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) is here. My belief is that in missing out on going to Tasmania and viewing the difficulties and problems there, I missed out on probably the best trip. </PARA>

<PARA> Thanks must go also to Lindy Smith, the secretary of the Committee, who very capably oversaw the whole exercise. We thank Tracy Cumberland for the excellent work that she engaged in. She made the undertaking of this inquiry a pleasant experience, and I am sure that I would have that echoed by all members of the Committee. I would just like to thank too members of the Committee for their dedication. I have been on this Committee now for six or seven years and the present Committee is one that is truly dedicated to the task at hand. The attendance at the various inquiries and private discussions was, I believe, well above average as far as my understanding of committees is concerned. I would like to express that appreciation to the members of the Committee for the very fine effort that they put into the making of this monumental report, which has been very well summarised and presented to us here by the Chairperson, the honourable member for Phillip. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations have been well covered by the Chairperson of the Committee. In making her speech, she mentioned the fact that the first committee that made any inquiries into the difficulties and problems that pertain to the environment in Australia, particularly the coast, was undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution in 1970. I was interested to read that in terms of history and settlement, Australia is quite a new country. I was interested to read also that the United Kingdom established its first Department of the Environment with the Secretary of State as head only in 1970. The whole concept of environmental studies and concern for the environment, therefore, has been quite recent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee made this statement, which was summarised in the back of our report:</PARA>
<PARA>water pollution . . . is potentially one of the gravest problems facing this nation and it has wide biological, social and industrial implications . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, although it is 20 years since that report was presented, there is still a need to emphasise and restate those concerns and that very important observation. </PARA>
<PARA> Words like ecology, habitat, conservation and pollution, which came up frequently in our discussions and public hearings, have not long been part of the everyday vocabulary of people in this country and, indeed, around the world. There are very clear reasons for our modern concern for the environment, and in our case, particularly with regard to this report, the protection of the Australian coast. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason, perhaps, is the fact that it is only in the last 200 years that we have seen an almost zero population growth in this land, that is excluding the indigenous people who are here, to 17 million plus, and that has occurred in many ways in an unplanned fashion. A lot of the problems and difficulties that we are being confronted with now, and which this Committee very obviously noticed in its travels and during the public hearings where it heard this information, were caused because we made many grave errors and there has been a lot of carelessness with regard to our care for the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why we have this before us in a very real way concerns what was brought to the world's attention by the so-called Club of Rome in 1972. It pointed out how finite the earth's resources are, not the least being the waterways, the oceans and so on that we are concerned with in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that has made the recommendations and so on in this report so much more important are the areas of runaway technology that came out again and again when we were considering the various submissions and listening to the expertise of people as they presented their reports to us in the public hearings. There is great concern about pesticides, herbicides, various wastes, chemicals and otherwise. Urban run-off is a major problem in terms of the pollution of rivers. Eventually, of course, this pollution gets into the sea. At almost every public hearing the question of urban run-off was brought to the notice of the Committee in a very real way, and we believe that is one question that should be considered by the Government, and indeed by the Parliament, as it considers the recommendations that we have brought before the Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested this morning to hear the Speaker's prayer and the petition regarding that prayer. The question that arose in my mind was: to whom does the earth belong? I recall the words of the psalmist in Psalm 24:1 where it clearly says that the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it. It points out the very important fact that we all need to take very careful note of-that we are really only tenants here. Therefore, our possession of this land is leasehold; it is not freehold. It is very important that we remember that, particularly with regard to what we hope and plan to leave for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting parts of our trip was to Broome, which was the last informal inspection that we had. We met a chap called Paddy Roe who was the law keeper and custodian of the Broome region. I would like to conclude my remarks by reading the words of Paddy Roe, which I think complement the words of Psalm 24:1. Paddy Roe's words seem to sum up our responsibility as people in this nation-and, indeed, those throughout the world-with regard to the very grave concerns that we have raised in our report. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Country now comes from Budarri-Garri (dreamtime). It was made by all the dreamtime ancestors, who left their tracks and statues behind and gave us our law, we still follow that law, which tells us how to look after this country and how to keep it alive. </PARA>
<PARA>The true people followed this law from generation to generation until today that is why this country is still good and gives us plenty, we never take more than we need and respect each others areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Today everybody, all kind of people walk through this country, now all of us together have to respect and look after this land, when we look after it proper way, this land stays happy and it will make all of us happy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that has been tabled is the second report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in this Parliament, each being tabled on successive sitting Thursdays. It is my understanding that this is the first major review of student financial assistance undertaken by a parliamentary committee. This report will be of interest to students, parents, teachers and educationalists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry arose out of a report by the Auditor-General on the administration of Austudy. While the Auditor-General's investigations into Austudy administration were extensive, the audit did not address the question of the effectiveness of the program; our inquiry did. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearly 400,000 students receive some form of financial assistance. The estimated expenditure this financial year will be in excess of $1 billion. The 28 recommendations, if accepted by the Government, will constitute a major, radical overhaul of student financial assistance and provide a sound basis for the evaluation of the scheme. I believe the report will be well received nationally but in my own area of western Sydney it will be of profound significance. </PARA>
<PARA> How well is the money being spent? For nearly 12 months the Committee has been addressing the question of how effective this expenditure has been in improving the educational outcomes for the less advantaged in Australian society. The Committee is unable to answer the question. It received 130 submissions and took evidence from 50 witnesses. Participation rates in all educational sectors are increasing and while the contribution of student financial assistance to these trends might be important, the precise contributions of these trends is not known. </PARA>
<PARA> The retention rates in senior secondary years for students from varying socio-economic backgrounds are increasing. However, the rates of increase are the same for all groups. The evidence suggests that factors other than student financial assistance, such as prevailing labour market conditions, may have a greater influence on the decision of students to remain at school. Perhaps the most astonishing finding of the Committee is that none of the student financial assistance programs-that is, Austudy, Abstudy or the assistance for isolated children program-have ever been properly evaluated to determine their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Several fundamental issues must be addressed in any assessment of effectiveness. Firstly, does the income support actually improve educational outcomes and access? Secondly, what equity goals have been achieved and what is the effect of other changes, particularly those in the labour market? Thirdly, would the same results have been achieved without assistance or with lower levels of assistance? Fourthly, are there alternative forms of assistance? Fifthly, what is the effectiveness of income and assets tests in targeting eligible recipients? The data does not exist to respond to these points. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts that there are some difficulties in measuring the effectiveness of Austudy. What is unacceptable, however, is that apart from a few isolated surveys, no real attempt has been made to establish whether the program is meeting its stated aims. No real assessment of the effectiveness of Austudy or alternative means of student assistance can be determined without proper performance indicators. These do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to means testing. A continuing source of aggravation was the granting of Austudy to parents who were able to bear the cost of study. Eligibility for allowances for dependent students is determined by an assessment of parents' taxable income. Taxable income is an administratively simple means of assessing Austudy eligibility. It is clear from the evidence of the Australian Taxation Office and elsewhere that taxable income is a poor measure of a family's ability to meet the education expenses of their children. As a result, rorting occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxable income does not take account of any fringe benefits received and it allows for certain deductions such as negatively geared property. It is apparent also that self-employed people are able to arrange their affairs in order to minimise their taxable income. While these arrangements are not specifically designed to attract Government benefits, the end result is that they do. We have recommended that tax deductions derived from negatively geared property, superannuation and prior year losses be excluded as allowable deductions for the purposes of student financial assistance eligibility and that the value of fringe benefits be included as income. This approach has major implications for the social welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the parental income test, the parental income threshold at which allowances are reduced is too low. This year the threshold is $19,300, or 63 per cent of male average weekly earnings. For all but four years of the operation of the tertiary education assistance scheme, the predecessor of Austudy, the parental income levels were at least 80 per cent. The Committee considers that the combined parental income should be at least 75 per cent of male average weekly earnings before student allowances are affected. This is still a very low family income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the maximum incomes at which allowances cease are too high and inappropriately targeted. It makes little sense, and is a waste of taxpayers' money, to pay some families with incomes in excess of $100,000 an allowance of less than $1 a week for each of their children. An appropriate level for benefits to cease might be twice male average weekly earnings. On 1990 figures this would represent an annual income of $56,000-quite a substantial income. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to Austudy administration, in the past the service provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) could only be described as appalling. The Auditor-General commented on Austudy delivery in detail in a 282 page report containing 124 recommendations. All honourable members would know about the lost forms, lengthy delays before students were placed on payment, incorrect advice and, of course, a telephone inquiry service of a standard which resulted in over 20 per cent of callers not getting through. The Department of Employment, Education and Training told us of the many reforms which it has introduced to improve the service to students. A number of my Committee colleagues, both government and non-government, believe that DEET has been given its chance and has failed. They have argued, as have others in a number of submissions, that the program should be transferred to the Department of Social Security (DSS). </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made no critical assessment of how efficiently DSS administers its own programs but noted the comments of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs that the Department had substantial problems in its contact with its own clients. Because of the reforms introduced by DEET, the Committee supports the continuation of the administration of student financial assistance by DEET, provided that further significant reforms are undertaken, particularly those relating to the upgrading of the telephone inquiry service and continuing decentralisation. If, however, substantial improvements in the performance of DEET are not achieved, the Committee believes that the program should be transferred to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> While I cannot provide detailed data to prove that Austudy is the best means of achieving equity in education, those who wish to scrap the program and substitute some other system have less data to justify their position. Loans schemes, taxation incentives or scholarship schemes have all been tried, either here in Australia or overseas. All alternative programs have been shown to have their own particular problems. At least Austudy attempts to target those least able to afford the cost of their senior secondary or tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of all those who made submissions, assisted with inspections and gave evidence to the Committee. Student representatives and university counselling services were particularly helpful. I specifically wish to record my appreciation for the assistance given by officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The criticism of the departmental administration of Austudy is a reflection on the complexities of the program rather than a reflection on the competence of departmental staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is the first parliamentary committee report where cartoons were specifically commissioned. This Committee believes that one of its most important roles is adding to public knowledge. I am sure that this innovation will have assisted in the task. Our thanks go to Socrates of Grafis Art and Design Studio, who prepared the artwork for the report. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Committee members and the secretariat. In particular, I thank John Cummins for his tremendous support and enthusiasm during the inquiry, and I trust that the report is sufficiently courageous. Thanks go also to Judy Ferris, who provided keyboard and administrative support. We all wish Judy well as she has temporarily left the Department to prepare for the birth of her second child. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on student financial assistance by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training represents months of intensive committee and secretariat examination of the means of assisting students with their living, books and incidental expenses during senior secondary and tertiary education. Australia has opted for a system of grants from government to students almost exclusively as a method of student financial assistance. Other countries use scholarships, bursaries, student loans, parental tax relief and grants to accomplish the same end. In Australia student loans are generally available only to tertiary students and then on only a very limited basis. It was our intention to evaluate the possibility of expanding loans assistance to students, but the Australian Bankers Association seemed not to be particularly interested, so that investigation, in essence, lapsed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For whatever reason or combination of reasons, individuals in industry have not seen fit to endow our universities with major scholarships or bursaries to the extent practised in older democratic countries with larger populations. We made no examination of this area of financial assistance. No consideration whatsoever was given during the inquiry to the potential use of the taxation system as a form of government assistance for parents' contributions to students' costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, considering all of the above, this report is an examination of the efficacy, efficiency and effectiveness of Austudy. Personally, I am disappointed that our report is devoted almost entirely to Austudy rather than examining the broader issues of options that might and ought to be considered for the future. From the limited evidence received by the Committee it is obvious that other countries are moving away from a grants system as the major or sole method of providing assistance to students for their study. </PARA>
<PARA> Pressures from a multitude of directions on the public purse, combined with a need to reduce government spending as well as economic pressure on access, make it increasingly difficult in the 1990s for Australia to continue to support its students with only a grant scheme. The Budget estimate for this financial year for Austudy and Abstudy exceed $1.1 billion, and for 17 million people that is a lot of money. I have no doubt that if consideration is given only to equity, and if the system itself is fair and meets its objectives, then a grants system is the ideal. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal country or an ideal world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that for a whole host of reasons pressures on our secondary and tertiary institutions for expanded access are immense. This year, in Victoria alone, there are 9,000 qualified students unable to obtain places in university, and 35,000 rejected applications at technical and further education colleges. In addition, tertiary institutions acknowledge they have overfilled the number of places which should have been offered to students in Victoria by 7,000 in this current school year. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, while I might wish the report to be more broad in scope, the report is about Austudy and clearly the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) has failed to deliver what Australians think the system is all about. The report is a damning indictment of DEET and of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The report says, in essence, that the Government has not provided clear policy objectives for student financial assistance, that the Department has not made any attempt to determine whether or not the system delivers Government objectives and that, in addition to administration problems, the system probably does not pass the test of respective equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report of December 1989, as the Chairman has rightly pointed out, made 124 recommendations for changes in DEET procedures and this report makes 28 recommendations with respect to both policy and procedure. It is my view that the program delivery aspects of Austudy should be transferred to the Department of Social Security. The system itself is highly complex. The forms are a nightmare, and DEET uses a centralised system for ultimate evaluation and delivery of payment. A centralised system has meant, in essence, that many students are left waiting for a long period of time unaware of whether or not they will obtain assistance, whereas the decentralised system used by Social Security provides more ready access of information to clients. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee argued that, philosophically, the grants system is not to be seen as a social security measure and that DEET should be given one more chance. Frankly, I think the philosophical argument is ridiculous because it matters not to the student what department dispenses the cheque or what department determines eligibility, as long as the assistance is received. Clearly, the Department of Social Security is much more expert in these affairs and has the capacity and proven performance to handle program evaluation and payment delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends a number of changes to parental income and assets tests on the basis of more accurately targeting those in genuine need. Stories abound of sons and daughters of wealthy parents receiving Austudy through loopholes in the system. Clearly, fringe benefits are given in lieu of income and should be considered along with taxable income in order to determine eligibility. I would go further than the Committee, however, and recommend to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the fringe benefits tax system be changed so that such benefits are taxed in the hands of the receiver rather than the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Fringe benefits would then form a portion of taxable income where applicable and the problem would be solved. The Committee recommendations to exclude taxation deductions derived from negatively geared property, superannuation and prior years losses is in my view not equitable unless the Treasurer wants to change the taxation system in major respects to disallow such deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agonised long and hard over finding the most equitable and efficient means to assist rural and isolated families, as both would appear to be the most disadvantaged at the moment. Our recommendations to increase allowable student personal income and to progressively reduce the age for establishing independent status will no doubt be controversial within the Minister's Department. The Committee believed, however, that it is not equitable to penalise students who are willing to help themselves versus those who are not. Clearly, Austudy cannot provide all of the income support that a student requires. The increase in income limit to $8,000, and any change in the reduction formula from 50c to 25c in every dollar in excess, should be of major benefit to many students who are willing and able to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, the age criterion for independence must be set at no higher than age 21, and the progressive reduction recommended should accommodate orderly change. I do not believe the Committee's recommendation that a discount on allowable assets for businesses be discontinued is either sensible or equitable. I would personally argue that, if we are going to have an assets test on a grants scheme, then recognition must be given to the very major difference between productive and non-productive assets. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt but that this report will be controversial. We have made many hard, firm recommendations which must be taken seriously by the Minister and by the bureaucracy. I would join the Chairman in thanking both the Committee for their long, hard hours of work and the Committee Secretary Mr John Cummins, Judy and the rest of his staff for a mammoth job well done. I recommend the report to the Minister and to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in the presentation of this report Student Financial Assistance to the House, as I believe it is an excellent document tackling a broad range of structural and administrative difficulties in Austudy. It is a timely reappraisal of this relatively new scheme which will place it on a much better footing to achieve its aims and objectives. I would first like to place on the record my thanks and congratulations to the Chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). It is a pleasure to work with a person who demonstrates such compassion, commitment and understanding, and who also brings to the task an incisiveness and decisiveness which ensured that we were able to complete this major report in very good time indeed. My appreciation also goes to the Secretary of our Committee, John Cummins, whose experience, understanding and calm operation ensured that we kept on task and did the job well: thanks, John.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report into student financial assistance will be well received by everyone who is concerned about fairness, effectiveness and efficiency in the Commonwealth's Austudy scheme. The Committee, through the 28 recommendations in this report, has tackled the most important issues which were raised in submissions and public hearings about the failure of Austudy to live up to its aims and objectives. There are a number of speakers to follow me this morning, so I will concentrate my remarks on a specific number of recommendations. Having been a recipient of support under the former tertiary education assistance scheme during my years at university from 1972 to 1975, I was concerned at the current rigidity and harshness of the rules regarding independent status and allowance for private income. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's hearings around Australia and in many submissions received, we were advised of the considerable difficulties and quite unjust repercussions experienced by thousands of Austudy recipients because of the current regulations. At the moment, a student has to be 25 years old to be considered automatically as living independent of parental support, unless married or classified as homeless. The National Union of Students stated that the overwhelming source of most complaints from their members on Austudy was on the question of independent status. All student bodies argued that the age requirements for independent status must be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> To quote from the University of Sydney, Students Representative Council (SRC) submission:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . despite a wealth of legal material verifying age 18 as the age of independence . . . the Government continues to force citizens who in every other respect (voting, health insurance, licences, drinking age, etc) are seen as full citizens, to be relegated to being a `dependent' if they happen to choose tertiary education. The SRC's case work overwhelmingly shows that the majority of students are financially self supporting from age 18 even if they live in the family home. </PARA>
<PARA>In recommendation 11 the Committee has recommended that the age at which a student can be considered automatically as living independent of parental support should be lowered progressively over four Budgets to 21 years. I would have preferred to have made the change immediately, as I agree with all the submissions that 25 is a totally unreasonable and unrealistic age level. However, the cost of this measure is over $100m a year and could not be absorbed in one Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> For people under this age to claim independent status, the current criteria are also quite unreasonable. At present, the student has to have been in full time employment for three out of the last four years to qualify as independent. This criterion discriminated against part time employment and made it very difficult for recipients of unemployment benefits in particular to prove their case, because of the failure of the Department of Social Security to keep records after one year. The Committee has recommended a reduction in this period to become two years work out of the last three and has also allowed for income levels to be the determinant, not whether the source of income was from full or part time employment. These changes will considerably improve the situation for most students seeking the independent rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation which I strongly support and which was also the subject of considerable submission concerns the allowable personal income levels. It was of some concern to the Committee that there has been no attempt to assess the actual cost of living for students in Australia. A number of different estimates were given to us, but when the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) was first asked it did not give this issue very high priority. Subsequently the Department has decided to undertake a survey into student finances and living costs. Without the benefit of some accurate current data, I do not know how DEET can recommend to government an appropriate level of financial support for students, what it estimates the parent contribution to be or what level of personal income levels are reasonable. These are the three components of student survival, but we have been operating on guesstimates for a number of years. The report states on page 42:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee finds it disappointing that there has been little interest by the Government in ascertaining the students' cost of living until now. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee makes a recommendation that this survey be considered in the framing of the 1992 Budget. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>This study is essential to enable a proper evaluation of the effectiveness of student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the Committee has recommended that the amount allowed for students to earn before they start losing their Austudy has been doubled to $8,000 a year. Further, we recommend that the abatement rate be changed to the same as that for determining family income-that is, 25c in the dollar instead of the existing 50c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> DEET has come under some criticism in the report for its administrative performance with Austudy. Many honourable members will have received complaints, as I have, about the incredibly long delays in answering telephone inquiries, frustrating delays in processing application forms and the difficulties caused by inaccurate information being given to parents or students by DEET or Commonwealth Employment Service officers. The Committee has spent some time considering these issues and has made a series of worthwhile recommendations which we believe will help overcome these problems.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am pleased to report that the current anomaly which exists to exclude students attending private universities and colleges from receiving Austudy has been recommended for change. I do not see that, if students and their parents do comply with the eligibility criteria for Austudy and they are enrolled in a recognised institution, studying for degrees or diplomas which are accredited nationally, they should be discriminated against because they attend a private rather than public institution. This will be of particular benefit to a tertiary institution in my electorate, the Christian Heritage College, which is a private teacher training institution. I urge the Government to implement the recommendation on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I thank all my fellow Committee members and the secretariat staff for their dedication and patience in the preparation of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to address some of the issues raised in the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled Student Financial Assistance. I am aware that this inquiry has great significance for many young Australians. I am also aware that Federal Government financial assistance for students is a key element of the Commonwealth's strategy to enhance Australia's competitiveness. By removing the financial barriers to higher education, more and more young Australians will be given the opportunity to help lift Australia's overall economic performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An essential feature of a fair society is equality of educational opportunities. It is therefore the role of government to ensure that financial barriers are removed in education so that all Australians have the opportunity to participate in the wide and improved range of employment, education and training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disturbing revelation that although Federal governments have spent, and continue to spend, billions of dollars on programs such as Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme, there has never been a worthwhile assessment of the success of such schemes. Therefore, I am pleased to support the Committee's recommendation that the Government develop clear policy objectives for student financial assistance. I also support the recommendation that the Department of Employment, Education and Training should develop performance indicators in line with the Government's objectives and that the Department undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of the student financial assistance programs in achieving those objectives. For too long Federal governments have been spending enormous amounts of taxpayers' money on education programs without clear objectives and without continual assessment of their success or otherwise. This situation can no longer be tolerated, and the report is a valuable document in terms of bringing about immediate and substantial reforms in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The report lists many specific issues dealing with eligibility criteria. In the short time allocated to this debate this morning, I am not able to deal with these complex issues. However, I wish to stress to the House that the report highlights a number of anomalies and problems with the current system and it is imperative that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) instruct his Department to conduct a review of the current student financial assistance system in line with the recommendations outlined in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the administration of Austudy, the report correctly states that an effective program is one which is easy for the individual to understand and for program managers to administer. At present the Austudy scheme is complex and confusing, and the Committee makes the observation that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Austudy rules and regulations failed dismally on any test of plain English. </PARA>
<PARA>This is totally unacceptable and must be corrected immediately. A significant area of concern is the length and complexity of the Austudy application form. In 1990 the application contained 93 questions, and it is pleasing to note that the Department has made a number of changes to the 1991 form. Such reforms and improvements must continue. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate office has received a number of calls from students complaining that they have been unable to contact Austudy via the telephone inquiry service. My constituents have complained about an unacceptable waiting time, and the report addresses this issue. I am pleased that the Department, after the provision of $1 million from the Government, now aims to answer at least 80 per cent of telephone inquiries within five minutes and 75 per cent of counter inquiries within 15 minutes. If this objective is achieved, students seeking assistance will have a good first impression of the service, and a degree of efficiency will establish itself within the Austudy network. On the surface, recommendations calling for an improved telephone inquiry service may seem to be of little importance. On the contrary, my experience with student applicants suggests that it is a reform which is much awaited and most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I have a number of other comments I would have made, in view of the time we have available to us I feel in fairness I must allow time for other members of the Committee to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too will be brief in my comments out of consideration for the other members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training who wish to address the House on this important report. I am very pleased to have been involved in the compilation of this report, which looked at the provision of Austudy and has come down with a number of recommendations that enhance its efficiency, its targeting and its social equity outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to address the social equity aspects of the recommendations in the few minutes available to me this morning. The report recommends important changes which will improve the social equity outcomes of Austudy. It is true that some asset-wealthy families with high living standards have been able to obtain Austudy in the past. Key recommendations in this report seek to target Austudy assistance to those who are genuinely in need. I wish to refer to just a couple of the recommendations which head down that road. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some mention already of recommendation 3b, which deals with the questions of fringe benefits. it is an anomaly that fringe benefits are not included as part of the income for the purposes of determining eligibility for Austudy. This report recommends that fringe benefits be included in future as part of that determination. That is a proper and socially equitable approach to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> There are in the community people who as part of their wage and salary package are able to negotiate low interest loans, vehicles, family holidays, overseas trips, child bursaries and many other payments which are not included as taxable income for the individual but are met as fringe benefits tax paid by the employer. It is time that those sources of income, which very substantially affect a person's standard of living, were included as part of the income in determining access to Austudy. The days when students can arrive at university in BMWs and Mercedes Benzes and collect Austudy payments must end, and the report goes some way to addressing that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to make some comment about the age at which adult independent status is achieved. Historically, 25 years of age has been included in Austudy regulations. It defies logic, it defies practice in the community, and it ignores reality. The Committee's recommendation to establish 21 as the age at which independent status is arrived at is a sensible one. It takes note of the balance between what is the practice in the community and what is government's capacity to pay, and I believe it is a fair and reasonable recommendation. The proposals for its phased entry should enable the Government to endorse that recommendation and introduce it progressively over the next four Budgets. I strongly hope that it does so. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the recommendations concerning spouse income tests. In the last Budget a change was made to the spouse income test which resulted in a number of students who had previously received Austudy no longer being eligible for it. In my view, that has denied the nation a resource it can ill afford to lose. The facts are that a number of people in the community previously received Austudy and were successfully undertaking courses with the assistance of Austudy. This year they have not been eligible for Austudy. Typically, they are women in single income families who have been endeavouring to upgrade their skills and obtain improved qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people, who have done one, two, or in some cases three years of full time study and have had an investment placed in them by the community, now find that without Austudy they cannot continue their courses and are lost to the community. They will not complete their degrees; they will not complete their course work. That is a loss the country can ill afford at this time. It runs counter to the Government's clear commitment to Australia being a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the report recommends that the spouse income test for those who have successfully completed at least their first year of study revert to the old formula, and that those people who have successfully completed their first year be enabled to continue to receive Austudy for the purposes of completing their current courses. That is a sensible recommendation. It effectively phases in the arrangements announced in the last Budget rather than having them implemented in one fell swoop. It will enable many people in the community-predominantly women seeking to upgrade their skills in a single income family situation-to complete their courses and contribute more fully to our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I pay tribute to the chairperson of the Committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who I believe conducted the inquiry with professional and friendly leadership. I am indebted to him for his work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by echoing the compliments that have been directed to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). I think the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) may have gone a little over the top but, to pick up a couple of his adjectives, he described the Chairman as being a compassionate person. In respect of the honourable member for Chifley, and also the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I might say that their compassion would be enhanced somewhat if they gave up smoking at committee meetings. That would be greatly appreciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a new member of parliament, and this being my first committee, may I say how much I have enjoyed the committee work. It has been said that the role of the Chairman has been important. The Cummins crew-the secretariat, if you like-also enhanced the Committee hearings significantly, and the many hours we spent together travelling and in meetings and in deliberations achieved some results. The whole exercise, from my point of view, has been extremely worthwhile and enjoyable. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said about the second chapter of the report dealing with Austudy effectiveness. It seemed to me in many respects as we dealt with this important subject-and we are talking here of a program where the Government will spend in 1991 over $1 billion-that the effectiveness of that program ought to be something that exercises everybody's mind. Yet as has been said, and without wanting to belabour the point too much, I think the Committee was extremely concerned to find that there had not been, at any particular point of time, a detailed analysis carried out as to whether that $1 billion was actually being spent effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Finance, in appearing before the Committee, advised that mechanisms put in place to achieve the objectives of Austudy, as they had been spelled out, had not been evaluated to determine their effectiveness. The Committee dealt with the report of the audit that had been carried out in 1988, and that dealt substantially with the administrative efficiency of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we needed to distinguish, and we attempted to come to grips with, the difference between efficiency, which in a sense is doing things right, and effectiveness, which is doing the right things. The audit report, of course, dealt with administrative efficiency, and 124 recommendations came forward which were really, as I think others have said, an indictment of the performance of the Department of Employment, Education and Training in respect of its administration of the student assistance programs. But there are no real studies which tell us whether Austudy is in fact doing the right things. Here we have a program where we are spending $1 billion, yet we are not sure whether or not it is achieving its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I would think that the recommendations that the Committee has made in respect of the Government taking action to assess effectiveness, and in fact our recommendation in paragraph 2.31 that the Government develop clear policy objectives for student financial assistance and, further, that the Department develop performance indicators in line with those policy objectives, are in my view perhaps among the more important of the recommendations that have come from this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minute or so I have remaining, I will refer to a couple of concerns I had in looking at the program, particularly in relation to payment of Austudy to secondary students. Of the $1 billion or so that we are putting into this program, $350m is being used to keep kids in school. There was no indication in any way at all-and I think the Chairman actually alluded to this-that Austudy was contributing directly towards keeping kids at school. Obviously, in a sense, they are staying at school if they are being paid to be there, but the small amount of analysis that was done indicated that the vast majority of kids who were staying at school were staying there for other reasons. My concern in that area was that we ought to look particularly carefully at the effectiveness of Austudy in respect of the benefits it is having as far as retention rates in secondary schools are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I would like to make would echo other comments made about using taxable income as a basis for determining eligibility. I share the concerns of the Committee. I am not sure, although we have gone down the track of adding back into taxable income fringe benefits and other remunerative mechanisms, whether we are really solving that problem. I think it is a much bigger problem. It is a problem that the whole social security system needs to come to grips with-the fact that taxable income is so subject to manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA> I will let others have a go. I reiterate that I have enjoyed my involvement in this report. I think the mechanics, as far as a lot of the recommendations are concerned, are extremely important, and they will be welcomed by students in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, join my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to present a number of views and, of course, look at some of the issues raised. Suffice it to say that student financial assistance in Australia through the Austudy program attempts to address some of the inequities in our society and the barriers to education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all of us have found some dismay in the fact that we do not actually know quite whom we are targeting, although philosophically we would hope we are targeting those most in need. It is, of course, of no surprise to people to understand that those people currently within our tertiary system in fact, in socioeconomic terms, have changed very little. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason for this is that the changes in the socioeconomic mix in years 11 and 12 are absolutely imperative to getting a change and a breaking down of barriers within the tertiary system; hence, the payment of Austudy to students in years 11 and 12 is absolutely crucial and vital to ensuring that the barriers which remain in socioeconomic terms to people getting into tertiary education are removed earlier so that those students stay on in years 11 and 12. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, within this system there are still some anomalies. Recommendation 15 attempts to pick up some of those anomalies. Students who are 19 years of age may need to repeat year 12 for a whole range of purposes, be it a change of school, illness or practicalities. The barriers which have not enabled them to repeat year 12 are now being addressed. It is very important to break down these barriers so that people are able to participate in the tertiary system and take full advantage of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland there are serious disadvantages for people who did not have the opportunity to go to secondary school and decide that they would like to further their education. Honourable members should remember that most people over the age of 48 in Queensland did not participate in a high school education at all. A whole range of people in our community have not had the opportunity of secondary schooling. They may now return to secondary school to participate in what is known as the senior external studies course. Given the regulations that currently exist in Queensland, these students are precluded from sitting for more than a maximum number of examination subjects in a year. These students are then unable to receive Austudy support as the number of subjects is considered to be less than a full time load. We are targeting the people who have already been disadvantaged in our community who are making the effort to go back to school. We now find that they are ineligible for Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be part of a committee that addresses such inequity and anomalies. It recommends very clearly that our Minister for Education, Employment and Training (Mr Dawkins) speaks with the Queensland Minister and pursues that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also very happy to be part of a committee which addresses the whole question of apparent inequities in the service delivery area. Those people who have a copy of the report will note that the cartoon on page 28 addresses very effectively the anecdotal evidence of the inequities which the Austudy system has thrown up. We have had discussions about the way in which the service is delivered and the kinds of forms which are filled in. All of us in electorate offices can tell of people who have rung day in and day out. My longest time to get through to an Austudy office has been three days. I understand very clearly the needs and demands of people within the system. I say to the Department of Education, Employment and Training and to the Austudy people, `We have given you another chance, but remember that we are hanging on to the end of our telephones too'. </PARA>
<PARA> That kind of information that is sought needs to be streamlined. The form filling in, the processes and the way in which this service is delivered must be improved, not because we demand it, but because it must be student centred and must remove the barriers to education. Students must not be disadvantaged by constantly having to worry about whether their Austudy payment is going to come, whether the form has to be filled or whether changes are going to be made to their entitlement when they are in the process of study. </PARA>
<PARA> The delays do exactly the reverse of what the Austudy payment sets out to do; that is, to provide an opportunity for people to study. We say to departmental officers, `Remove these barriers which students are having so that they may participate fully within our education system and enjoy the benefits which the Austudy payments bring to them'. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am delighted to be part of the recommendations regarding technical and further education (TAFE). As many will understand, the TAFE sector of our higher education has traditionally been for those people who have been less advantaged in our community, so we have included TAFE. We need more student counselling services, we need better delivery services, we need more aware students, we need to be more aggressive in the way in which services within TAFE are delivered, and we also need Austudy to be delivered to students in the TAFE sector in a much better, more caring and a very much more equitable way. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend this report to the House. I acknowledge the work of our chairperson, who has been excellent in pulling together what has been an enormous range of diverse views in at times a very heated and concerned debate. I also acknowledge the work of John Cummins and the secretariat, who have supported us through what has been a very interesting and exhaustive process, but if students benefit from this then our work will have been more than worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by acknowledging the introduction of the Chairman, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). It was a valuable and well expressed outline of the report Student Financial Assistance and the work of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I commend him for it. It is not appropriate for me to enter into discussions as to whether he is more or less compassionate than the Deputy Chairman, but I certainly pay the honourable member the compliment of saying that he, as the Chairman of this Committee, is a delight to work under.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His comments about taxable income being an inappropriate basis for assessment of these types of grants are of course also timely and appropriate, as has been acknowledged here this morning. I will make a few comments about the farm and rural sector in a moment. He also covered the complexities and difficulties associated with the program. He acknowledged that the Department of Employment, Education and Training has, in the view of many including me, failed to perform at all well in this area. The report's recommendations and suggestions of alternatives, if the Department cannot manage these things more effectively in the future, are well taken on board and very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) challenged all of us to consider alternatives for future funding. To some extent the lack of behests, bursaries, scholarships and so forth reflects the fact that we are still a very young country. It also reflects the fact that in the past we have not valued education enough. There is a challenge to all thinking Australians and to all Australians who have benefited financially from the opportunities and privileges that this land presents to think carefully about what they might do in terms of providing scholarships, bursaries and this type of thing to educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We too, in our office in the country, have noted many of the problems with Austudy, particularly delays in the making of initial payments at the commencement of academic years. That has been a major problem for many students, particularly given that most costs are up front-the fees, the books, the accommodation setting-up costs and the transport for students from rural communities. We have noted the problem of a lack of clear advice from Austudy officers, often a source of major complaint and confusion. There is particularly the inability to provide concise information over the telephone to applicants and to the parents of applicants. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be an urgent need for quicker and more accurate assessment mechanisms so that parents know, in good time, what financial support they may have to provide for their student children. Many rural people have recently run into problems with valuations by the Australian Valuation Office of properties for asset purposes. Many parents have expressed a great deal of concern over the changes in property values and the resulting eligibility of Austudy, the question of evaluations being altered causing reassessments of eligibility and the question of overpayments and the liability for repayment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give my remarks this morning something of a rural flavour. It is not unusual for me to do that in this place but it is important for me to do so. Australia's farming community has the lowest level of formal educational achievement amongst Western industrialised countries. This is obviously a cause for great concern. Statistics compiled by the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture show that less than a quarter of the Australian farm work force possesses more than a lower secondary education. This contrasts with more than 50 per cent in New Zealand, North America and western Europe and upwards of 90 per cent in Scandinavian countries. </PARA>
<PARA> This falling behind worries me enormously. Australian rural communities, and farmers in particular, have had an excellent record for productivity improvement in Australia in the past. They have far outstripped all other sectors of the economy. But one of the things that will increasingly hold them back in the future is a lack of preparation at an education level to enable them to meet the challenges and grasp the opportunities of the future. Studies in Australia and the United States have shown that higher levels of education and training significantly improve farm productivity. That is important not only for the farmers involved in these tight times, but also for Australia, which is desperately in need of export improvement and enhancement. </PARA>
<PARA> I think, too, that there is a problem with our need to keep young people on the land. That problem is directly related to being able to better equip them to cope with the challenges that confront them. As I have indicated, that problem arises largely from the lack of education opportunities. Of course, that problem goes beyond the immediate farm sector and relates, for example, to the shortage of rural doctors in Australia. There is a need to attract rural students into areas of study such as medicine because rural students understand the bush, have an empathy for it and will return to it at the conclusion of their studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say that for all of those reasons it is vital that we grapple effectively with the problems outlined in the report and that we note in future the need to address the current horrific circumstances facing rural people. Following from that, there should be hardship provisions which will go to the heart of the problem of assets not being an accurate guide in rural Australia, particularly in times of downturn such as we have at the moment, to people's capacity to pay for their children's education. Whilst, for example, we do not support asset testing for isolated children's benefits or for family allowance, there is a need for reasonable parameters in regard to Austudy. That is fair; that is just. However, realism must prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to record that later this year members of the Committee will be moving around rural Australia in an attempt to establish firmly the full dimensions of the problems of education access and affordability for rural children resulting from the rural downturn. This will be vitally important work. I hope and trust that we will be able to construct proper programs to enable rural students to enjoy due access to study and to continue any study they have undertaken. Again, I commend the report and all who have put so much work into it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 95 per cent for the whole State. I am very pleased to be associated with the tabling of the report on student financial assistance by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I believe this report makes an important contribution to the debate on student financial assistance and that it reflects positively on the worth of the parliamentary committee system. The chairperson, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the members of the Committee and the secretariat, ably led by John Cummins, are to be congratulated on exhibiting a considerable strength and unanimity of purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Austudy is a billion dollar program, with 395,000 students expected to be assisted this year. This figure includes 160,000 students at tertiary level, which represents an increase of 16.6 per cent since 1987-88. It includes 168,000 students at secondary level, an increase of 28 per cent since 1987-88. Importantly, it includes 8,000 adult secondary students, an increase of 44.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As can be clearly shown, Austudy is the substantive program that has contributed significantly to assisting students to make the decision to further their education and build the clever country. However, like all schemes involving the human element, it can be improved. This report points the way. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on three of the Committee's recommendations concerning the scheme's purpose, personal income levels and consultation. My first point concerns the purposes of the scheme. The Committee felt that the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) needs to make a concerted move to actually establish that the Austudy program is meeting is stated aims. DEET's largely subjective assessments are not in question and have validity. However, they need to be supported by objective measures. No-one should underestimate the difficulty of that task, for much that is measured in education is indeed subjective, and will continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Committee agreed that DEET must also make assessments to reconcile aims, delivery and outcomes with proper performance indicators. The resultant objective data from those assessments to support Austudy meeting its stated aims is a prerequisite for any intelligent consideration of alternative or changed means of financial assistance to students. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point concerns personal income limits. DEET provided details to the Committee which suggested that the income test has little impact on most students. In fact, it was suggested that only 6 per cent of recipients reported income over $3,000. However, I seriously doubt the validity of those figures and suspect that the income levels of $3,000 and currently $4,000 may in fact encourage students to actually beat the system by not declaring income. More importantly, I believe that students should be encouraged to work part time. My own anecdotal records support the notion that students who have worked are more, and not less, successful in gaining their preferred employment at the completion of their studies. A quite considerable number of students who have completed tertiary studies have come to my office seeking assistance to find employment. There was one common factor in every case: none had had any work experience outside the school or home. None had had any experience doing the normal things of selling or delivering papers, working in a garage, takeaway, supermarket or retail outlet. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee believes that a personal income level should be maintained. The Committee's recommendation that the personal income limit be doubled to $8,000 and that the abatement rate be 25c in the dollar is both fair and realistic, and it reflects the reality of remuneration for part time work and reward for self-help. </PARA>
<PARA> My last point refers to the consultative process of the Austudy Planning Group. Whilst applauding the establishment of the group, which consists of DEET officers, the National Union of Students and the Australian and New Zealand Student Services Association, the Committee agreed that the Austudy Planning Group should be both formalised and expanded. As it is now, the group represents only the views of the higher education sector. I get particularly annoyed at the arrogance and superiority, albeit it unintended at times, of the higher education sector in its treatment of the technical and further education (TAFE) and the schools sectors as second and third rate partners in education. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher education sector is well known in TAFE and schools for its outstanding knowledge of subject disciplines-and also for its condescending, patronising and, in reality, out of date and insular attitudes to those sectors that are not in its club but nevertheless are of critical importance to the whole education system. The inclusion of TAFE and schools representation will strengthen the Austudy Planning Group and, indeed, will widen the often cloistered view of the higher education sector to more accurately reflect the views that are necessary to discuss changes and difficulties relating to student financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The strength and wisdom of our education system does not filter down from higher education to TAFE, secondary and primary schools. It flows in both directions, but more often in the opposite direction. Until education bureaucrats realise that, improvements to our whole education system will be marginal and not substantive. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for allowing me time to speak at the end of this debate. The report on student financial assistance is a worthwhile document which has canvassed the issues surrounding student financial assistance in a broad and well-considered manner. In determining the report's content, the Committee was not afraid to deal with the matters of contention, to challenge the reasons for the existence of Austudy and to question whether Austudy can be seen to be fulfilling its objectives. For instance, the Committee in its report draws attention to the fact that if Austudy is not seen by the Government as meeting total living costs, it is both illogical and unjust that the income which students may earn, before allowances are affected, is set at levels which do not enable them to meet their cost of living. I agree with the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) that having to work does not do students any harm and, in fact, can help students with subsequent job prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consequently, the Committee believes that the allowable level of personal income should be doubled to $8,000-I totally agree with that-although it does not advocate the abolition of the personal income test in any way, shape or form. Furthermore, as the Chairman has indicated, in accepting that the use of taxable income is an administratively simple means of assessing Austudy eligibility, the Committee noted that in many cases it is an extremely poor measure of a person's ability to meet education costs. The Committee found it unacceptable that inequities in the taxation system result in the payment of allowances to those people who are well able to meet their own, or their children's, education costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, financial assistance by itself is not sufficient to ensure equality of access to education. But I believe it to be the primary requirement to achieve such an end. Family and society attitudes to education also need to be addressed to make any substantive impact in the short term-I agree with the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) in that regard-although, in the longer term, the existence of a simple and realistic income support for students from lower income families will achieve the desired change and social mix in education across the board. I would like to commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House notes the positive impact on investment patterns in Australia following the introduction of a fair and equitable capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anybody could doubt that, when measuring the changes in tax laws, the Hawke Government's tax reforms would have to be the greatest in the history of this country. The one constant in the changes in the taxation laws in this country is that they have always been opposed by the Opposition. I would like to spend a little time looking at some of those changes and the impact they have had. </PARA>
<PARA> When we changed the tax deductibility arrangements on entertainment expenses we heard a lot of noise from the Opposition about the impact that would have on the restaurant and catering industry. Indeed, we had demonstrations in front of Parliament House, joined by then spokespeople for the Opposition. We can look back now and say that all of the predictions were untrue. In fact, the catering and tourism industries are flourishing, despite the fact that people cannot book up the cost of meals and entertainment to the general taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, with the fringe benefits tax a lot of predictions were made about the doom and gloom that would descend on business. That has not happened. The fringe benefits tax has been a very successful move to tax formally some of those areas that once escaped tax-areas where people, usually executives, could come up with a package by which they evaded paying tax. This year we expect that that tax alone will bring in $1,280m. That is tax that was not paid under the coalition Government. It is tax that is currently being paid. I believe that, with hindsight, the Opposition has recognised that it was wrong in its attack on the fringe benefits tax and has opted to keep it should it become the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus today on the capital gains tax, which directly this year will bring in $775m. It is hard to estimate indirectly just how much tax that will bring in, but it will certainly be in excess of $1 billion. That would be the cost of getting rid of it. Yesterday I heard the dulcet tones of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) speaking on a tax Bill. He was talking about the impact of different rates of indirect taxes and the distortions they may cause in the tax system. Of course, he was right. There is no doubt that the higher tax on some goods may influence people either to buy or not to buy. I think he was referring yesterday to luxury cars. </PARA>
<PARA> If that holds true, we would have to be drawn by the same argument to the fact that, in the absence of the capital gains tax, investment patterns would be distorted. It would be a lot easier, for instance, for people to invest money in speculative activities rather than put it into areas that will do the country some good, that is, into the tradeable goods sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I was looking around for figures that may support that argument. I must say that they are very hard to find because quite often figures are not kept on the categories of speculative or productive investment. I have a couple of tables which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. I have checked them with the Opposition spokesman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. If we look at these two tables as an indication of the impact of the capital gains tax on manufacturing in Australia, we find that the table relating to private new fixed capital shows that in the year prior to the introduction of the capital gains tax the investment of private capital in manufacturing was $3,842m. In 1989-90, the latest year for which figures are available, that had risen to $8,418m, a significant increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tables also show in percentage terms that manufacturing has constantly outstripped both mining and finance, property and business services. The finance, property and business services, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, incorporate the rapid expansion of the tourism sector, where we have seen inbound tourism to Australia more than double under the policies of this Government. That is a fairly impressive statistic to show that the capital gains tax on manufacturing is the thing that is going to pull this country up and make it a better place to be and a more significant economic power. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly in relation to fixed capital investment, we would have to agree, on the figures supplied by the statistics group of the Parliamentary Library, that the capital gains tax may have had a beneficial effect; it is hard to say. Another indicator is manufactured exports-the amount of exports going out of the country, so that we do not have to rely on unprocessed raw materials and primary products. </PARA>
<PARA> The other table shows export growth. When looking at the volume of exports we find that, in volume terms, between the years 1983-84 and 1989 rural grew by 16 per cent, mining grew by 67 per cent, metals manufacturing grew by 45 per cent, and manufacturing grew by 98 per cent. Once again, the figures covering the years in which the capital gains tax was introduced clearly show that it has not hurt exports. In fact, exports have been enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is true for volumes, we would have to look at the value of exports. Once again, if the volume of exports has gone up by 98 per cent, the value of those manufactured exports leaving the country has gone up by 159 per cent, far outstripping any other broad sector that is indicated in the table I have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> So the predictions at the time the capital gains tax was brought in have not been borne out. The figures show that the capital gains tax has actually helped Australia in the areas in which it needs to be helped-which is not by putting high rise towers on the Gold Coast, those speculative activities where people could get a big capital gain tax free, as they would do under the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Opposition will raise the impact on small business. Now that we are collecting capital gains tax in Australia, the impact on small business is this: small businesses currently pay 1.4 per cent-less than 1 1/2 per cent-of the capital gains tax. Big business-that is, large companies which represent in total number less than 1 1/2 per cent of all businesses in Australia-pays more than 66 per cent. So we can see that the impact of the capital gains tax is on large business, not on small business, when capital gains tax is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, capital gains tax is paid only when one sells something. The capital gains tax itself has no impact whatsoever on the day to day running of a business. I think the figures I have used here today show that, in the manufacturing sector, under a capital gains tax regime exports have actually gone up significantly, and they will do into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not know what the Opposition's policy is. We assume that it is going to bring in the speculative capital gains tax it spoke about at the last election. Let me remind the Opposition of some of the things that were said about that speculative capital gains tax by the economic writers of some newspapers around Australia. On 29 October 1989 the Melbourne Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock-</PARA>
<PARA>he was then Opposition Leader, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>proposes to turn back the clock and once again unleash the might of the legal, accounting and financial professions in the drive to turn otherwise taxable income into tax-free capital gains of five year's standing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is unacceptable-not only on equity grounds, but in terms of the very changes necessary to make Australia more competitive and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>That is borne out by the statistics I have used today. The Australian Financial Review said:</PARA>

<PARA>There is not a paper in this country that supported the Opposition's view that there should be a speculative capital gains tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only advantage of this debate today is that it draws in very stark contrast the difference between the Government's attitude towards capital gains tax and the attitude of the Opposition. The point needs to be emphasised that while the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who has just spoken on this subject, may claim that there are certain advantages for Australia having a capital gains tax, perhaps the two words which draw most attention are `fair' and `equitable' which he used in his motion but throughout his 10 minutes made absolutely no attempt at all to justify.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the House would be better served to note that during the Labor Government's time in office-now over eight years-we have seen the biggest asset price boom in post-war history and we are now seeing the biggest bust since the Great Depression. The assets price boom was concentrated in property and particularly in home ownership. Prices of houses in Sydney, for example, more than doubled, pricing young home buyers out of the market, and people should note that capital gains tax contributed undoubtedly to that outcome. The family home was not taxed but productive investment was, contributing to a property boom which served no purpose other than to dramatically increase borrowings, without a corresponding increase in traded goods investment to pay for those borrowings. Effectively, therefore, the point I emphasise is this: selective capital gains tax cannot work and cannot be equitable. Yet that is the word which the honourable member used in his motion. He spoke of an equitable capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia undoubtedly needs is an incentive for individuals and businesses to take the long term risks to build enterprises capable of participating in the international market place. Most of our major trading partners in fact have a lower or negligible rate of tax on long term capital gains. What we hear so often from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), but which this particular tax policy flies entirely in the face of, is this: if Australia is going to compete internationally, we must have a total tax package which is also able to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular area, the facts are quite clear. The Australian capital gains tax regime is significantly more onerous than in most other comparable societies. Many countries tax long term gains at a lower rate than short run gains. In France, Germany, Finland, Ireland, Belgium and Denmark, for example, longer term gains on different assets are either exempt or taxed at a lower rate. We must make a similar approach in our tax system if we are to set the right incentive to work, to save and to invest, and begin to trade our way out of the hole which the present Government has put Australia in. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of small business-the matter derided by the honourable member-in developing our speculative tax proposal we set out to remove a major disincentive to establish or to expand small businesses. The Government's capital gains tax discourages anyone from starting up a small business, for expanding a small business or extending their business. In fact, the present tax discriminates against small business because when a person transfers from one business to another he has to pay the capital gains tax on the way through, which obviously influences his capacity to adequately capitalise his investment in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal of the Opposition-the speculative gains tax which phases out over five years-is a far more equitable arrangement because it does identify where there is speculation. It does levy a 100 per cent tax in the first year. That tax then phases out over five years because clearly an investment over five years cannot be regarded as a capital investment of a speculative nature. But under the Government's proposal, irrespective of how long a person keeps an investment, it is apparently, a speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax acts as a brake on entrepreneurial capacity. Proprietors of businesses are saddled with a multitude of charges which already make Australian business uncompetitive overseas. We have levies and obligations when staff are employed and, on top of those disincentives, business people are subject to tax on capital gains made on the very same goodwill that has been built up over a period of time by their hard work. When that goodwill is taxed the business person is less able to invest in a new and possibly larger business, with all the macro-and micro-economic advantages which can stem from that. The National Director of the Australian Small Business Association said `Keating's capital gains tax is like a brick wall in front of business incentive', and he suggested that the coalition's policy will entice investors into looking at the longer term areas of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Most assets in Australia are subject to capital gains tax and they are owned or controlled by the major institutions-the life offices, the fund managers and the superannuation funds. So the tax in fact falls directly on the savings of hard working Australians trying to build up a reasonable retirement income. This was an issue in the last election. The Treasurer and other members of the Government did their best to obfuscate on this fundamental issue, but the fact of the matter is it is not right for the honourable member simply to claim that the capital gains tax is paid by a minuscule number of small businesses. The truth of the matter is not just that small business paid 1.4 per cent of capital gains tax and so-called big business 66 per cent; it is also paid by millions of Australians through their contributions to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also fails to consider the many factors that could be said to impact on patterns of investment, not the least of which is the general state of the economy and our economic outlook, an impact of which the present Government has ultimately first hand responsibility for the shambles which we are now in. The level of interest rates and any changes in financial market regulations are but two of the other significant factors which impact upon the decision making processes of management. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, the motion from the honourable member for Canning is out of touch with the present state of economic events and the present state of the Australian taxation system as a whole. As in so many other areas, the taxation system is no longer comparative with similar economies overseas. It desperately needs reform. It is a reform which we hoped we were going to see from the Treasurer at the time of his tax summit a few years ago. It is a reform which the Opposition parties have guaranteed to the Australian people as being one of the fundamental planks upon which we will go the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> With the sales tax reforms in the industry statement, the main criticism from industry was that the reforms were in the right direction but of an insignificant level. The business input exemptions are worth $375m, but the total incidence of wholesale sales tax on business inputs is $5 billion to $6 billion, and significantly the wholesale sales tax incidence on Australian exports is about $1.2 billion. Yet the honourable member for Canning claims that this capital gains tax has improved our access to overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact about these reforms is that they provide minimal relief and add complexity to a tax system bulging over with inefficiencies, inconsistencies and disincentives-a thousand and one bandaids added to virtually every budget and every time a tax bill comes into this House. The wholesale sales tax is a mess. It is very narrowly based with complex multiple rates, riddled with anomalies, subject to costly litigation and distorts demand and production decisions in the Australian economy. The National Taxation Summit of 1985, to which I have referred, gave the Government the opportunity to look at the fundamentals of the tax system. Like the rest of the world, the Treasurer realised the necessity of shifting away from such a heavy reliance on income tax to a system incorporating a broad-based consumption tax-the famous option C which he dropped at that time, and for which the Australian people will remember him. What we have now, however, as a result of that summit, is a capital gains tax, a fringe benefits tax, and very little reform of the fundamentals. Leading tax economist Professor John Head said that the end product has been an incomplete reform leaving loopholes that were increasingly being exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stop was the bunkers early last year where an earnest effort was made to produce a package of simplified measures which gathered dust in the Treasurer's in tray. We saw a few dribbles of these measures in the March industry statement with depreciation and sales tax simplifications which were really just cleaning up the edges of the vast quagmire of taxation complexity which has been given to the Australian people by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As for those piecemeal measures, the Australian Taxpayers Association has complained of problems and inequities inherent in the depreciation changes and we are yet to see what problems are inherent in the sales tax simplifications. The fundamentals remain in place. They are out of sync with the developments in most other Western economies. The wholesale sales tax on goods may have worked in the 1930s. It will not work today. When an electorate wise to the illusory ways of the present Government votes it out of office at the next election, they will be sanctioning a fundamental shift in the taxation system from an emphasis on income tax alone to income and consumption in line with the rest of the Western world and, in particular, members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The goods and services tax, which, I emphasise, was supported by the Treasurer, is a much more simple and basic reform of the taxation system which will do far more for Australia than the current capital gains tax introduced by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) started his speech by referring to capital gains tax. In the end he got lost in a mire of other taxes. What I would say is that he had the effrontery to talk about equity when discussing a capital gains tax and the fact that the present tax does not reflect equity in the system. `Equity' of course is a euphemism for `fairness' or `justice'. So what he is suggesting is that it is okay for us to tax profits; it is okay for us to tax wages; it is okay for us to tax rental; it is okay for us to tax dividends; it is okay for us to tax interest-but when it comes to a capital gain that is made from selling a bunch of shares or a speculative real estate deal or whatever else, then that is tax free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That does not reflect equity in the system and by no understanding of the term or the issue can any of us accept that, if we sell a bunch of shares or we sell some property and make a speculative gain on that in any income year, that income is any different from the other income earned in that year. That is all a capital gains tax does. It makes that income taxable. Previously, it created distortions in investment; it created distortions in the decisions that were made by individuals because it did not exist. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) has pointed out and drawn a causal relationship-somewhat woolly, I admit-between those two things. But what I would say is that a priori the argument is indefensible that this tax provides equity. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the honourable member for Bradfield earlier in his speech argued, I think, if I heard him correctly, for a capital gains tax to be levied on the family home. If that is the position that the Opposition is putting, then we would support it, because this is what is needed in this country. If the Opposition is talking about fairness and equity in the system, then it should put forward that proposition. If it believes that is the way to go, then it should do so. But it should not go to an election, as it did last time, saying that it was going to give a speculative windfall gain to all of those people out there; that it would have retrospective tax relief for all of those people back to September 1985. That is what the Opposition went to the election suggesting-a huge windfall gain to all of those who were speculating on property and shares and who looked forward to making those sorts of gains. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that, when we came to office, this tax was not in place; and it represented a gaping hole in the taxation system in this country. What we have done is to fill that hole. It was mentioned by the honourable member for Canning that something like $770m is expected to be accrued in revenue for the Government in this financial year. Whether or not that actual figure is reached, it is likely that now, this year, as a result of this tax-tax that is paid largely by wealthy companies and by wealthy taxpayers-the moneys accrued will be available for schools, hospitals and government programs; and it represents equity. It is not envy; it is equity and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other holes in our taxation system, and one of them of course is the intergenerational transfers, which are untaxed in this country but which are taxed in almost every like Western nation. There has to be consideration of these. I am sure that even the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) would accept that there is no such thing as an undeserving four-year-old; and yet the fact that one four-year-old can come into this life with tremendous advantages against another suggests that maybe there is a role for redistribution. If we support progressive taxation and if we are concerned about fairness and justice, then we have to consider that issue-and intergenerational transfers reflect another area. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to this particular proposal, what I would say quite simply is that the majority of this tax is collected from share and real estate deals which were previously untaxed. It represents a change in taxation policy which has brought about an improvement in the fairness and justice of the system. If the Opposition goes to the next election suggesting, as it did last time, that it is going to retrospectively allow windfall gains for people; if it is going to decrease the efficiency, the integrity and the competitiveness of our taxation system; and if it is going to provide tax-free capital gains once again to fuel all of the spivs and the people who were involved in paper companies throughout the 1970s-then that is a mistake. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) shows his ignorance of this whole capital gains tax debate because he has not addressed the motion that he put forward to this House. The positive impact of the capital gains tax is negative, in fact, on domestic housing investment, real estate and the share market, and causes a lack of flexibility for businesses in whatever they might do in their business investment. I will refer to small business later; but in terms of the roll-over provisions for capital gains tax, small businessmen's investment plans are caused great inflexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) quite rightly has suggested the inequity between those people who own their own home and who have no capital gains tax, and those who make investments in other areas. If the honourable member for Perth and the Government are fair dinkum about the capital gains tax, why do they not put a capital gains tax on domestic dwellings throughout Australia-if that is their position and view? They are not game to because there is an inequity and an inconsistency in their position: they are not prepared politically to implement a capital gains tax which theoretically and logically should be placed on domestic dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> So that is the position of the honourable member for Perth. He almost indicated that he was prepared to do it because he supported the capital gains tax. Because there is no capital gains tax on domestic dwellings, individuals and people have renovated their houses and skewed investment has taken place in the domestic dwelling market. The great dream of every Australian to own a quarter-acre block and their own home has been greatly skewed by the capital gains tax introduced by this Government. Now we have a situation where investment moves away from productive investment in manufacturing, in farming and in businesses to these other forms of investment, such as domestic dwellings. People who invest in business, as the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) said, have to pay income tax; payroll tax; company tax; 3 per cent superannuation; and wholesale tax, where they are not sure how much they are going to pay-10, 20 or 30 per cent. Then, of course, at the conclusion of their business activity, they are faced with a capital gains tax on their total business sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The inconsistency and inequity of the capital gains tax are demonstrated by the goodwill component. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself has admitted that, in a business of more than $1m where there is a goodwill component, the first 20 per cent will be exempt. So there is an inequity in the situation of an Aussie battler who starts from nothing to make a business of some magnitude in that he will be charged a great amount of capital gains tax for doing so-and the Treasurer concedes that. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the revenue estimates, when the capital gains tax was brought in, the Treasurer said that there would be about $5m in the first year and $25m in the fifth year. So much for that. In the year 1990-91, $775m is expected to be raised by the capital gains tax. I draw attention to the inequity between individuals, who will contribute about $306m, and companies, who will contribute about $237m-a total of $540m in the last financial year, 1988-89. Where is the equity between individuals and companies in their contributions to the capital gains tax? Why was there comparatively small payment by companies in the boom years of the late 1980s? It is worth drawing to the attention of the House, particularly the honourable member for Canning, that the contribution of the former provision of 26aaa might distort these figures in the amount of money gained by way of revenue in the capital gains tax. Under the old regime of 26aaa, there would have been a suitable amount of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax is inequitable in that it is a de facto probate duty. At a point of transfer, capital gains tax will then begin to run. In the current rural recession, land values are depressed; if there is a transfer by way of family arrangements, this will be taken at the low point, and some five or ten years hence unsuspecting farmers will be held up for a de facto probate capital gains tax, which they do not fully realise. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) notes the overwhelming votes in Latvia and Estonia on 3 March 1991 and in Lithuania on 9 February 1991 in favour of independence from the Soviet Union;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government of the Soviet Union to respect the results of these referendums and to concede the right of independence to the Baltic States;</PARA>

<PARA> (4) believes the Australian Government should join with other like-minded governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to the three referendums. </PARA>
<PARA>The passage of this motion will enable the House to carry a motion in the same terms as that already carried unanimously in the Senate on 7 March. That motion noted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the overwhelming votes in Latvia and Estonia on 3 March 1991 and in Lithuania on 9 February 1991 in favour of independence from the Soviet Union . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It called on the Government of the Soviet Union:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to respect the results of these referendums and to concede the right of independence to the Baltic States . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It demanded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Soviet Union unequivocally renounces the use of force in its dealings with the Baltic states and respects normal modes of dealing between states . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also said that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . believes the Australian Government should join with other like-minded Governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to the three referendums. </PARA>
<PARA>The referendums voting in favour of independence are a major step forward for the people of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. I believe it is important for us in this place to adopt the motion, not only as a mark of respect for their courage but as an indication that we are prepared to stand with them in their continuing struggle for independence. The referendums demonstrate to the Soviet Union and to the rest of the world the great and continuing desire of the people of the Baltic states to regain the freedom snatched so terribly from them over 50 years ago. President Gorbachev must also take notice of these referendums. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion notes the overwhelming votes in the three states. In Latvia, 90 per cent of the population voted and 73 per cent of voters answered yes to the question `Are you in favour of a democratic and independent republic of Latvia?'. Of the 2.6 million people in Latvia, 53.7 per cent are ethnic Latvian, 32.8 per cent are Russian, 4.5 per cent are Byelorussian, and the remainder are Polish, Ukranian, Lithuanian, Jewish or are from other ethnic groups. In the capital of Latvia, Riga, which has the largest Russian speaking population of the three Baltic states, the voter turn-out reached nearly 85 per cent, with only about 63 per cent of the people supporting the proposal for independence and 34 per cent opposing it. The ballots suggest that large numbers of the Russian speaking minority in each of the three Baltic republics prefer independence from Moscow. I think that is very telling. </PARA>
<PARA> In neighbouring Estonia, more than 80 per cent of the population voted, and 77 per cent of voters said yes to the question `Do you favour the establishment of independence and State autonomy for the republic of Estonia?'. Of the 1.5 million people in Estonia, 64 per cent are Estonian, 27.9 per cent are Russian and the rest of the population is made up of other ethnic groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninety-one per cent of Lithuanians voted for independence on 9 February. More than 80 per cent of the 3.7 million people in Lithuania are ethnic Lithuanians, so the pro-independence vote here should not have come as any surprise. </PARA>
<PARA> President Gorbachev, in my view, must now surely recognise that the desire for independence is not confined to radical extremists, but represents the deepest and express wish of the people living in each of the Baltic republics. The future of the three Baltic republics rests on the Soviet Union beginning negotiations with the governments of each on terms for an early transition to effective independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The terrible occupation and killings in Vilnius in January put us all on notice of the dangers of complacency on this issue. It occurred, of course, while we were very much preoccupied with the events in the Gulf, and one of the matters that was of concern to me was that these events occurred at a time when international eyes were focused clearly on other issues. While relations with the Soviet Union have gradually thawed over the past few years, the struggle of the Baltic states went on largely unnoticed. The brutal events of January remind us that this struggle continues and that it should go on no longer unaided. </PARA>
<PARA> International support for the people of the Baltic states at this time is of the utmost importance. In the elections to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet in 1990, the nationalist movement won nearly 70 per cent of the seats. In March 1990, the new Lithuanian parliament declared unilateral independence from the Soviet Union. In April, the Soviet Union imposed economic sanctions against the republic. These were lifted later in July, when the Lithuanian Soviet suspended its independence declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> In March and April of 1990, respectively, Estonia and Latvia declared their independence. In early January 1991, Soviet paratroopers occupied a large number of public buildings in Lithuania and Latvia, and later, on 7 January, the Soviet defence ministry announced additional measures to enforce compulsory conscription in Lithuania. On 12 January, Soviet troops occupied a broadcasting centre in Vilnius, the capital of Latvia; shots were fired; at least 13 people were left dead and hundreds were wounded. The Soviet military seized a government building in Riga, Latvia's capital, killing four or five civilians and wounding nine. </PARA>
<PARA> These events serve to remind us that the price of independence is high. The coalition's view on this question of the annexation and occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union is that they were indefensible. Our position has been consistent and clear: the Soviet occupation is illegal and wrong; the Soviet Union must withdraw its forces from the Baltic states; it must concede them their independence. Following the referendum in Lithuania, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) reaffirmed that view. He called upon the Soviet Government to honour the results of the referendums and argued:</PARA>
<PARA>Western support and aid for the Soviet Union can continue only if minimum standards of human rights, including the right of peaceful self-determination, are observed. The Soviet Government should accept the referendum as a legitimate expression of the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>The final part of the motion is critical. It urges that the Australian Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . should join with other like-minded governments to press the Soviet Union to give early practical effect to these three referendums. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that the Government should be actively pursuing measures whereby it can demonstrate its active support for the independence of the Baltic people. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the Australian Government should take a lead in strongly pressing the Soviet Union both in its own right and in conjunction with other governments as well as in the United Nations and in other appropriate international forums to end its illegal occupation of the Baltic states and to restore their legitimate independence and sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> I must note that this is not the first occasion on which this House has been asked to consider resolutions dealing with the Baltic states. A little while ago, the former member for the seat of Menzies proposed to this House a motion dealing with the Baltic states; of course, as is the practice after motions have been dealt with, it has had to go back on the Notice Paper for possible discussion at another time. It is doubtful whether it will in fact be recalled, but it deplored the use of force against the citizens of each of the Baltic states, condemned the assault by Soviet troops and expressed the fact that people were appalled by the additional threat of force and demanded that the Soviet Union accept the principles of human rights and desist from the use of military force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that the motion debated on 21 February in this Parliament has not been carried. Resolutions have been passed in the Senate. I hope that the procedure whereby motions such as this are not brought on again for debate could be put aside to enable this motion, which lends support to the aspirations of the Baltic people, to be carried unanimously, as I am sure that would be the wish of all members of this House. I hope it is a matter that can be looked at and brought on for a positive vote at some convenient time. I urge support for this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion put forward by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). Like him, I also wish it were possible for the House to vote on some of the very important matters that come before it on Thursday mornings in private members' business. However, I am not confident that that will be the case this morning. That is no reflection on the importance all of us place on the motion put forward by the honourable member for Dundas. I think that whenever we consider the position of the Baltic states, we have to understand that they were free and independent sovereign nations between the First and Second World Wars and we have to ask why they do not have their freedom today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those three states do not have freedom today because in 1940 a secret agreement was made between Hitler and Joseph Stalin. That secret agreement was signed by von Ribbentrop and Molotov and allowed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to annex those three countries illegally and against all forms of international law. It is only when we understand that that we can appreciate why these three nations have such a strong claim for the restoration of their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of claims by other parts of the Soviet Union, such as the Ukraine and recently Georgia, which are arguing that they also should be given the right to secede from the Soviet Union if they wish. Whatever the justice of their claims, I think they are different from the claims of the three Baltic states. I have a great deal of sympathy for some of the claims made by the other states I just mentioned, but the Baltic states are different. The Baltic states are three countries annexed illegally because of that agreement between Hitler and Stalin-two of the greatest murderers who have ever walked the face of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an opportunity for the Baltic states to regain their independence because of the great breakthroughs made in the Soviet Union in recent years through perestroika and the Gorbachev reforms. That does not mean that Gorbachev looks as though he will be in a position to allow or to support the Baltic states to regain their independence, but I think all of us who support the rightful aims of the Baltic states for freedom must concede that without Gorbachev, the great gains they have made in recent years would not have taken place. It is because those reforms took place that many people in the Baltic states are able to demonstrate and express their views in their countries, whereas in the past, secret police and other forms of repression were used to stop them expressing their views. </PARA>
<PARA> As the previous speaker said, the first element in this motion calls upon the House to note the overwhelming votes that took place in Latvia and Estonia on 3 March and in Lithuania on 9 February this year in support of independence from the Soviet Union. In fact 90 per cent of Lithuanians backed secession from the Soviet Union and nearly three-quarters of the voters in Latvia and Estonia voted in favour of secession from the Soviet Union. That is a pretty overwhelming vote in any circumstances. We might look at the margins that are needed to elect a government in a country like Australia. If a proposal were to have the support of 90 per cent or more than 75 per cent of the people, the views of the population would be pretty clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be aware that Mr Gorbachev has proposed an alternative new mechanism for allowing member states of the Soviet Union to secede. Mr Gorbachev has proposed that if a member state were to have a resolution to secede carried by more than two-thirds of its population, that would trigger a process of negotiations between the national government of the Soviet Union and that member state. However, there will then be a transition period of up to five years in order to work out the details of the separation before it takes effect. Frankly, while I am pleased that Mr Gorbachev is at least facing up to the fact that member states have the right to secede from the Soviet Union, I believe that his proposal that it take up to five years-I understand that it also requires that the national government of the Soviet Union agree to the secession-places unreasonable conditions upon the people of the Baltic states who are seeking to determine their future. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly concerned that since the beginning of this year-in fact, from around the time these votes were taken-there has been an increase in the use of force by the national government of the Soviet Union to try to stop the growing strength of the independence movements in the Baltic states. The previous speaker went to some lengths to list in detail the acts of violence which have taken place in the three Baltic states since that time. I am sure many people in the gallery remember that the Soviet army stormed a television station in the capital of one of the Baltic states and a large number of people were beaten with batons and a number were shot. It was only because someone in the crowd happened to have a small video camera that the rest of the world was able to see with its own eyes the sort of violence used against people demonstrating for freedom in those states. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the leadership of the Soviet Union claims that repression was an independent act by the Soviet army commander in that region and not a direction from Moscow. However, given the command structure of the Soviet defence forces, I think we have every reason to be concerned that the Soviet leadership has not intervened more strongly to ensure that the people of the Baltic states have the right to elect the governments of their choice, to express their own views freely, to demand the independence they enjoyed until 1940 and also to remind the world that they would still have their independence but for the signatures of von Ribbentrop and Molotov in that evil alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> I know other people wish to speak on this motion, so I conclude by supporting the call made by the honourable member for Dundas-that all members of this House have an opportunity to vote on this motion, because I believe they would wish that it be carried unanimously. </PARA>

<PARA> For more than 50 years Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians have continued to demonstrate bravely and resolutely their desire and determination to regain the most basic of all rights and the most precious of all freedoms-national independence. Often at great cost, and always against seemingly insurmountable and impossible odds, the Baltic peoples have continued to resist Russian suppression of their cultural, social and religious heritage and traditions. </PARA>

Despite all these things, they have remained firm in their resolve. They have endeavoured to maintain the unequal struggle and their national loyalty has never wavered or diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> The cause of freedom has long been uppermost in the hearts and minds of these innocent and unwilling victims. Since August 1939 the restoration of independent, democratic, national states has remained their primary goal and sacred commitment. They know that freedom is worth fighting for. They know that it is worth waiting for. Perhaps that wait is now drawing, slowly and inevitably, to a close. The imposition by the Soviets of their will over the Baltic states and their peoples has been achieved by might, not right. That is why their control has never been absolute. That is why the flame of freedom, which was dimmed by the Nazis, could never be fully or finally extinguished by Soviet Russia. </PARA>
<PARA> The peoples of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania may have been denied their freedoms and human rights and they may have been stripped of their personal possessions; but in their hearts and minds they have always retained their national pride and dignity. Their national spirit has never been broken. Their souls have never been conquered. Their heads may have been bloodied but they are unbowed. They have remained strong and unyielding in their desire and determination to restore freedom and independence to their beloved homelands. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 I had the opportunity to visit Lithuania and to meet with many of its people. I have not only first hand experience of the natural beauty of this brave and magnificent country, but also a much better understanding of the suffering it has endured in the past and the problems and challenges that continue to confront its people. From a personal viewpoint, this visit certainly served to reinforce the advantages and privileges of living in a free and democratic country-advantages and privileges that many Australian citizens accept as a matter of course. Perhaps only those who have had their freedom taken away, their individual and national rights defiled or denied, can truly appreciate and understand how precious such blessings are, and how vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever we act to support or protect others whose rights are threatened by unrelenting and unjustifiable acts of naked aggression, as in the recent Gulf conflict, or continuing oppression, as in the case of the Baltic states, we signify to the world, and reinforce to ourselves, that we are prepared to recognise and accept our responsibilities as members of the international community; that we are ready to stand firm against any attempt by one nation to impose its will-by force, coercion or corruption-on another. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, these brave nations deserve our sympathy. More importantly, their struggle to preserve their national identity and regain their national independence deserves our support. Perhaps we can make only relatively small gestures. From a practical viewpoint, our contribution to the restoration of self-determination and freedom in and for the Baltic states may be quite limited. But taking small, limited and perhaps seemingly insignificant actions is infinitely better than taking no action at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The voice of Australia, added to the voices of other free and democratic nations throughout the world, may result in a chorus that can no longer be ignored. I urge honourable members on both sides of this House to adopt a bipartisan attitude to this issue-as we have done on previous occasions in regard to similar significant issues-and indicate our continuing support for, and unequivocal commitment to, the cause of independence and freedom and the right of self-determination for the people of the beleaguered Baltic states. I commend their cause and this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to agree with this motion. It notes overwhelming support for the three Baltic states voting in favour of independence from the Soviet Union. I agree with that. It calls on the Government of the Soviet Union to respect the results of these referendums. I think it should. It demands that the Government of the Soviet Union renounce the use of force in its dealings with these Baltic states. I think it would be a mighty step forward for progress if that were to happen. It believes that the Australian Government should join with other governments to press the Soviet Union to bring into effect the results of these referendums. I not only agree with that but have also urged it on this Government in private letters. The Government has, for the most part, undertaken actions to press on the Soviet Union that it no longer repress the people of the Baltic states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I believe has been going on in the Soviet Union since the mid-1980s is the dissolution of the last great colonial European-based empire. That took place in its Third World possessions because it could no longer afford to support its outposts in Africa, Central America and Indo-China. It withdrew from eastern Europe, after trying to organise some reforms there, because of the overwhelming cost of repression and occupation. It is now confronted with the choice of either maintaining by repression the Soviet state and its constituent repressed republics or of dissolving itself. I believe it should dissolve itself, either voluntarily or with encouragement from domestic revolt and outside assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Yeltsin is already arguing that essentially the Russian Federation should go its own way. Many other states have already suggested that they want to become independent, including the three Baltic states, as noted in this motion; also over the past week Georgia has voted in a similar direction. I am sure that, given the opportunity, the Ukraine would do the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Gorbachev, who came into power in 1985 with the apparent historic mission of bringing about the dissolution of this empire, went bad last year. He went bad, having got out of the Third World possessions and the eastern European states, the people's democracies. He has now decided to retain the core of the Soviet empire by repression. I became aware of the fact that he had gone bad by reading the newspapers, by talking to people who had visited the Soviet Union, by talking to delegations that visited my office from the Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Lithuania during last year, and by talking to constituents who come from that part of the world and regularly communicate with their families who are still there. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to Gorbachev-I will not read out the letter-and essentially I said, `You've gone bad on us, mate. Are you going to come good or are we going to have to get into you?'. I think the answer is that he has gone bad, he has stayed bad, and it is time to get into him. He is getting worse. This morning's newspapers report that he is calling for a state of emergency. A new crackdown is being fixed up in Lithuania. Georgia looks as though it is going to get a dose of the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate situation is that, as a country, the historic time for Australia to have recognised the independence of the Baltic states, particularly Lithuania, was in November and December of last year and January of this year. It is an unfortunate fact of international politics that at the time when elected politicians from Lithuania-notably Prunskiene-visited this country seeking recognition, we had to get Soviet assistance to cobble together, under United Nations auspices, the coalition that liberated Kuwait, an important strategic area, an area of principle and national self-determination. This coalition would otherwise have been denied to us if the Soviet Union had decided to organise against us in the United Nations. That would have been another tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am of the view that we should have recognised Lithuania and that we should be shaping up to recognise Lithuania in the near future. It is a nation with definable boundaries and with a state apparatus which, unfortunately, is not in control of itself only because of Soviet occupation, which should cease forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with this thought: I understand why the Government finds it difficult to organise recognition. It finds it difficult, in the circumstances of last December and January, because of the Gulf imperatives. It finds it difficult now because of the need to deal on a Western united front against the Soviet empire in order to encourage it in directions that are advantageous to the West and the world community and to get it to desist from nasty activities. I understand this, but I cannot understand for the life of me why the Opposition does not call for it. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in view of the reliance of Australia on the petrol driven car and the consequences of this reliance for energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, the viability of public transport and the costly infrastructure of low density cities, this House supports the observance of a Car-Free Day for Australia which, recalling that the first Holden was manufactured on 29 November 1948, should be held on 29 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me explain that the car free day is not an anti-car day; it is an opportunity for people to participate and to think about the way we built Australian cities, and the costs of having built Australian cities at very low densities, whereby they can be serviced only by the private motor vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there are 17 million Australians in this country, there are about nine million private motor cars. That does not count the buses and trucks and so on. What I am saying is that we have made a significant investment in the private motor vehicle, but that we do not realise some of the costs in terms of congestion and the lengthening journeys to work, or journeys to do any of the other things that we would normally do, and that at some stage we have to pause and look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his now famous statement of July 1989 entitled Our Country, Our Future noted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's objective is to seek the co-operation of State Governments to reduce transport energy consumption per capita by encouraging an integrated approach to public transport development and land use planning. </PARA>
<PARA>What I am seeking by designating a particular day as a car free day-when, I would hope, people would not take their cars to work but would take the train or the bus or cycle or walk, or maybe have three or four people share a car or whatever-is really to have an opportunity to pause and think about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said to me, `What happens if it is successful and everyone lines up down at the railway station at 7 o'clock, and we cannot fit everyone on the train?'. That could be an embarrassment, and it would give the wrong impression, because people might then say, `Well, hang on, the trains are no good; I am going straight back to my car'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want that sort of negative debate to occur. The nub of my argument is as follows. We cannot make public transport pay in low density cities. It does not matter how efficiently the system is run or how low the fares are; if it is not convenient to travel by public transport, then we will not use it. We have to think about where we locate people, and in what densities we locate them. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently visited the city of Toronto in Canada, where, 20 years ago, it was really decided that an attempt would be made to shift people out of cars, particularly for commuting, and onto the rail system. The beauty of it is that it was realised that a contract had to be made, in a sense, between two groups of people. The state government, which owned the rail system, would go to the municipal government, which was responsible for city planning, and say, `If you want the next railway, then you have to guarantee us that there will be sufficient numbers of people going through the turnstiles'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never heard of that sort of contract being made in Australia. What we tend to do here is to wait for a political outcry by some people in the outer suburbs, saying, `We want the next train station to be here. It does not matter how many people live here, or how many are or are not going to commute, we want the next railway station, even if it loses millions of dollars a year in servicing that station'. That is not good enough. There has to be a trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Toronto situation the trade-off is, `If you want a train station, give us a look at your town plan. What density is there? How close will you locate people to that railway station? How many people will be located close to that railway station? Are they commuters? Are they potential users of the line?'. It is that sort of trade-off that I think we as politicians-Federal, State and local-have to begin to think about, because there are no other solutions. It does not matter how much funding we put into trains or what tax write-offs we give to public transport, or how much we shift the cost of petrol up: those things are not all that relevant; it is just pushing the costs around amongst the population. </PARA>
<PARA> Until there are sufficient people living near existing urban public transport infrastructure, not enough people will ever use it and we will never be able to get a shift in people away from the private motor vehicle and onto trains, buses or other forms of transport. That is the only point I seek to make through this symbolic gesture, if you like, of the car free day. It is an attempt to get people to think about the seriousness of these questions. In Brisbane, in my area, a recent study has been carried out on transport usage, commuting and so on. As usual, the transport planners are saying, `We need six or seven new freeways, six or seven new bridges, across the Brisbane River'. All the people who live in the inner suburbs and may be affected by these freeways say, `No, we cannot have it, not in my backyard'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough to say no. In a sense we are all a bit anti-freeway. We do not like carving up places and ripping down existing residences. I say to the inner city residents: if we are to service fairly all the people who live in the city of Brisbane, there has to be a trade-off. The inner city, as well as the outer suburbs, will have to locate more people near existing railway lines. It is not fair to say, `I do not want the freeway', and bury one's head in the sand. We have to ask the inner city people to give up something too. They do not want the outer city people to be well serviced-it is too much to ask. The inner city people will have to rearrange their living to some extent so that, in this case, there is higher density living around existing train stations and people can get out of cars and onto the urban rail network. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we make that trade-off, it is not fair for one group to say, `We do not want the freeways and we do not want the bridges over the river'. Similarly, let us say that a railway station is built at a very distant outer suburb in Brisbane. It may be built because of political pressure. I believe that a sensible State Minister for transport-we have one, of course-would ask the following question of those city planners, `Will sufficient people use this railway station before I spend $2m, $3m, $4m or $5m to put in the new line and station?'. We do not tend to ask that question. We tend to react to pressure and say, `The mob out in the outer suburbs want an extra train line; we had better put it in. After all, they have rights to the services which are available to those in the inner suburbs'. They have rights, but I do not believe that the transport Minister and the broad population have to make a loss on that train station year in year out because not many people live out there. </PARA>
<PARA> There have to be enough people living around the new railway station in order to be reasonably sure that it is convenient to get on the train. Rail networks and rail departments have to be a bit more entrepreneurial. For instance, it is common now for many women on their journey to work to drop their children off somewhere on that journey, put them in a day care centre and travel on-usually by car. If child minding centres were located at the railway station, then it would be more convenient to drop the children off at the day care centre, get on the train and commute in. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to start to look at the things that people do every day, where they are located and what sorts of activities they undertake during the day with the use of public transport. There should be a bit of creative thinking as to how people live and how they want to travel. This should be brought to the attention of local governments, State government planners and the Federal Government to the extent that they have a view. We might then start to rebalance Australian cities and get a few more people moving in public transport modes and not carry this huge burden of nine million private cars in an Australian society of 17 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is a greenie! It is hard to distinguish between members of the Australian Labor Party and greenies. Never mind, I will give him the benefit of the doubt. We will now forget about the greenhouse effect. I am a very practical person. I have spent most of my life in the petroleum industry. As I listened to the honourable member I thought to myself, `Those poor suffering motorists of Australia today. Even if they drive Fiats, Holdens or BMWs, they are all being taken to the cleaners with the price of petrol'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other day I heard the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean)-they say he was a great man with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-talk about the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The PSA has had a long time to sort out the petroleum industry but it has never been successful because the petroleum industry is an absolute mire. The PSA has found it very difficult to control because of the power of the oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to the motion. Most people use their motor vehicles. I do not like talking about myself, but when I was the warden of Clarence when the Tasman Bridge went down, I noticed something very interesting. Because of necessity most people caught a ferry across the river. They could not drive motor vehicles across the bridge because it was broken. After the bridge was reconstructed the ferries went out of business. Bob Clifford has gone into the Sea Cats. The ferries went out of business because no-one rode on them; people all went back to their motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in the petroleum industry for about 15 years of my good life. I still have the indentation of the overalls on my back and the grease in my nails. That is more than I can say for some of the Labor members. They do not know what hard work is all about. They do not know what looking after the working people is all about either. I observed people very closely. I found that many motorists-male in particular-got their sexual motivation from their motor vehicles. They would change dramatically once they got into their motor vehicles. They would leave their wives and children in a distressed state. Some would not even clothe their children. But their motor vehicles were lovely and clean and these men spent most of their money on motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is this: people love their motor vehicles and they cannot do without them. The honourable member for Petrie can say and do what he likes, but I am afraid that the motor vehicle has become the creature of mankind. It has become a lethal weapon. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is a good gesture, but I cannot get the petroleum industry out of my brain. Most of my speeches, if they have not been about Tasmania, have been about the petroleum industry. I know how much it has cost the Australian public and I know that many consumers have been taken to the cleaners because of petroleum. People depend on motor vehicles. There are 10 million people with motor vehicles and most of them want them. When people get behind the wheel of their motor vehicles they change dramatically. It is not a bad gesture to want to stop the pollution. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has bought a new motor vehicle. Is it a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) driven vehicle or is it a petrol driven vehicle?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that not hypocritical? Petrol is a pollutant but LPG is not. Many of my speeches in the early days were about LPG driven vehicles. I said that we would go to import parity and that we would all accept that, but regrettably we did not look for the alternatives. If we had looked for LPG driven vehicles we would not have problems today with the supply of petrol. We have an abundance of LPG. I think that Toyota produced an LPG driven vehicle but it produced only a car driven by LPG, not the dual system so that the motor could also be turned over to petrol. That was a fizzer. We had alternatives for gearboxes, diffs, headlights, upholstery and goodness knows what, but there were no alternatives for LPG. The Environment Minister says that she is doing the right thing, but by having a petrol driven vehicle is she conserving and protecting the environment? Of course she is not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> But back to petrol: I remember the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he was the Opposition spokesman on Treasury. Tasmania has 250,000 motor vehicles which means that more than half the population has one. We are a small State dependent on motor vehicles for getting from point A to point B, unlike Canberra which has a lovely system of public transport. That is what the honourable member for Petrie was talking about. If all the roads in Australia were like those in Canberra, if public transport in Tasmania was like that in Canberra, it would not be so bad. But we have not got that road system. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking about the Treasurer. When he was the spokesman, he talked about taxation by stealth at the petrol pump. Do honourable members recall that? He said that one of the reasons that the Labor Party would get into government was that it would reduce the price of petrol. What did it do? It got caught up in the process of getting easy taxation to promote some of its harebrained ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> Petrol is with us to stay. We are not looking for the alternatives that we should. They are talking about an electric motor vehicle now. They are talking about other developments on the horizon which are very good because they would reduce the pollution that gets into our atmosphere. It will not reduce the number of cars on the road. Cars will always be there. People will not go to public transport because, I repeat, they love their motor vehicles and they want to stay with their motor vehicles. What we have to do is organise people to be better controlled when they get behind the wheels of their motor vehicles so that we can have a safer environment, safer roads and not so much of the distress that is caused by accidents which occur every day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) in his motion for a car-free day. Unlike the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), I am not too concerned about motorphiles and the Tasman Bridge in the 1970s when that unfortunate accident occurred. Since that bridge collapsed, all across Australia there has been a different perception of the need for motor transport and our reliance on motor transport. I might say that in other parts of Australia, perhaps not in the honourable member's area of Franklin or in the honourable member himself, there has been a change of thinking and a realisation that there needs to be some change-not just of thinking, but of action-with regard to motor transport and the way we perceive it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly during this century, our reliance on petrol or fossil-fuel-derived fuel for transport in Australia has developed as part of the culture of this country-and the honourable member for Franklin did allude to that. Indeed, during the last 50 years or so, it has evolved alongside other societal standards such as the family home, and perhaps the Hills hoist. The family car has been considered as part of our independence and our freedom. For those who can afford the outlay and the running costs, it is considered not as a luxury, but as a necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the liberty and the equity that the family car provides is not without some cost. The car has enabled Australians to express and enjoy a free spirit, but that free spirit is also somewhat of a millstone to society and the generations that it was supposed to emancipate. Indeed, present generations, notably the younger generation, are certainly looking at the reliance on motor transport in the same way as our grandparents or forebears no doubt started to see the horse-drawn transport that the honourable member for Franklin alluded to. No doubt they looked upon horse-drawn transport in those days in the same way that future generations and present generations look upon motor transport-that is, it is very smelly and somewhat inefficient.</PARA>
<PARA> What the younger generation and we, as custodians of the planet for the next generation, must consider is the impact of this reliance on the planet that we will be handing on to future generations. The need to reduce the domination of the car as a form of transport needs to be ingrained in the minds of not just the users but also the leaders of government and institutions so that they will move more towards public transport and will design infrastructure with efficient public transport in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the reasons for the need to change our thinking and the effects of our present tardiness in making adjustments to our actions are evident to some, but ignored or lost on too many. Indeed, papers presented in October 1989 at the Prime Minister's Science Council meeting with the reference `Global Climatic Change-Issues for Australia', illustrate the position the motor car has claimed in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. As well, they illustrate that the motor car has lessened the viability of public transport or, more often, has led to its absence altogether. It has certainly increased the costly infrastructure of low density cities, as the honourable member for Petrie mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not about to rant against greenhouse gases per se. After all, I acknowledge that without some presence of these gases in the atmosphere, the temperature of the atmosphere would be something like minus 20 degrees Celsius-a little bit like Canberra on a cool day. It is accepted that the naturally occurring greenhouse gases are increasing and the consequences can be catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA> The car-free day directs our attention to one of the contributors to that particular problem. The greenhouse gases and their contribution to global warming are illustrated in the papers that were presented to the Prime Minister's Science Council. Indeed, all of the CO2 emitted from Australian industrial areas or man-made sources come from our production of energy. Oil represents a significant proportion of this. Indeed, oil for transport, in particular, is the most inefficient converter of a fuel source, with an efficiency rate of less than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1985, Australia has only marginally improved its energy use while most major countries have made much greater gains. With the urban designs with low density populations that we have and the provided infrastructure which is contributing to petrol consumption and some change in our thinking with regard to city designs and expectations, this problem will continue and will not be addressed. It is not inconceivable that at some future date, with petroleum stocks exhausted, families will have to make do without the private car. Consequently I support the member for Petrie. </PARA>

<PARA> In talking about a no-car day, the honourable member talked about urban infrastructure. I will quote what was said by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), as reported in an excellent article by Margo Kingston. After coming out of a Cabinet meeting, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a massive step forward. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement was made in the context of urban infrastructure and the changes that need to be made in our cities which sprawl too much. On a serious note, there is a great need for changes to be made so we can effect a better lifestyle for those people who have to have a car to take their kids down the street because not only are there no roads that are safe to drive on there are not even footpaths for women to push their prams along because the house only has one car. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) spoke about the cost of petrol. What the Government is doing is rationing petrol by the prices it puts on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement is very interesting because he clearly presents what needs to be done. In Margo Kingston's article he said that Ministers had:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . agreed on the development of strategic initiatives and measures in respect of improved intergovernmental coordination, improved planning mechanisms, enhanced efficiency of infrastructure provision, facilitation of private investment in infrastructure and higher density housing, and innovative approaches to the achievement of higher urban densities. </PARA>
<PARA>Now how is that? Is that as clear as mud?</PARA>
<PARA> There are at least two explanations for this gobbledegook. This Government has failed-and it is not just this Government, but some of the State Labor governments. There is that marvellous person, Tom Roper, helping with Victoria's transport situation. Now Victoria is up to a $1.2 billion public deficit for this year. It is going so well. I put it on the record that Victoria is 64 per cent behind other States. But in the past six years alone Victoria's public transport losses have amounted to almost $5.5 billion or roughly $5,000 for every family in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The shame about the press release by the honourable member for Petrie that appeared in the Age is that in it he had to have a go at the General Motors-Holden's company. I have got to tell the honourable member what General Motors-Holden's has done for us in Victoria. I do not know what has happened in Adelaide and other places, but it created whole suburbs and it created those suburbs around places where there are rail stops. It actually was a successful program. General Motors-Holden's has been a model Australian company and, for my area, very, very important. I would hold it up as an example. </PARA>
<PARA> Moree and Bendigo are the best hope for the future. We do not want people to stay in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Adelaide any more; we want them to go to Moree or Bendigo to live. Just pack up traps and move out. Let us go to Moree and Bendigo. Those are the places of the future. Forget about Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the unintended consequences-and this is the serious part of what the honourable member was saying-if this car-free day goes ahead? Last year we lost more than 60 million working days on average, that is, eight days for each employed person. What would happen in Victoria is that we would double that in one day because people in Victoria would take a day off if they could not take the car. That would be an acceptable excuse. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say to the honourable member that there are a few things that have to be taken into account with respect to the greenhouse effect. I refer, for instance,  to cattle, and the flatulence of those  cattle--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Sir Winston Churchill once described our representative system of democracy as the worst we know of, but for all the rest. That is not a strictly accurate and full quote, but I paraphrase it in that way because it serves my purpose. It is a very interesting way of talking, and I often use that quote when I go to high schools to try to explain the benefits of our Westminster representative system of democracy as practiced here in Australia. I say to the high school students, `Just think about it for a minute-the worst, but for all the rest'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What Churchill was really saying all those years ago was that at any time our current system of government has its faults and we can have our complaints and criticisms about it. But the interesting thing, since the evolution of human political thought and personal and social experience, is that there is no better system of government known to man, notwithstanding its faults. It is the worst we know of, but for all the rest. As human societies have tried down the ages to govern themselves in a way that is fair, reasonable and just for their citizens, there is no better system than the representative Westminster system as we practice it in Australia, originally borrowed from the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of its faults may be that it basically works on a majority rule system. We have to be very careful about what is known as the tyranny of the majority. It is quite feasible that an individual in a body politic like Australia could live his or her whole life in the minority. An individual may never feel that he or she is adequately represented by our system. I am sure that today in our community there are people who feel that. </PARA>
<PARA> One complaint might be that we elect a government and it is three years-four in the States-before we can get a chance to change our mind, or at least make a judgment on its performance. There is already a substantial body of political argument in Australia that one of the ways we might cope with that particular inflexibility of the system and make it more representative more often is to graft on to it a system of citizen initiated referenda. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, one of the complaints that I have heard about our system relates to political advertising. The Government has foreshadowed that it is going to introduce legislation into both the Senate and the House of Representatives to ban political advertising on television and radio. I am also led to believe, as I examine this issue, that there is some community support for this Government proposal. In one sense, I can understand why there would be some community support for banning political advertising on radio and television. As a class, and as a vocation, politicians are not held in particularly high esteem, although, at an individual level, I certainly have no complaints about the public's treatment of me. I am sure that my colleagues opposite would agree that as a class the perception is that we are all robbers, crooks, cheats and liars-but not my local member, whoever he or she may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I can also understand that there may be some support for this ban on political advertising on radio and television because of the community's dislike of advertisements generally. In my dozen years in public life, I have heard criticisms and complaints, not only about the standard of television and the standard of radio, both commercially and publicly owned and operated, but also about the standard of advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make an appeal in my short remarks today to those in our community who may have some feelings along these lines to try to look at the wider and more fundamental issue. This proposal, if it goes ahead, if it comes into this Parliament at all by way of a Bill, strikes very directly and threateningly at one of the fundamental tenets of our Westminster representative system, that is, of course, free speech and the political freedom to be able to express one's political view when, where and how one would like to. </PARA>
<PARA> Another great political philosopher once said that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. The impending debate on this issue, because there is a crescendo building up on the issue, falls very squarely within that framework. This is a fundamental assault on Australians' democratic freedoms to say what they like, when they like and how they like on political issues in the context of a political election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, if someone had said to me a few months ago that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government was going to move in this direction, I would have dismissed and discounted it. A party that often cites in this place its great traditions to try to bring democracy and freedom to the working classes of the world under the oppressive yolk of capitalism has now come so far that it is seriously proposing that we ban political advertising from television and radio. I could not have believed it, but I am now forced to believe it. I want to place on record, in advance of the substantive debate, my absolute opposition and outrage to this proposal-let alone legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to hear sophistry from the other side about how this proposal is justified in terms of trying to root out corruption. That is akin to saying to a man who illegally gains finance with which to buy a motor car, `The way we will cope with this is to ban motor cars'. It is ridiculous. One is not going to root out political corruption by banning the possibility of expending political moneys in one direction only. If one wants to root out political corruption, there are other, more substantive ways to do it. The ridiculous plan of banning one medium, radio and television-not print advertisements and not direct mail-just highlights the real motivation behind this Government proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, it relates to the fact that the ALP, broadly speaking, around Australia is broke. Apart from Queensland, and probably Tasmania, where its political stocks are a little higher than in other States, the ALP is in a very poor position indeed. It is going to lose the next New South Wales State election and it is short of political and financial support because voters not only are not going to vote for it, but also are not going to donate money to it. With the appalling situation in Victoria and South Australia, and my own State of Western Australia, the ALP is really on its uppers in terms of a political organisation. So some great democrat within the Labor Party has come up with this proposal to ban political advertising on radio and television so that it may be able to get out of its financial and political jam; thereby it would not have to spend that money because it would be illegal to spend it anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> To all those in the community who may have some empathy for this view, let me also say that it will not apply just to political parties. It will affect the school teachers union, the Australian Farmers Federation, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Royal Australian Nursing Federation, the local mothers' club at the kindergarten-any community organisation will be forbidden from expressing a political point of view on radio and television. Quite frankly, this will not be the last time that I come into this chamber to speak on this issue. I am appalled and outraged and I raise it today as a matter of grievance because, hopefully, the proposal can be scuttled before it even comes into this chamber by way of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can I allow this charge to go unchallenged? It is not the case that the proposal that has been put forward infringes on freedom of speech. No-one in Australia will be stopped from speaking. It is not the case that the freedom of the press is being interfered with by such a proposal; it is not true. There is no such thing as a right to advertise. We do not allow cigarette companies to do it. I think the former shadow health Minister, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), would support the view that it is appropriate that the Government legislates in that way. The real issue that needs to be addressed is what price we should pay for democracy. Will the Opposition support public funding of elections and public disclosure? When the Opposition is willing to do those things, then it will be in a position in which its claims will have some validity. But the unctuous cries of it at the moment do not carry any weight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the grievance debate today there are two issues which I wish to raise. The first is one that has come to my attention via a number of constituents. I think it just reflects the tip of the iceberg, but it is a concern to those in Australia who have relatives overseas or other people who wish to come here to visit them. I refer to the large number of people who have applied for visitors visas and who have been rejected. During the last six months I have had in my office at least a dozen cases of people who applied to come to Australia and who were rejected, very often for very value-laden reasons. These judgments had been made overseas by officials of our Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. There are implications of this in terms of the personal distress caused to the people overseas and in terms of the image of Australia that is presented to those applying for temporary entry to visit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also implications for tourism. We know of the parlous state of Qantas Airways Ltd at the moment. Had the 65,000 people who applied to come to Australia as visitors but who were rejected been allowed to come here, that would have increased substantially the load for international carriers to this country and, I imagine, increased substantially our domestic economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that there are many cases where the criteria for tourist visas are not fulfilled. There is a requirement that these people have a return ticket and be able to substantiate that they have sufficient cash for their holiday or time in Australia. There are requirements which clearly need to be fulfilled. But in the many cases that I have seen-this applies particularly to applications from the Indian subcontinent and Asia-I have found that value judgments have been made about people who have previously applied to come to Australia for permanent residency but have been rejected. Why should their applications to come to Australia as a visitor, and to spend some time here as a tourist or to visit relatives, automatically be rejected? The reason, I understand, is that there is concern that these people may overstay. But there needs to be a balancing of that view against all of the circumstances that exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In a number of the cases brought to my attention, following representations by my staff and me these people have subsequently been allowed to come because the evidence has overwhelmingly shown that they had legitimately lodged applications to come to Australia and, indeed, that they should have been successful. I understand there are posts where the percentage of people on visitors visas who overstay in Australia is higher than others. I understand that Rangoon and places in the subcontinent reflect that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to look at a number of the cases that I have seen of people who wished to come to Australia to visit their relatives. Their relatives had indicated that they were willing to have them and to make sure that they complied with the regulations. In some cases, members of the same family had previously visited Australia and complied with the regulations; there was no record of breaking the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst case that I saw was of a honeymoon couple who applied to come to Australia but who were rejected on the grounds that they might want to stay. I can understand that concern in respect of single people, but in that particular case it seemed clear that the judgment that had been made overseas was incorrect. Fortunately, that situation was resurrected in time for them to enjoy their honeymoon. But it is something that is of concern. It has tourism implications; it has implications for Qantas and certainly for Australia's image overseas. I understand the difficulty that overseas officers operate under, but it is clear to me that we need to consider very importantly the way in which those judgments are made. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue that I wanted to mention was the summary of the major findings of the Australian workplace industrial relations survey which has recently been released. It represents the most comprehensive survey of industrial relations and practices in this country. It takes into account the activities of unions, management and industrial tribunals and it questions many of the stereotypes that have existed previously about industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, considering the changes that are taking place in the workplace in this country at this time, and which certainly took place during the 1980s, that we have a better understanding of what is actually happening in the workplace, because it is individual workplaces that are actually productive. When we look at the macro issues, sometimes we tend to lose sight of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey took in more than 2,000 workplaces in this country. Over two years, more than 4,500 managers and workplaces were the subject of investigation by those involved in the survey. Indeed, an individual workplace, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is a single physical area occupied by an establishment, from which it engages in productive activity on a relatively permanent basis. Therefore, if that definition is used, this is a substantial piece of research. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at many of the myths that exist in popular conception and how those have been broken down by the results of this survey. For instance, the popular view is that industrial disputes are widespread in Australian workplaces, but the survey shows that 72 per cent of workplaces have never had any industrial action. The popular myth is that most Australian workplaces are unionised, but it is the case that 57 per cent of workplaces have no union members-and that is something that most people would not understand. The popular conception is that most unionised workplaces have many unions, but fewer than 2 per cent of workplaces have more than five unions. So it is the case that many of the myths that have been perpetuated are not true.</PARA>
<PARA> Another popular conception is that unions are quite active in workplaces in Australia, but it is interesting to note that at most workplaces delegates spend one hour or less on union work. Indeed, there are no delegates at 34 per cent of unionised workplaces. The other popular belief, of course, is that there has been very little change in the workplace in Australia. It is interesting to note that 86 per cent of workplaces had undergone major organisational change in the last two years. It is the case that award restructuring and workplace reform is going on, and it is going on apace. </PARA>
<PARA> What is perhaps more interesting for honourable members opposite is that the popular view amongst managers-and I mentioned that more than 4,000 managers were interviewed in this survey-is that industrial relations is the major efficiency barrier to managers. But the view that managers put in this survey was that financial and capital constraints were the major barriers. So it is very interesting to look at some of those myths and to see them exploded. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has many implications, but I think there are some that are important. In the one minute remaining to me I will try to mention a couple of them. The first is that it is clear from this report that communication between management and workers is lacking and there is a clear need for an increase in that communication. In fact, managers said that they felt that they lacked skills in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that there is no infrastructure for enterprise bargaining in the workplace in Australia at the moment. This, of course, has very clear implications for our opponents' industrial relations philosophy, because there is no enterprise infrastructure in place. If one were to go along the route that they are predicting or anticipating, one would find that, until the infrastructure is built, that is an impossible goal. What we are trying to do in this country is to develop a cooperative model of workplace reform, one in which award restructuring and workplace change take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this House the position of a group in our society who make an enormous contribution to the economic, social and political fabric of our society; a group who, at present, are bearing an enormous responsibility in these times of recession, but whose efforts-and they are often described as the quiet achievers-have been largely overlooked, certainly by this Government and often by many in our society. I refer to rural women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost 2 1/2 million Australian women live outside urban centres. About half of them live on farms; over three-quarters of them have limited educational qualifications. These women are largely absent from studies of rural issues, decision making, and the popular image of agriculture. They have always played a major role in rural work, but their contribution is more visible in times of drought and recession, when their expanded tasks are, to some degree, acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, one-third of Australian farmers are women. In 1970, 2,000 of Australia's 250,000 rural holdings were run by women; in 1988, the figure was 5,400. While the rural population has declined, the proportion of women involved in farming has increased. Forty years ago there were 23 men for every woman formally employed in agriculture; today, 30 per cent of paid rural workers are women. There is an increasing number of women who manage their own farms. In 1986 the National Farmers magazine estimated that women contribute approximately $6 billion to the rural economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland University survey entitled `Lives of Rural Women-Problems and Prospects for Employment', found that many rural women have workloads equivalent to two or three full-time jobs, but are often described as not having a job. Whilst most of the men earned the bulk of income, many families and their farms would not have survived without the contribution from rural women. These women contribute significantly to family farms by working without pay, sometimes as a substitute for hired labour. They often combine all this with paid employment to supplement the family income. Seventeen per cent of women in rural Australia have off-farm employment as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural woman has many roles. Her main task is as wife and mother. In the survey on women in rural Australia, 53 per cent responded that their occupation was home duties only, despite clear evidence that an enormous range of voluntary community work is undertaken. Similarly, the work on the farm is often regarded as part of their home duties. Her domestic responsibilities include cleaning, washing, cooking for the family and farm workers, tending gardens, preserving produce, caring for young animals, keeping poultry, milking a house cow, processing dairy products, making family clothes, mowing, gardening, cleaning the car and the farm ute, shopping for the family and farm, educating children in remote areas, and transporting for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> In rural areas facilities for the care of older people and the disabled are less available than in large metropolitan areas. There are fewer of the backup services available. Rural women are often called upon to care for these dependants in their homes, along with all the other tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1981 National Farmers survey, two-thirds of women who responded said that they took care of the bookkeeping and the bills. This involved keeping records of stock breeding and crop production, as well as paying bills, answering the phone and doing business with bank managers, solicitors and other professional people. </PARA>
<PARA> Between looking after her family and working on the farm, as well as perhaps a paid job in town in her spare time, traditionally the rural woman is expected to carry out voluntary work for the school, church and community. A characteristic of rural life is the high level of community involvement. Much of this outlet for rural women has been curtailed as they have been forced to do more physical outside work on the farm because of the recession and loss of hired labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The withdrawal of volunteers means voluntary services are carried out by fewer women, who try to maintain facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, day care centres, rape and crisis centres, school children's hostels, buses, sporting ventures, et cetera. Many of these facilities are drying up through lack of unpaid help. Consequently, gaps are developing in community services which are not being filled. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Lees, of the Rural Development Centre at the University of New England, suggested that one of the reasons for increased hardship and suffering in the rural community is the withdrawal and collapse of many volunteer networks. The volunteers are too busy trying to survive themselves and can no longer provide such services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Financial Review of 10 January 1989 when discussing a Federal report Life Has Never Been Easy it was stressed that rural women have consistently been deprived equal access to the education and training, social support and the counselling freely available to their city counterparts due to geographical isolation. It is difficult for country women to improve their levels of skills. There is little opportunity for employment in the country, particularly for young girls. Many leave, seeking opportunities in the city or larger country centres. </PARA>
<PARA> However, rural women face barriers job-seeking because the number and range of jobs available in the country is limited. Even in the larger rural centres employment opportunities are particularly scarce in semi-professional and technical areas. Upgrading or gaining new skills is not always possible because of distance from educational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This position has been exacerbated by the rural recession. Opportunities have contracted as the impact of uncertain economic conditions prevailing in the local farm economy are felt by local businesses. There is a great need to overcome barriers with regard to rural women's educational opportunities, in providing access and breaking down community attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport and communication are important aspects in the quality of life for rural women in Australia. In a survey where women were asked to indicate their preference for Government spending, 69 per cent indicated that roads should be a priority. This is understandable when it is by road that the rural population gains access to education, health and other community services. </PARA>
<PARA> As more women are taking more responsibilities on farms, as well as doing more and more work, they are slowly gaining representation in rural organisations. With years of experience on the land and in community affairs, country women feel they are qualified to take on roles which will give them not only a say in the decisions that will affect the farm and rural community, but also a sense of achievement that they have this greater voice. Many women are now realising that they can have a greater voice in the matters that concern them, their families and their livelihoods by getting involved in the public side of farming. </PARA>
<PARA> The tradition of rural women to help out, to simply use commonsense to solve problems, to patiently always be there in times of crisis, to lend a helping hand is being tested in these times as never before. But just like rural women in the past times of crisis, rural women of the 1990s are showing the same determination, initiative and strength of character. A rural women's information network has been set up in rural New South Wales. Farm gate learning programs in my area of north-eastern Victoria have also been set up. </PARA>
<PARA> In his address to the National Press Club in February this year, Brian Loton said:</PARA>
<PARA>We wish to become a nation in which people consistently perform to the very best of their abilities, where all resources-human and otherwise-are employed to the full. </PARA>
<PARA>Rural women are already achieving this, but with little recognition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise with a mixture of fond memories and real concern. I have fond memories because I am going to talk about a school in my electorate called Mount Carmel College where my daughter Zina spent three very happy years. I have concern because unfortunately these fond memories are very much overshadowed by current events; and that is the threatened closure of Mount Carmel College by the Queensland Catholic Education Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mount Carmel is a Catholic College for Girls established in 1957 in the bayside suburb of Wynnum. It is the only college of this type in my electorate and thus consequently fills a special place in local history, a place that many people in my electorate do not wish to see erased. </PARA>
<PARA> Mount Carmel College is an important part of both Wynnum and the wider bayside community and plays a vital role in broadening the range of choices in education for students and parents in these areas. I know that when my wife, Tina, and I looked around for a school to which to send our daughter during the formative years of her secondary education, we were extremely pleased to have a school such as Mount Carmel so close at hand. That is why I was so shocked and disappointed to hear recently that the Queensland Catholic Education Office is proposing to close down the school from the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I attended a protest meeting staged by the Mount Carmel Action Committee, listened to its arguments, and saw first hand that the students of Mount Carmel College certainly do not want their school to be closed. I was given the justification supplied by the Catholic Education Office as to the reasons for the closure and spent a great deal of time going over both sides of the argument. I suppose what surprised me the most was that there was no consultation, no forewarning of the closure. If there were some problems with the school, then surely the local community had the right to know what these problems were and at least be given a chance to rectify them. </PARA>
<PARA> The culture that builds up around a school, particularly over a period of 33 years, entwines itself with the spirit of a community until it becomes part of the essence of that community. To suddenly remove that essence is akin to going to one's doctor for an annual checkup only to find oneself on the operating table with the surgeon waving his knife in front of your eyes, babbling about removing some deadly, previously undiscovered cancerous growth.</PARA>
<PARA> To say that it is a shock to the system would be an understatement. Patients need time to prepare themselves for an operation; they need to be convinced of the necessity of the operation; they need to be convinced that there are no other options. The Catholic Education Office appears not to have done this. It has left the social worker at home and gone straight for the scalpel; and people, including me, are asking why. What is wrong with Mount Carmel College?</PARA>
<PARA> I arranged to meet with representatives of the Catholic Education Office. As expected they were reasonable men who had a job to do. I deal with bureaucrats every day as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. My Department and many other departments, Commonwealth and State, have been through or are currently going through the rationalisation process. I understand the economic argument. Almost every business in private enterprise is currently going through similar cost-cutting measures. If the Catholic Education Office had simply said it was the money, it was going broke, I would at least have understood it, if not necessarily accepted it. But the money was not the central argument. There was no doubt the school was losing money and was projected to lose more money as the years went by. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other considerations as well, I was told. For a start, the other schools in the Catholic system were less than happy at subsidising Mount Carmel from their profits. That is quite understandable, but there are other schools within the Catholic system running at a loss. Why start with Mount Carmel? Is it so badly run? No. I was told the teaching staff were highly professional. It was simply that Mount Carmel was not attracting enough students. Already there were composite classes in years 11 and 12. I was told that for the sake of the students and their education, the school had to close so that the students could get a better education elsewhere. Class sizes were down to 15 in some areas, when in a normal school class sizes are 20 to 25 in the senior school and 25 to 30 in the junior school. </PARA>
<PARA> I know some teachers who would give their right arm to teach to classes of 15. Research has proved beyond a doubt that smaller class sizes are conducive to better learning. As far as composite classes are concerned, if varied teaching techniques are used, as is often the case in primary schools, then the learning experience can be enhanced rather than diminished. If the academic standard of the school had markedly dropped over past years, I may have been persuaded, but I was told that the academic record of the school was quite solid. The question comes back to why the enrolment at Mount Carmel is dropping. Apart from having a solid academic record, the school conducts extracurricular activities and some innovative programs. When told of these by the Mount Carmel action group, I was impressed. This does not sound to me like a dying school. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested to me that the population trends in the Wynnum and Manly areas constitute a major reason for the closure of the school. I was told that there would be no point in conducting a recruiting drive because the pool of available students is not large enough. I believe that this argument ignores the school's true potential catchment area for students. That area includes Hemmant, Tingalpa, Wakerley and Gumdale which are nearby areas targeted for substantial growth over the next 10 years, as well as the Redlands area which is already a rapidly growing centre of population and is in my electorate, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> Growth in the Redlands area over the last few years has been as much as 6 or 7 per cent per annum. The catchment area for the Mount Carmel College, if looked at properly, is some 100,000 people plus in terms of population. Many of them are young people who have recently married or people who have daughters of that age. I admit that the growing bayside population is well served by a wide range of public and private schools. However, Mount Carmel is the only Catholic girls school in this large and growing area and as such plays an important role in the provision of a choice for all parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Redlands area currently has no Catholic secondary school, although the Federal Government has recently given approval for recurrent expenditure for a Catholic co-educational secondary school at Thornlands in the Redlands area, naturally with my support. I know that when Thornlands is up and running it will become a popular and successful school. However, it is likely that Thornlands will not become fully operational to the year 11 and 12 level until 1997. Therefore, the closure of Mt Carmel College would mean that there would be no education offered to Catholic girls in the bayside area for some years. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that the burgeoning bayside population means that the Thornlands Catholic Secondary School, Mt Carmel College and the other existing private schools in the bayside can co-exist harmoniously, complementing each other by providing the widest possible range of choices for parents in the education of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put that there is an inadequate transport system in the Wynnum-Manly area to allow easy access to Mt Carmel. This overlooks the fact that Mt Carmel is situated within short walking distance of a train station. A train line runs through the Redlands, a massive student catchment area that the Catholic Education Office admits that it has not seriously tried to tap into. </PARA>
<PARA> The Catholic Education Office representatives made it clear that the Office does not have the funds to go on an expensive marketing exercise. I can understand and appreciate this, but if the parents and the community are so strongly against the closure of the school then they at least deserve a chance to market the belief that they have in Mt Carmel's educational viability. This is the part I find difficult to understand: why the policy of confrontation before consultation? I am not the font of all knowledge, the parents and the students of Mt Carmel are not the font of all knowledge, and neither is the Catholic Education Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record before this House how impressed I have been by the dedication and commitment shown by the parents of the girls at Mt Carmel College, especially those involved in the formation of the Mt Carmel Action Committee, which is fighting to save the school. The Mt Carmel Action Committee has already made extensive contacts across the bayside area to gauge potential support for the school. </PARA>
<PARA> The local newspapers, the Wynnum Herald, the Redland Times and the Bayside Bulletin, have made it very clear that they will provide the school with every assistance in promotion. All these papers are widely read and play very important roles in binding the bayside community together and their help would, in fact, be invaluable. Many other successful schools on the bayside would attest to this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential for a substantial Mt Carmel marketing strategy is all there. The only thing lacking is the opportunity. Even St Peter was forewarned in the garden-forewarned is forearmed. Mt Carmel received no such warning. As a consequence, it now deserves a chance to get its house in order. It is likely that a final decision on the future of Mt Carmel College will be made at a meeting of the Catholic Education Council next Monday. I have already written to all members of the Council urging them to consider the strong arguments in favour of the continuation of Mt Carmel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Catholic education system in Australia has a very proud tradition of providing education to children from all sectors of the community, especially the most disadvantaged groups. Mt Carmel is a proud part of that tradition and it can continue to contribute if the Council will simply give it the chance. The ball is firmly in the Council's court. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned that the Catholic Education Office tried the consultation process previously in regard to school closures and it found it difficult. No-one ever said consultation was easy. Do we see society abandoning, for instance, the jury system simply because it is a long, drawn out and often emotive process? Justice is never easy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Mt Carmel Action Committee knows that it has a lot of hard work in front of it if the Catholic Education Council makes the fair decision next Monday. It knows that only too well, but it also knows that it cannot wait to meet that challenge to prove that Mt Carmel can become the vibrant educational institution it was designed to be. It is eager and full of enthusiasm. Surely this should be encouraged and not cut out with a surgeon's knife. In its efforts to keep the school open, I wholeheartedly support it, and trust that on Monday the Catholic Education Council will do the right thing. I wish the school and the students, who, I understand, are probably listening to this, all the very best and I hope they are there for a long time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a still relatively new member, I was struck by the recent television and broadcasting rules which excluded the adjournment debate. I did a little bit of research and found that the television rules are aligned with the radio broadcasting rules, so I delved a little bit more into history. I am sure I do not have to remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the first parliamentary radio broadcast was made on 10 July 1946-well before your time, of course. Prior to that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings recommended with respect to periods during which proceedings were to be broadcast that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The broadcast shall commence on each sitting day at the time to be fixed for the meeting of the House . . . and shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 12 July 1946, two days after the first broadcast, the Committee met to review the general principles. It was agreed that they should be amended in order that on those occasions when the sitting of the House continues to a late hour, the parliamentary broadcast may cease at a time earlier than when the adjournment is moved. To achieve this, the Committee recommended-and both Houses agreed-that the words `or at 11.30 p.m., whichever is the earlier' should be added. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker Rosevear, as Chairman of the Committee, when presenting the Committee's report concerning this change, explained the origins of the cessation of the broadcast at 11.30. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The committee examined the times at which the adjournment had been moved over a recent period of twelve months . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also ascertained that the cost of extending the broadcast past 11.30 p.m., the time at which the second national stations normally close down, would be approximately #50 an hour. It was considered that, even though the number of occasions on which the adjournment is moved later that 11.30 p.m. is likely to be relatively small, the continuation of the broadcast to a late hour cannot, as a general practice, be justified. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasons why the proceedings on the adjournment are not broadcast even if these proceedings take place before 11.30 p.m. are, however, not clear. It is perhaps instructive to recall some of the debate of 5 July 1946. Mr Menzies, the then member for Kooyong and Leader of the Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Surely the report of the committee should read `shall cease when the motion for the adjournment of the House has been carried' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, all that I say is that this proposal of the joint committee, if adopted, will automatically exclude one debate which is a well-established characteristic of this Parliament, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We are now 45 years on, but I need to go back briefly to that debate-to Mr Holt, the then member for Fawkner-who said:</PARA>
<PARA>As a member of the committee which prepared this report, I ask the House to accept it as a working basis upon which to begin. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We had also to take into consideration the technical limitations of the broadcasting system. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) that the exclusion of debates on the motion for the adjournment of the House is undesirable, but as many of the speeches made on that motion relate to one electorate only, and as the debates come on at a very late hour, it was thought that, at the beginning, at any rate, they should be excluded. It was also thought desirable that the listening public and the broadcasting authorities should know approximately when the broadcasting for the day would finish. </PARA>
<PARA>A final brief quote from that 1946 debate gives us a brief glimmer of hope for the future. Mr Fraser, the then member for Eden-Monaro, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The committee is treading new ground, and attempting to solve vast problems. Some of them can be solved only in the light of experience. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that we now have considerable experience of broadcasting. I would remind the House of what is said as to why we broadcast proceedings. I quote from page 735 of House of Representatives Practice, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Broadcasting of Parliament can play an important part in the political education of the people, enabling them to be better informed on both sides of those public questions which attract an alternative point of view. It has been seen as an aid to the more effective functioning of a democratic system of government. In recommending that the proceedings of the Australian Parliament be broadcast, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting expressed the view that as a result of broadcasting the community would be better able to make informed judgments on matters affecting the common good and the public interest, nationally and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>The question of broadcasting of the adjournment debates has been considered by the Broadcasting Committee, I understand, on several occasions since. In 1950 and again in 1970, the Committee concluded that there should be no change to the established practice. The matter was again considered in 1978. On that occasion the Committee recommended that the adjournment debates in the House of Representatives be broadcast. Senate members indicated that senators would not support broadcasting their adjournment debate. The Committee's report was adopted in the Senate on 10 April 1978, but at the dissolution of the Parliament, the matter had not been debated in the House and remained an item of unfinished business. The recently retired Clerk of the House, Mr Browning, on page 741 of House of Representatives Practice states:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings . . . recommended that radio broadcasting of proceedings continue on the present basis but that the extension of broadcasts until 11.55 p.m. ( to include adjournment debates) be considered. It also recommended that committee proceedings be made available for broadcast; . . . As at the dissolution of the 34th Parliament the recommendations had not been acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the last decade, the Broadcasting Committee has been specifically advised that, first, the national broadcasting stations taking the parliamentary broadcast actually close later than they did in 1946; thus the question of the cost of keeping them on the air, especially for the parliamentary broadcast, simply does not arise and, secondly, the adoption by both Houses of standing or sessional orders which provide for the motion for the adjournment to be automatically put earlier than 11.30 p.m. fundamentally changes the situation from that obtaining in 1946. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, enough of history. It seems the relevance of past objections are no longer valid; technical limitations are no longer valid. For goodness sake, we have instant worldwide communications. The lateness of the hour of debate is no longer valid. People are attuned to round the clock news of events, whether it is the Gulf War, cricket from the West Indies or, perhaps, the option to listen to their Parliament. The cost is no longer relevant, as the radio stations are on the air in any case. The hour of the broadcasting close-down is no longer relevant as we have 24 hour radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the only argument that is still current is that the adjournment debate often affects only one electorate. So what? Our constituents, surely, are entitled to hear what we have to say. In this sort of debate we are engaged in now, the grievance debate, we have just heard a member talk about one electorate and the constituents can hear that. There are limited opportunities for backbenchers, so why stifle those opportunities?</PARA>
<PARA> Often, matters of principle that have no other outlet are brought up in the adjournment debate. I would suggest that often the matters raised in that debate are of much more interest than the fisheries protection Bill or some other form of dry legislation, however worthy that legislation may be. Anyway, the members of the audience do not have to listen. This is a democracy. They can turn it off if they wish, but surely they should be given such a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the radio broadcast and televising of parliamentary proceedings, including the adjournment debate, will go some way to restoring the relevance of this House in the affairs of the nation. It will make individual members that much more visible and relevant to their constituents and it will show that, even after 45 years, this place is capable of catching up with the times. I urge honourable members to grasp the benefits offered by broadcasting adjournment debates from this place, starting at the earliest opportunity. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the grievance debate today, I would like to draw to the attention of the House the plight of thousands of people in Australia suffering from Alzheimer's disease. As some honourable members will be aware, this disease is also known as senile dementia. It is a sad sentence for many and condemns them to a life during which they may be physically healthy for years, but not be able to remember anything of consequence or even recall the enjoyment of normal pleasures previously taken for granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future for their families as their carers is an equally dismal one, although, arguably, much more desperate because they are capable of understanding what lies ahead for the sufferer. They must dedicate themselves to supervising an individual whom they love but who does not or may not know them and may not be capable of loving them in return. They may as well be strangers under these circumstances. This human tragedy requires an urgent and special approach given the numbers of people involved, the otherwise healthy state of most dementia sufferers and the toll which the expectations of continuous care take on their families. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently approached by a representative of the Alzheimer's Association in Western Australia on the need for a national task force on dementia. A short paper presented by the Association on that occasion bears reading to the House as it puts the case for such a national task force succinctly and convincingly. The task force paper reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Accompanying the greying of the Australian population there is a projected rise in the prevalence of dementia which is expected to be two to three times the general population growth rate. This large and growing health problem has been called ``the rising tide'' or ``the silent epidemic''. At this time there is no sign of effective prevention, treatment or cure. According to Henderson and Jorm the percentage increase in dementia cases between 1987 and 2011 will vary from a minimum of 79% in Tasmania to a maximum of 380% in the Northern Territory. If we look ahead to the year 2031, that percentage increase jumps to a minimum of 184% in South Australia to a maximum of 1,345% in the Northern Territory. A recent American study has produced carefully documented evidence of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease in over 47% of a sample of people aged 85 years or older . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The families of people with dementia need a range of home-based and residential service and care options. Currently most people with dementia are cared for at home, and many families prefer this provided they receive adequate support and respite care. Government services supplement but should not supplant family services. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, we have been aware of increasing problems for some 10-15 years, but the strategies that have been put in place to deal with this impending epidemic have developed on an ad hoc basis. There is a need for national co-ordination. On humane and socioeconomic grounds it is essential to address both immediate and long-term care issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government and Departmental officers have sought advice on the direction of policies to cope with this imminent problem. Scarce financial resources have been allocated to establish some innovative programs and community input has been sought. However, there is still concern that the fundamental problems of the organisation of services and the specialised needs of this group have not been properly met. To date we still do not have clear, integrated policies and strategies sufficient to meet the challenge of dementia. </PARA>
<PARA> Soon the system will no longer be able to cope with the increased demand, and the confusion of unco-ordinated services will waste financial resources and prove increasingly ineffective. There is an urgent need to reappraise the administrative arrangements for the delivery of services to dementia sufferers and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA> When the community was faced with the numerically lesser problem of AIDS, a National Task Force was formed and national strategies devised and implemented. Dementia, though less emotive as an issue, threatens no less dramatic an impact on Australian society. Within 20 years over a million Australians will be affected as family members. Undoubtedly the Government's Mid-Term Aged Care Review will receive copious evidence about the problem of dementia in Australia. However 10% of people with dementia are aged under 65, and the issue of dementia therefore extends beyond the field of aged care. The establishment of a National Task Force on Dementia would be a logical outcome of the current Review process. Only a National Task Force can produce, monitor and ensure the integration and implementation of national policies and strategies adequate to meet the challenge of dementia in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We must remember that dementia sufferers require supervision rather than the intensive care associated with frail aged and ill people. Boarding house style accommodation with a live-in nurse or caretaker may well provide sufficient assistance for many-somewhere relatives could bring sufferers when respite was required, for whatever reason, on a fairly regular basis. Alternatively, a home based, live-in assistance service along the lines of Silver Chain, but without nursing qualifications being a prerequisite for intending carers, could be offered for short term relief where the dementia sufferer was felt to be better off in surroundings that had some relevance to them. It is possible that arrangements such as these could be properly provided as an adjunct to the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that this is already a huge problem in Australia which, with our ageing population, is increasing. It is a problem which threatens women more than men for two reasons. Firstly, women live longer than men and dementia tends to be a product of the ageing process. Secondly, women are usually the carers in our society, so the responsibility for relatives with dementia will most likely fall on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the concept of a national task force on dementia and strongly recommend that this growing problem be addressed urgently and sympathetically by the Government in conjunction with the community it serves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion to bring to the attention of the Australian Parliament and the Australian people the desperate financial plight that our farmers find themselves in today as a result of the rural recession or, perhaps more accurately, the rural depression. A significant amount of the blame for this can be directly sheeted home to the Government and, in particular, to the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-or the undertaker, as he is known in the bush-for giving us the recession we had to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government will forever stand condemned for enforcing on the wealth producers of this country an inflation rate twice that of our trading partners and an interest rate which is virtually the highest in the Western world. This, in turn, has led to an exchange rate higher than it would otherwise be and this has made it so much harder for our exporters to sell their products at a decent price to our overseas trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers of this country find it difficult enough to survive financially through international economic downturns and trade wars-along with the usual run of droughts and floods-without having their own Government belting them around the head with an ill-managed economy which makes it nigh on impossible to keep their farms afloat, let alone feed their families or make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Our wool and wheat industries, traditionally two of the finest industries this country has ever seen, both find themselves in the worst position in their history, and when one adds high interest rates to this situation, one sees that the growers of this country are going out backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would particularly like to talk about today is the future of the wool industry and the Vines report, which makes certain recommendations for that industry. The first point I want particularly to make is that growers must become conversant with this report. They have had major decisions dropped on them over the last 12 months or so, such as in April-May last year when the floor price was lowered from 870c to 700c a kilogram, and earlier this year when sales and the reserve price scheme were suspended. I think most growers were uninformed as to why these things were done and were left bewildered and confused. They have been starved of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that further major decisions are going to be made in the industry within a period of a month. I believe the growers should know about those decisions before they are made so they can understand how they are made, why they are made and have some input into the debate. I would urge growers to get a copy of the report, or at least a copy of the executive summary and recommendations, from their local member and read it for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of recommendations in the report. The first and most major recommendation is that the reserve price scheme must go. I think most growers nowadays probably agree with that, as do virtually all farm bodies. It is interesting to note that, in an attempt to save the scheme, over the last 82 weeks, from July 1989 to 28 January 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation spent $5,800m of growers' money trying to prop up and save the scheme. That was the $1.7 billion that the growers had in the kitty when they started, the $2.8 billion which they borrowed which has already increased and the $1.3 billion they have collected from levies and the sale of small amounts of wool from the stockpile. That works out to be about $100,000 a grower or, if one equates it in another way, $21 a sheep or $672 a bale. That is the amount of money that has been spent trying to prop up the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to see in the Vines report a recommendation that the income equalisation deposit system be reviewed. Hopefully, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will bring back a fair dinkum system. The growers of this country would not have quite the problem that they have at the moment if the previous scheme had stayed in place. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting recommendation in the Vines report which has received very little publicity is that competition at auction be looked at very carefully indeed and, if necessary, the Trade Practices Act be reviewed. Vines has also recommended that there be fewer selling centres to increase more competition by having more buyers at the sales. I would like to have input from growers on what they think of these ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> What to do with the stockpile itself is the major decision that has to be made. Growers should understand the seriousness of this matter and what is involved. There are something like 4.7 million or 4.8 million bales there now. It is all very well to say, `Let's freeze it', but it costs growers about 17 per cent in tax, according to what price they are getting, each year just to hold it there doing nothing. However, if they start to sell it, even if they trickle it out at, say, 2 per cent a month, it is going to take 4 1/2 years to get rid of it, which is a long time. Two per cent a month equates to 100,000 extra bales a month being dropped on the market which is already being oversupplied by something like 50 per cent. That, of course, would have a very depressing effect on the market. So we have a very fine balancing act which is not attractive to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vines report has recommended that a 12 per cent tax be put in place after 1 July, that the stockpile be frozen until 1 January 1992 and that the shortfall needed to hold the stockpile and service the debt be picked up by the Government to the tune of $250m a year for each of the next two years. If the Government wants to look at this type of recommendation, it may well be cheaper to fund that recommendation now out of the public purse rather than refuse to do that and pick up a greater liability further down the track. After all, the Government was guarantor for the debt that was allowed to run up. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other recommendations, too. Vines also says that the wool in the stockpile, after it comes out of the frozen state, should not be released on the market until it reaches 500c a kilogram. Most people in this chamber would probably be against that for a whole host of reasons. It puts a ceiling on the market. We have just got rid of a floor and now we are about to have a ceiling put on the market, and it does not allow for flexibility that might be needed in a dynamic marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, other options. Hassall and Associates Pty Ltd, Jonathon Todhunter and others are already putting up suggestions dealing with swapping debt for equity, having growers still retain control of the release of the stockpile, the issue of commodity options, et cetera. These options need to be looked at very closely indeed. The coalition is also looking at a proposal to perhaps reinstate the slaughter scheme because that would take pressure off the stockpile. No doubt we will hear more about that in the not too distant future. Suffice to say that the jury is still out on what should be done with the stockpile. Hopefully some suggestions will be firmed up in the next week or two. It is very vital that the growers know about this now. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation in the Vines report is that the Australian Wool Corporation be disbanded and that a structure of specialist organisations be set up in its place: the Australian Wool Promotions Corporation, which will oversee promotion and marketing which will be done by the International Wool Secretariat; Auswool, to be concerned with quality control of sales and an increased emphasis on sale by description; and the Australian Wool Realisation Committee, which will be concerned with the disposal of the stockpile and management of the debt and will be dissolved after those activities are finalised, probably in 1996. The Minister has already announced that there will be a separate Wool Research and Development Corporation, so there will be four different bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think most people believe that if we are going to have this sort of structure we need to have an overall body and a leader-someone whom we can point to as responsible for the whole thing, a board that can pull all these elements together and coordinate them if necessary. However, there is another school of thought that there should be no boards at all, in the Vines sense of the word, so that the wool industry would be similar to the cotton industry or the pig industry. That idea has some merit. Wool brokers, for example, would have responsibility for sale by description and the growers would promote and market only as far as the immediate buyer goes and not to the end user, which is distant. There are many ideas, some of them very radical, floating around. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say that the growers of this country have done a magnificent job over the last century or two in growing wool. Unfortunately, the industry at the moment is in a state of chaos and difficulty and everybody hopes it can come out of it. I would urge the growers to become conversant with what is happening, what the proposals are, so that they can have vital input into the debate before the decisions are made next month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the evening of 9 April 1991, in another place, Senator Knowles accused me of abusing parliamentary privilege. The honourable senator claimed that in an adjournment speech on 6 March 1991, I maligned an insurance company on the public record, using totally misleading and inaccurate information. I strongly refute the senator's allegations. My grievance is in relation to the false allegations of Senator Knowles and her total lack of research in relation to her speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remote gulf region of my electorate experienced severe flooding earlier this year. Communities in the region were totally isolated for over two months and had to rely on all supplies being flown in by the State Emergency Service. Due to the enormous demands on the SES during this period, and the fact that there are no all-weather airstrips in the area, serious shortages in food and other items were experienced. In an attempt to relieve the situation a sea-barge was organised to carry goods from Cairns to Karumba. However, the sea-barge overturned and all goods on board were lost. Several small businesses which had large consignments on the barge found to their horror that their insurance companies were unlikely to accept liability for the losses because the goods were not insured for marine transport. I argued in the House, first, that the insurance policies were misleading to the lay person and, secondly, that due to the emergency situation that existed, the insurance companies had a moral obligation to meet the claims of their clients. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of making the speech, only one insurance company had formally denied liability for the losses and that was Lumley General Insurance Ltd. In my speech I was particularly critical of Lumleys, not only because I believed that it had used technical legalisms to avoid its moral obligations, but also because of the way in which it handled the matter. I do not in any way resile from my speech and, in fact, after reading what Senator Knowles had to say and concluding that she had been fed false information by this company she so gullibly calls `a fine insurance company', I reinforce my claim that the company should be closely examined by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles claimed that I misled the Parliament in two respects. She claimed, firstly, that I described the items lost on the sea-barge as essential supplies while the senator inferred that the barge was carrying only alcohol. The senator also claimed that I was untruthful in my allegations that Lumleys denied liability without receiving a claim form and refused to send one. I refute both these allegations and wish to provide some supporting evidence in relation to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer firstly to the items lost from the sea-barge. I have in front of me a copy of the bill of lading for the barge. It clearly shows that the vast majority of the cargo consisted of food and dry goods for suppliers in Normanton, Karumba and Mornington island. A quantity of alcohol was on board, but this was insignificant in comparison to the amount of foodstuffs. In addition, there were a number of machinery spares, et cetera, needed to repair and maintain machinery. This can be confirmed by Karumba Transport, which operated the barge concerned. This information, when read in conjunction with my earlier speech which details that the barge was used as a means of last resort in an emergency situation, provides ample evidence that the goods carried by the barge fit the description of essential items under the particular circumstances at hand, and this includes the alcohol supplies on board. </PARA>
<PARA> To my knowledge the only cargo insured by Lumley General Insurance was alcohol for the National Hotel at Normanton. However, as stated above, it was the only company to have formally denied liability as at 6 March 1991. Members of this House will be disappointed to hear that other companies have since formally denied liability for a significant amount of food and dry goods lost on that barge. On 6 March I believed-and believe even more so now-that Lumley General Insurance rated a special mention. In my original speech I stated that Lumley General Insurance would not issue a claim form to its client, thus it had in fact formally denied liability without assessing the claim. Senator Knowles has described this as an absolute untruth and claims that Lumleys would never refuse to send a claim form when requested. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in front me a copy of a statutory declaration from the accountant acting for the National Hotel. In that statutory declaration, the accountant states:</PARA>
<PARA>On the morning of 29th January, 1991, Mrs. Vivienne Furber advised me by telephone that the vessel MV Tasman had sunk off Weipa the day before, and that the cargo included goods belonging to the National Hotel, Normanton. At the clients request I contacted Mr Peter Lynch at the insurance brokers Steeves Lumley Pty. Ltd (the Brokers) to advise that a potential claim existed relating to the Furber's liquor in transit insurance policy with Lumley General Insurance Limited (the Insurer). Following the initial telephone conversation many further telephone conversations transpired between Mr. Lynch and myself. On one such occasion, I requested a claim form to lodge an insurance claim on the incident mentioned above. I was advised that the Brokers would check with the Insurers as to whether they were permitted or allowed to send a claim form. A return telephone call was received from Mr. Lynch advising that the insurers had advised not to send a claim form as this may constitute admission of liability under the policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I also have a copy of a letter sent by Lumley General Insurance to Steeves Lumley Pty Ltd, insurance brokers for the National Hotel, wherein the insurance company states that the loss of the National Hotel does not constitute a claim under the policy concerned. This letter was written without a claim form having been sent or received. I believe it is irrefutable that the company refused to issue a claim form and thus, to quote from the senator, `refused the claim sight unseen'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles is also critical of my communications-or lack thereof-with Lumley General Insurance. Should the senator wish to contact me I would be only too pleased to show her records of all my communications with the company and the insurance brokers extending back to early February. The Brisbane office of the company and the insurance brokers concerned were certainly fully informed of my opinion and understanding of the matter prior to my speech being made in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish by saying that I certainly did not choose Lumley General Insurance as an arbitrary target or scapegoat on political grounds, as the honourable senator claims. My criticisms were deliberate and well supported. They were based on the very human concerns of several small businesses in my electorate which were doing their utmost to survive under natural disaster conditions. I stand by my claims that the action in these circumstances of Lumley General Insurance in particular and other insurance companies in general are to be deplored. As stated by Senator Knowles, it is a valued role of parliamentary privilege to bring to light examples of injustice suffered by ordinary Australians at the hands of large institutions. I believe I did just that. I suggest that Senator Knowles do the same by appropriately representing her constituents in Western Australia and perhaps by disclosing to them what interests she may have in protecting a large insurance company like Lumleys, which I understand has a branch in Perth, her home State. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is interesting to note that the Federal Government has recently announced that it intends setting up a body to boost the rights of consumers as they relate to their dealings with insurance companies. After my dealings with Lumleys Insurance company, I am convinced that this is not before time. I seek leave to table the documents to which I referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost daily we read newspaper reports of fishing vessels entering Australian waters illegally. In four years we have seen the number of such detected vessels increase by 400 per cent-with over 70 so far this financial year. Quite apart from the additional workload being placed on our already stretched naval, Customs, immigration and quarantine resources, it appears that many of these foreign so-called fishermen prefer the relative physical and financial comfort of a northern Australian detention centre to the vagaries of the fishing grounds. I therefore wonder about the genuine intentions of some.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly something has to be done and done quickly to enhance our territorial integrity and to reduce these unnecessary and increasingly expensive violations. I recognise that government authorities are doing their best to cope under difficult circumstances, but the situation appears to be getting very much out of hand. I therefore ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), in particular, what ministerial or government-to-government initiatives are in hand or planned in the short term. What guarantees can both Ministers give to the Australian public that Australia is not becoming a soft touch for such illegal activities? It seems to me that giving some of these people a compassionate inch demonstrably enables them to take a self-interested mile. </PARA>

Subsequent to that, we saw Western Australian farmers-I understand their frustration-breaking into facilities in the West and criticising the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a speech in 1981, I referred to a South Australian Health Commission report which showed that workers at the Radium Hill uranium mine were dying from cancer. Of 12 boilermakers and welders at the uranium mine, seven had died from cancer. One died in 1960, at the age of 35. A health register for uranium miners to monitor exposure to nuclear radiation and radioactive materials is long overdue. I have campaigned for such provisions since 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1977, the International Commission on Radiological Protection set an exposure level for workers in the industry at 50 millisieverts. It now realises that this is too high and has recommended a level of 20 millisieverts. For over 13 years, these workers have been grossly overexposed to radiation. Too many uranium mining workers have already died of cancer and too many live under a death sentence from this evil industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today it gives me great pleasure to talk about a very special person who lives in my electorate. Her name is Annabel Enright, and on the twenty-eighth of this month she will celebrate her 110th birthday, having been born in 1881. Undoubtedly, she is one of the oldest women, if not the oldest woman, in Australia. Annabel Enright was the seventh child in a family of twelve. John Massey, her father, was the first white man on record to be born in Queensland, in 1859, after it was declared a separate State from New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Annabel left school after grade three and worked on the family farm. When in her teens, she went into domestic service, where she met her future husband. She married Cornelius Enright when she was 26, in 1907, and had five children to him. She was a fastidious person and a very strict mother. Money was scarce and she taught all her children how to manage the household, particularly after her husband left her later in life. She made most of her children's clothing. The boys wore shirt fronts under their coats because she could not afford enough material to make entire shirts. One of her daughters says that she had a lovely figure and beautiful long chestnut hair. Having seen the photo albums, I can attest to that. She was a very attractive woman, with a strong face that said, even then, that she was not going to be taken easily from this life. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Enright now lives in a fine nursing home in my electorate, namely Pleasantville at Wynnum. Even though she is a little more frail than when I attended her birthday last year, she is still all heart. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say that Annabel is typical of the pioneering women who overcame hardships with energy and resourcefulness to make Queensland and Australia the great places that they have become. Today this country is again faced with hardship. Perhaps the strength and resourcefulness of this woman could be an inspiration to us all. </PARA>

That is great because some of those people in the gallery might come to Tasmania one day. There are a lot of things down in Tasmania other than the birds, the bees and the trees; there are many industrious people trying to make a living in that State.

There are many people who live in regional and country areas whose incomes are just above the cut-off figure for Austudy. Children who live in cities and who do not get Austudy at least are living at home and their parents do not have to find other accommodation for them. But families in country and regional Australia with student children virtually have to set up a second home. At a time when country and regional Australia is really going through a crisis I think perhaps we should be starting to look at whether we need to take a positive role in ensuring that people who live outside a 100 kilometre radius of a metropolitan area are free of a means test, particularly in times like this.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer specifically to the recommendation that suggests that young adults who are aged 25 should not be denied Austudy because of the assets that their parents have. It is a very significant report, and it would be wise for the Government to implement the report's recommendations that the age be reduced to 21, and that it be progressively reduced from that, over a series of Budgets, to the age of 18. The fact that non-productive assets deny children access to tertiary education is quite inexcusable. I remind the House that only 8 per cent of rural students access tertiary education, whereas about 27 per cent of urban students access tertiary education. There is ample evidence in those figures alone of the disadvantage that rural students face and I think it should be obligatory for the Government to do something about this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will start, first of all, with the substance of the issue of unemployment by saying that it is the fact that the March labour force statistics show a sharp increase in unemployment. Of course, all of us on this side of the House recognise and greatly regret the suffering in the community that these bare statistics represent in human terms. Of course, some considerable deterioration in labour market conditions was an inevitable consequence of the decisions which the Government had to take and the policies which it had to apply to reduce the level of activity in the Australian economy. I remind the honourable gentleman again of the facts of 1988-89, when expenditure in this country was growing at twice the rate of production. In those circumstances, in which we already had tight fiscal policy and tight wages policy, it was necessary to increase the level of interest rates in order to apply a tighter monetary policy. Having said that, I would hope that the honourable gentleman would acknowledge the plus signs in the economy of a significantly lower inflation rate and improved trade performance, which are, of course, also following from the application of the policies to which I referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to that part of the question which concerns the Treasurer, let me say that the way in which the Treasurer and I operate, and have operated since 1983, is that I do not have to tell the Treasurer what the implications of some area of policy are, nor does he have to tell me what the implications of some area of policy are. Lest there be some suggestion of an attempt within the question to allow me to distance myself from the Treasurer, let me say that the Treasurer and I have been at one in the development of economic policy in this country since 1983. Certainly, I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that I am not going to take some cheap opportunity through this question to move away from the Treasurer. The Treasurer has been, with me, the architect of economic policy since 1983. I would remind the honourable gentleman that in the area of employment, this policy has produced just under 1 1/2 million more Australians in employment in this country today than there were when we came to office.</PARA>
<PARA> If during our period in office we had had the same rate of employment growth as occurred in the previous seven years, there would be 1.2 million fewer Australians in employment today than there are. Those are not opinions; they are facts. I remind the honourable gentleman that in respect of monetary policy it is the Leader of the Opposition who is on record as saying that he would have imposed higher interest rates and who was critical of this Government for bringing them off too early. In other words, the logic of the position of the Leader of the Opposition is that with a given state of fiscal policy-which he could not possibly have had any tighter than this Government had-and with a wages policy that could not have been within a bull's roar of being as tight as the wages policy this Government had, he still would have had an even higher interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The inevitable economic consequence of that is that under the policies he would have imposed there would have been significantly greater unemployment than there is. This is not surprising when we know that, in the immortal words of former Senator Stone, the Leader of the Opposition was one of the meretricious players advising the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That Government, in the absence of a wages policy, did what no other government in the history of this country had been able to do: produce simultaneously double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. That was the contribution the honourable gentleman made. On his own professions now, given what he said he would do in the area of monetary policy, unemployment would be even higher in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me finally say that, as distinct from those opposite, we have put in place a safety net in regard to unemployment benefits and training and retraining programs which those on the other side of this House would abolish. What the people of Australia would have would be higher unemployment and less of a safety net, no training and no retraining provisions at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question, knowing of his interest in housing policy and the housing industry, particularly the area of public housing. At the housing and planning Ministers meeting several weeks ago I offered to bring forward Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds for the next financial year. The States have accepted this offer. The funds, which are in total $842m, will be made available to the States in two payments-on 1 July and 1 October-instead of monthly as at present. These funds are untied funds as well as pensioner rental housing assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member asked what steps the Government might take in relation to stimulating the housing industry. Certainly this offer is designed to boost activity in the housing industry by enabling the States to bring forward their 1991-92 housing construction and purchase programs. In return, State and Territory housing Ministers have agreed to bring forward projects which meet the following objectives: continuing to keep apprentices in employment, using the financial benefits of early payment for their housing programs, and bringing forward projects consistent with achieving higher urban density and better cities.</PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity was taken in the context of this housing and planning Ministers conference to stimulate the housing industry through these measures which I have announced in terms of the bringing forward of funds in the area of public housing. At that conference as well we had a broader discussion about the nature of Australian cities and housing within those cities. The Ministers agreed to a set of objectives for urban development, including economic efficiency objectives that are relevant and ecologically sustainable, and social justice. We agreed that cities must be developed in ways that enhance the productive potential of Australian industry and that development must be as efficient as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of public housing the issue of stimulation is important. It is also important in terms of housing in this country that we work towards providing alternatives, particularly providing alternatives that help us to tackle the problems of the structure and form of Australian cities. So while this measure has been taken because of its employment potential at the moment and the importance of sustaining particularly apprentices within the industry--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7J4">Mr JOHN SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. In light of the significant reductions in protection the Government has undertaken and the increasing exposure to the international competition this entails for Australian industry, what steps is the Government taking to pursue the liberalisation of the tightly controlled markets of other countries, such as the Japanese market, for agricultural products?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2441" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="TRADE AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I would note that Japan is a major market for a wide range of Australian agricultural products. But it is true that our opportunities in that market are limited by the very restrictive barriers-indeed, sometimes the total prohibitions on food imports-that Japan maintains to protect its domestic agricultural producers. It should be noted that such policies not only produce problems for our agricultural producers but also impose quite clear penalty payments on Japanese consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been active in both the bilateral consultations with Japan and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in pressing Japan to open its agricultural markets, and therefore provide to Australia some of the same market opportunities that Japan's industrial producers have got as a result of other countries reducing manufacturing protection as a result of the GATT activities over the last 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that our efforts have yielded some results, although there is much more that Japan could do. In 1988 Australia, together with the United States and New Zealand, agreed to initiate GATT panel hearings on beef access to Japan. This action led to Japan agreeing to liberalise its beef market, and the Australian beef industry has benefited greatly from the opening of the Japanese market since 1988 and will continue to do so. Nevertheless, the fact does remain that, with the tariff on beef at 70 per cent-even though it is to go down to 50 per cent by 1993-the new regime could do with some Australian-type liberalisation, and we will of course be seeking further cuts in the tariff rate post-1993 in the context both of the beef agreement itself and of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, to take up the honourable member's point: yes, we have been closely involved in the GATT panel action taken by the United States seeking the removal of import quotas on a range of agricultural products including dairy products, citrus and other fruit juices, some processed meat and some other processed foods. In responding to this GATT panel, which found against the quantitative restrictions imposed by Japan, Japan did liberalise its import regime on most of the 12 items, but refused to liberalise certain dairy products and starch, and we will be involved in further consultations with Japan on this issue in Geneva later this month.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, more generally as a part of our efforts to achieve fundamental reform of agricultural trade in the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations, we have been encouraging more active participation by the Japanese in the agricultural negotiations, particularly as regards rice. In speaking to the Japanese I have stressed, especially in relation to rice, that we are seeking not dramatic overnight changes but rather a gradual opening of the market which would accommodate Japanese sensitivities while increasing pressure on the European Community and others who remain quite reluctant to make major commitments to real agricultural reform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The suggestion that the Government was in some position to alert the arts community in Australia to the financial difficulties that were being experienced by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust is based on a number of quite incorrect assumptions. It does assume that the Trust was in some way accountable to the Government and that the Government had long notice of those difficulties that had been encountered by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Trust is certainly not accountable to the Government, although I did receive some confidential advice of the Trust's difficulties very shortly before the Trust itself made a public announcement of its position. It would have been totally inappropriate for that information to be made public either by me or by anyone else other than the Trust, because the Trust itself made an announcement as soon as it had itself concluded that it had no clear way out of its own difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, though, that those organisations which have been affected by those difficulties may suffer as a result of the consequence of moneys intended as donations being caught up in the Trust's accounts. I am certain that the Trust itself will certainly do everything possible to ensure that those moneys are passed on, and I have asked the Australia Council for advice on the consequences of the situation for the arts community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Commencing, though, on 25 March, new arrangements for making tax deductible donations to the arts came into effect. These arrangements were announced on the day before. Yesterday, in a joint announcement with the Treasurer, I provided details of the eligibility criteria that will apply to the register system that will be put into place. Because of the importance of those new arrangements for the arts community in Australia, I table that information. My Department-the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories-has commenced a mail-out of application forms to arts organisations. That process began yesterday. I am confident that the new and certainly much more advantageous arrangements will be in place for all qualifying arts organisations in the very near future.</PARA>

Senator Evans, I can assure the House, is of the view that Mr Burke's ability to discharge his duty has not to date been inhibited. Senator Evans will, of course, reconsider the situation should that become necessary.

<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the unemployment that we have seen has been, unfortunately, an unavoidable part of the transition to a lower current account deficit, a lower inflation and a more sensible rationing of credit in the Australian community. But as the public sector of the Commonwealth and the States has yielded savings in response to the current account deficit, it has been more the pity that for a large part of the 1980s those savings have been in part squandered in areas of the economy which have been not productive but less than productive, and that it was not possible for the current account to keep on at the level it was at and that a lower account deficit had to be procured, along with lower inflation and a more sensible rationing of national savings. The price for this in Australia will be high, but in the end it will be a price that I think the Government always believed had to be paid, as it was paid in the United States of America in 1980-81 in the course of lower inflation.

<PARA>This begs the question in January 90 as to how much Mr Keating was pushing the pace of interest rate reductions simply to suit his electoral timetable.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that he and the shadow Treasurer opposed for all it was worth the reduction in interest rates. And it is now highly indecent of them, frankly, to be here saying that interest rates should have been lower earlier when they did their level political best to disparage any interest rate reductions and remove confidence in markets about the sustainability of interest rate reductions, which he said we would introduce further after the election, after conversations with the central bank, and see sustained. The fact is those reductions have not only been sustained; they have also gone lower. We are now down 6.5 percentage points on cash rates and the result is that we are starting to see now some change in the pattern of economic activity which the leading indexes are picking up.</PARA>
<PARA> I round up on the point I began with: these are bad figures; no-one would seek to say otherwise. The only way we will overcome these is by providing sustainable, long term jobs-that is, keeping the 1 1/4 million jobs that have been created and adding to them; getting inflation under control; getting the current account deficit under control; having a sustainable rate of economic growth and one that will not see national savings spread around indiscriminately in companies that have simply bid up the prices of assets to find that they cannot make those funds perform. It is nevertheless a sad fact of life that this kind of transition in the economy has become necessary to lead us to sustainably lower inflation in the current account and more jobs in the long term for Australians.</PARA>

The Opposition was being pressed on this matter and it gave an undertaking that there would not be one. Those opposite were the ones who politicised it in the face of that situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the honourable gentleman that we are vigorously pursuing our goal of permanent protection of the Antarctic. This is just one of several environmental issues, as the honourable gentleman will know, in which Australia is at the forefront not merely of world opinion but of world action, in which we are helping to convince other countries of the need for proper protective measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can also say that our Antarctic initiative, aimed at the permanent protection of the continent, has, I am pleased to say, received very strong international support. Many nations have now endorsed Australia's proposal and few, I am pleased to say, want to keep the mining option open. A new consensus for a comprehensive environmental agreement has emerged.</PARA>
<PARA> An informal working text, which emerged from the meeting in Chile last year as the basis for further negotiations, reflects many of Australia's views on this matter. Australia-together with France, Belgium and Italy-is proposing amendments to further strengthen the text. We will not settle for less than a rigorous, workable and durable regime to meet international expectations for the protection of the area. We will continue to support a complete prohibition on mining. We will not accept any later amendment to the agreed legal instrument without consensus.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that progress towards this goal-and I think it is a goal which would be endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people-has been encouraging, but further success will take a considerable amount of time and a considerable amount of hard work. Unfortunately, there is still a small number of influential countries that continue to object to the prohibition on mining, but I believe the intrinsic merit of the case which Australia has been at the forefront in pushing will, in time, prevail.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. Is the Minister aware that overcrowding in some universities is resulting from institutions enrolling more students than the Commonwealth funds? Can the Minister advise the House of the Commonwealth's role in both the genesis of and solution to this problem?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2447" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a certain amount of media coverage in recent days of problems of overcrowding affecting some higher education institutions. Just to put that in perspective, according to preliminary information from the Department of Employment, Education and Training, across the system we are looking at an overenrolment problem of roughly 5 per cent, but it is enrolments in excess of Commonwealth funded load. That is broadly consistent also with figures produced by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. At this stage those figures are still preliminary. They are based on information which derives from a period prior to 31 March, which is the higher education contribution scheme census date, so they are a little unreliable. Nonetheless there is no doubt and no disputing that we have a significant overenrolment problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point to be made about that is that there is a fairly substantial degree of disparity on a regional basis that is concentrated particularly in Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. More significantly, perhaps the problem is focused on specific institutions. Some institutions have an overenrolment problem of up to 17 per cent, other institutions do not have much of a problem at all.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear that there are factors which are institution-specific in this situation. There is a system-wide problem and we need to explore the reasons for that. One possible set of factors relate to the current state of the labour market and the fact that a higher proportion of students are choosing to continue their courses and re-enrol rather than dropping out and a higher proportion of potential entrants are taking up offers of admission. So those are factors.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, I emphasise that there is a huge discrepancy from institution to institution. We, as a Commonwealth, fundamentally rely on the institutions to meet their enrolment targets and to keep their enrolments within the load factors, both commencing and total load, that the Commonwealth has negotiated with them. In a sense it is a problem of institutional management.</PARA>
<PARA> There do seem to be some factors in common with those institutions which are having problems. It seems to be particularly concentrated on a number of institutions from the former college sector, including those with particularly high part time or external enrolments. There may be some special factors there. I am very keen to subject the more accurate information we expect to get in four to six weeks time to detailed analysis so that we can try to sort out the causes.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will make a couple of further points. If we are talking about a problem of overcrowding and overenrolment, it is necessary to bear in mind this Government's record in the area of higher education building or capital program compares extremely favourably with that of the previous Government. In real terms we are talking about a five-fold growth in the higher education capital program. We have not heard much criticism from the Opposition about this, but I would not expect to hear too much.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the other point is that whatever difficulties there are in making accurate predictions of the proportion of students who will re-enrol and the proportion of students offered places and refusing to take them up and whatever problems that creates in generating overenrolment, that is nothing compared to the sorts of problems of a similar nature that would be encountered were we to go down the Opposition's route and introduce a higher education voucher scheme. That would introduce an incomparably higher degree of unpredictability and difficulty in matching up higher education capital or building programs and total enrolments. I just make those observations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of the problem; it is conscious and concerned about it. It is not a problem that can be fixed in the short term. We cannot create buildings and facilities overnight, but we are looking at the implications of that and we take the problem very seriously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia approaches a dark and sad anniversary. Like the recent eighth anniversary of the election victory of the Australian Labor Party in 1983, this forthcoming day will pass unremarked and unwanted. Next month the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will become Australia's longest serving Labor Treasurer by surpassing Ben Chifley's record of eight years and two months. Of Australia's 30 Treasurers he will become the second longest serving after Artie Fadden, who served for nearly 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As everybody knows, around our Treasurer swirls great confusion about numbers. I wonder which number will actually stick to him. Will he be remembered as Mr Six Per Cent, to reflect his high standing in the Australian community? Will he be remembered as the 131 billion dollars man, to remind us of the legacy of his debt? Will he be remembered and portrayed as the punting Treasurer-the figure of fun and ridicule so brilliantly displayed in that excellent play, which I recommend to all honourable members, currently on in Melbourne? The play is entitled A Royal Commission into the Australian Economy, in which we have a frantic and desperate Treasurer siphoning off a billion dollars of funds through Treasury to put it onto a 66-to-one chance at an Asian jockey club as a final desperate measure to save the Australian economy. Will it be any one of these numbers that finally sticks to the Treasurer? Sadly, I do not think so. In fact, I think the number that will stick to this Treasurer is the figure for unemployment. He will become known and will be remembered as Mr Nine Point Two Per Cent or Mr Ten Per Cent or Mr Eleven Per Cent or Mr Twelve Per Cent-a testimony to the cruel legacy of his recession policy. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Labor Party really does value mateship and places a high value on it, then Labor history will treat this Treasurer very harshly. The average blue- collar working person, that long-time Labor voter, will not forget a Prime Minister and an arrogant Treasurer who lowered wages, justifying that lowering on the basis that it would create jobs, and who then turned around and engineered a soul- destroying and job destroying recession. It is worth remembering that it was only 12 months or so ago that the Treasurer said that there would be no recession; he would not let there be a recession. Later in the year he was the last person in Australia to admit that we were in a recession. He then had the gall to say that it was the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had, not so long ago, the December quarterly accounts. In those quarterly accounts on the size and growth of the national economy, there are four figures. There are three base figures and a fourth figure that is the average of the first three. The trend on all the figures was negative. However, the one figure which was positive was the 0.6 per cent figure. What did we hear from the Treasurer? He heralded an economic recovery. Even if we looked at the 0.6 figure and adjusted it for the terms of trade, we saw that it was negative. A few days later the Treasurer was in South Australia. He was not just saying that the recovery was around the corner; he was saying that the recovery was with us. He was citing building statistics to support his case. </PARA>
<PARA> On the very same day, back in Canberra, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its latest building approvals. What did they show? They did not show that building approvals were going up; they were going down. They absolutely pulled the rug out from beneath the Treasurer's feet. The fact is that the Treasurer is a fraud. I ask the Treasurer to talk to anybody outside of Canberra, and he will hear the truth about the economy. The fact is that if the Treasurer were in his own electorate and dropped off at a corner, he would be lost without his Comcar. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the situation in Sydney for honourable members. In today's Sydney Morning Herald a survey showed half of Sydney's architects out of work. If the Treasurer cannot go to his own electorate, I will describe the situation in my electorate on the Mornington Peninsula. I will introduce the Treasurer to Peter Jay, who has been a builder for 20 years and has a good reputation. He said the other day that his turnover had reduced from $1m a year or so ago to a quarter of a million dollars-a 75 per cent drop. I could take the Treasurer around the corner into the council chambers of the Shire of Mornington and introduce him to Kevin Clarke, who could tell him that there has been a massive drop-off in the council's revenue from building fees and planning permits. I could introduce the Treasurer to the building firm, Nixons, who have been on the Peninsula for 20 to 25 years. That firm said the other day that there has been a huge downturn, reflecting a lack of confidence by people who are no longer willing to commit themselves to building. That firm stated:</PARA>
<PARA>People go to get a loan to buy or build and the bank manager says the loan will be at 13 per cent interest. People just don't know if they'll still be paying the same interest in four months time . . . it's a lack of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that all of this has led to tremendous suffering and social distress for literally tens of thousands of Australians. Families are breaking up. Young families are deferring having children. Many of our businesses are going broke or bankrupt. There are suicides. There are families having their homes sold from beneath them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the social welfare agencies literally bursting at the seams attempting to deal with the human consequences of the tragedy of the Treasurer's policy. Today's figures represent the culmination of that great suffering throughout the Australian economy as a result of his recession. The figures are literally rocketing up. In the last 12 months the number of people on the unemployment queues has gone from something like 550,000 Australians to now over 820,000 Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The seasonally adjusted figure today is 9.2 per cent. The original figure is nudging towards 10 per cent. Today's figure is 9.6 per cent. Beyond that, if we look around the States we find that Queensland and Western Australia have already broken the 10 per cent unemployment barrier. If that is not bad enough, beyond that again-beyond just the official unemployment figures-we have literally hundreds of thousands of Australians who are underemployed, who would work more days in the week if they could, who would work more hours in the week if only the job opportunities were there. There are 440,000 people in that position. If we combine the two, we find that 1.264 million Australians are out of work as a result of the policy the Treasurer had the gall to say at Question Time we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> When I sit down and the Treasurer stands we will hear all the same old nonsense. First, he will blame somebody else-it is somebody else's fault-and then he will say, `Unemployment under us is not as bad as unemployment under the last Government'. If we combine the unemployment rate and the underemployment rate, it is higher now than it has been for a very long period. </PARA>
<PARA> The average rate of unemployment during the Fraser years, 1976 to 1982, was 5.8 per cent. Does the Treasurer know what it is today? Does he know what it is? No, he does not. That is his problem. He does not have the basic idea or the basic understanding. It is 7.7 per cent. On today's figure, it is rising. </PARA>
<PARA> Another furphy is the 1.5 million jobs created by Labor. A few weeks ago it was 1.6 million. From the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today at Question Time it was 1.5 million, and then the Treasurer gets up and says it is 1.25 million. I would be interested to know what he thinks it is. There is no question that it is on the way down. Of that 1.5 million jobs-if we take that figure-the Treasurer claims that that is all as a result of his policies, that he has created those jobs. But the economy has got bigger; the population has grown. Of that 1.5 million, we can take out 920,000, which simply represents the normal growth in the size of the economy as the build-up in population goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the 900,000, we should look at the quality of those 716,000 extra jobs. There are two interesting figures there. We find that 420,000 of the 716,000 were part time. Again, of the 716,000, 580,000 were female. What is the explanation for that? It is pretty simple. The Treasurer has been forcing the mums of Australia back to work for two simple reasons: firstly, to pay the high interest rates on their mortgages, which are a direct result of his policy; and, secondly, to get in a few extra dollars to make the family budget balance. That reflects a simple fact, that is, that the Treasurer has been running a low wage policy. He has been boasting that his policy has reduced people's wages. The people who have had to pay for that in suffering and hardship-he has forced many people back into the work force-are the mums, as those figures indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have an absolute tragedy for this country, perhaps the worst set of economic circumstances for 60 years. At a time when the country really needs some leadership, what do we get from this Government? We get nothing but dissension and factional infighting. We have the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in a telephone box in Melbourne speaking to the Centre Left, undermining one of the fundamentals of the Treasurer's policy on the exchange rate. He says this at a private meeting and he boxes a 29-page speech in Canberra. It was a fundamental, premeditated attack on the basis of the Treasurer's policy. We have Ministers fighting over Commonwealth-State relations in the social security area. On uranium, we have senior Ministers bickering over whether or not they should abolish the illogical three mines uranium policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got the Prime Minister exercising some discipline, telling Ministers that they have got to stick to within their portfolios. Then we have the Deputy Prime Minister at a press conference just a couple of days ago saying, `Of course, uranium is a special issue and you can all sing like birds on that as much as you like'. On basic economic policy, on the question of interventionism-to use the Treasurer's term, the new interventionist and the old interventionist-we have the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) running his own campaign for what ought to be included in the March industry statement; all of which leads to the simple leadership paralysis within the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It was really brought home to me earlier this week. I was sitting at my desk-I hope you listen to this, Treasurer-and I took a phone call from someone I have only ever met once, but who is a public figure, well known within Labor Party circles. This person rang me and had a tip for me. This person, I might add, is well known as a confidante of the Prime Minister. The tip to me was simply this: `The uranium debate is on within the Labor Party. The Treasurer's position on uranium needs to be exposed. I have got a couple of embarrassing questions you ought to put to him during Question Time'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put those two questions to the Treasurer now. Why has the Government failed to sell its uranium oxide stockpile as foreshadowed in the last two Budgets? Secondly, given that the final report of the Industry Commission on mining and mineral processing in Australia is expected to recommend the abolition of the current three mines policy, when will the final report which has been signed and delivered to him be released? Those are the two questions from the Prime Minister's mate. I have a third question for the Treasurer; it is my own. What does all this say about the Treasurer's relationship with the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> This is a good country. We have great people. We have tremendous natural resources and we have a stable, political democracy, but it has been badly managed-appallingly managed-in recent years. What we desperately need is some leadership. We need an economic program for recovery and we need the people to implement it. What I say to the Treasurer is that he ought to cast aside his own personal ambitions and, for once, look to the national interests. He ought to adopt a series of policies which, over a period of time, will start to drag this country out of the recession that he created. Firstly, he ought to scrap the accord, that deal with his union mates, and he ought to scrap the $12 increase in May to save people's jobs. Beyond that, he ought to move to change the whole industrial relations system. Yes, it is going to mean taking on the power of the trade union bosses that keep him in power, but that would be in this country's long term interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to have legislative changes to ensure compliance with directions of the Industrial Relations Commission, and we ought to have a legal framework to enable employees and employers to enter into their own agreements. We ought to abolish the capital gains tax and introduce a goods and services tax. We ought to have some incentive back into our tax system. We ought to privatise a lot of government business enterprises and we ought to cut back the size of government. The Treasurer should take on the union thugs on the waterfront to give Australia a more efficient waterfront as part of a recovery program. Finally, I simply ask the Treasurer, when he stands, just for once to give us an honest appraisal of the circumstances facing this economy and to tell us what he is going to do about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not the first cheap political speech that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has made on a serious subject like employment. He talks about the problems of the unemployed. He is in there with crocodile tears about the unemployed, but his policy is that after nine months they are off the dole and on their own. He has said it over and over again: after nine months, they are off the dole and on their own-whether they have got families, children or what-have-you. So he is up here crying crocodile tears.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member stands by it and endorses it. That is right. After nine months they are out. He has even corroborated what I have said-after nine months they are finished. There is the crass insincerity of it. Five minutes ago he was saying, `Isn't this a dreadful thing that Australians are being put out of work and all these women are working?'; he was making all these sorts of points. But when we say, `What about maintaining these people in their diminished circumstances?', the reply is, `No. After nine months they are out'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So under the Opposition, where do they go after nine months if they have a family? Where do they go: down to the soup kitchen, the St Vincent de Paul Society, or the Smith Family? Where do they go? That is the Opposition's policy. Mr Deputy Speaker, when the country does have difficulties and there is mounting unemployment, the contrast between the remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) today on this subject and those of the shadow Treasurer is profound. In terms of horses for courses, what it shows is that cheap and nasty political speeches by slick machine politicians like the shadow Treasurer will do the country no good whatsoever. He does not comprehend, unlike the honourable member for Bennelong, who, when asked, `Does the Liberal Party have a quick fix?', said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are no quick fixes. Nobody has a quick fix to the current high levels of unemployment? Nobody does . . . the only way you will get a reduction in unemployment will be to get people investing again and get the confidence back. </PARA>
<PARA>No, that is not the sort of speech we heard from the shadow Treasurer. What we got from him was a cheap and nasty Liberal Party version that he would do on a Monday night around the branches. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just say this about jobs: the shadow Treasurer said that the Government had lowered wages to increase jobs, to increase employment. Then he tried to say, shabbily, that they had not been increased. They have been increased. Does he want to know the number? There have been 1.454 million jobs created since 1983. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what the Opposition created in the previous seven years? About a quarter of a million; about 250,000 or 300,000 was its best in seven years. In the past seven years we had 1.45 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Smith interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shabby, paltry apology just mentioned by the honourable member for Bass was, `Oh, they hadn't been breeding'; in other words, the economy had not been growing. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you believe that? He said, `The population had not been growing when we were around, so you had to create those'. It would not have mattered if the population was growing or not: the Opposition could not create the jobs-and the population growth has been the same throughout the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the participation rate under this Government has been much higher than under the previous Government: more people have been employed, including women. I know that those in the Liberal Party have the view of women that they do not believe a woman has a right to a job or should have a job. That is what the shadow Treasurer has just said. They think their place is in the kitchen and nowhere else. If a women takes a job, the shadow Treasurer says, she has done it because she has been forced to do it-not because she would like employment or the interest or independence of employment. No; no independence. `Your place is in the house, and know your place'-that is the Liberal Party's policy towards women; that is its sort of antediluvian sort of policy towards women. And it was again expressed by this chauvinist opposite in his remarks of a few minutes ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a sad fact that unemployment has risen. But we have still kept 1.454 million jobs since 1983, notwithstanding the rise in unemployment. That is the important point. The case made by the shadow Treasurer-that we have lowered wages while we have destroyed employment-without referring to the 1.454 million jobs which have been retained since 1983-84 just underlines his shabbiness on yet another occasion. Then he said that this was the worst economic position in 60 years. Yet he fails to come to terms with these fundamental differences-not just now but with the economy of 1982-83, which his Party bequeathed to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me compare the differences. At the moment we have declining inflation; in 1982-83 those opposite had rising inflation. At the moment we have a structurally high profit share and low real unit labour costs; those opposite had a structurally low profit share, bad investment and high real unit labour costs. We have investment still running above the average of the last 25 years; those opposite had it at one of the lowest levels in the last 25 years. We have low levels of taxation and revenue, a large structural budget surplus and a competitive exchange rate; those opposite had a massive Budget deficit and an uncompetitive managed exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the various differences. We have declining inflation, high profits, low real unit labour costs, investment running higher than in the last 25 years, low levels of revenue, a structural Budget surplus and a competitive exchange rate, and yet the shadow Treasurer has the gall to get up and say this is the worst position in 60 years. He jokes! It is a pathetic joke. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I underline that today's release by Westpac Banking Corporation of its leading index is up for the second time in a month. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Though it is still too early to say positively that the leading index is foreshadowing an upturn in the Australian economy in the latter half of 1991, the signs are promising that this message may not be far ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that assessment. In fact, I think the signs are stronger than the signs which the leading index has picked up. This is the only way to repair Australia's position-that is, to get back to a sustainable rate of growth in the economy, a sustainable rationing of credit in the economy, a lower current account deficit and a lower inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to take the foolish view that the world will continue to fund a growing current account deficit-growing willy-nilly out of control-with spending running at twice our capacity to produce and with an inflation rate which is out of line with our trading partners for yet another decade, making it three decades, not two, I think we would all be selling the longer term interests of Australians down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that there is no easy way to reduce the current account deficit, of lifting the supply capacity of the economy or reducing inflation. As other countries have come to realise, there is no easy way, particularly when we saw the financial industry splurge scarce savings so indiscriminately in the 1980s, whether it was on the Adsteams, the Bond Corporations or whatever. There had to be some accountability for this activity and behaviour and there had to be again a responsibility on national government to pull it all up, to pull it into check-which is what we have done. </PARA>
<PARA> This will produce over the 1990s a sustainable rate of growth-sustainable in terms of the current account, with the current account deficit declining, with a suture being put on the growth of our national debt, particularly from trade, and with a declining rate of inflation, which will reduce the cost of capital, which will make savings more attractive and which will mean that, with a lower cost of capital, we can underpin higher rates of investment, and with them produce a more competitive structure. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are not in control of our inflation rate, there is nothing but for our exchange rate to equilibrate to those higher levels of inflation. That means more inflation for Australians and it means a higher national debt as the stock of our debt is revalued up in Australian dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done the only sensible and responsible thing, and that is to prick the crazy bubble, the balloon, of 20 per cent credit growth which we had because people believed in assets speculation and believed that they could basically make their fortunes and wealth by bidding up the price of assets, not focusing on the fundamentals of wealth-that is, the production of wealth from truly productive sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the difference. The Government has had the courage actually to introduce these remedial changes. As we introduced them, we suffered all the time. We suffered the abuse of the Opposition for lifting interest rates; then when we went to take them off, as I did with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in January 1990, we wore the admonition of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and shadow Treasurer for trying to trick interest rates down. They were opposed to interest rate reductions which we thought were then necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that we reduced those interest rates for the first time 15 months ago. We were trying to avoid a recession and to bring the economy and spending within gross domestic product; that is, creating an exportable surplus by keeping GDP ahead of gross national expenditure, or keeping product ahead of spending, so that the difference was exportable-an exportable surplus, net exports-to bring down the current account deficit. That has been the cast of the policy. Frankly, the odds were always against Australia getting its inflation rate down in the 1980s with a very low profit share and an uncompetitive exchange rate, because when the exchange rate needed to be adjusted downwards, as it did by nearly 30 per cent in 1985-86, there was a sharp boost to inflation and it went from 5 per cent just about back to 10 per cent by the following 12 months. In other words, the price of getting a competitive exchange rate was a very high leap in inflation back to nearly 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The price of getting the abysmal profits of the 1970s and early 1980s back to a decent level to restart investment was that some of those profits came from higher prices, which also fed into the inflation rate. The Government in the 1980s restored the basis of Australian competitiveness, but at some cost to the inflation rate. That is why we cannot now leave that inflation rate out of line with those of other countries; it has to be pulled back into line. However, in the 1990s the prospects for inflation are much better, because we already have that big competitive fall-down in the exchange rate behind us; we already have the profit share high, from higher prices; and we do not have the forces working against us on inflation in the 1990s as we did in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> That is also true of employment. In the 1980s, for every job the Government created we had to find 13 extra jobs for the long term unemployed because of the sloth in employment which existed from the 1970s into the early 1980s. A lot of that is now behind us, and even though unemployment has risen sharply, it will, because of a high participation rate, fall as the economy starts to grow. It will not fall slowly as it did in the early 1980s with all that hidden unemployment, because the participation rate is so much higher. That is why on the basis of employment and inflation the trends in the 1990s, because of the work this Government has done in the 1980s in lifting the participation rate and dealing with the competitive depreciation of the exchange rate and the lift in the profit share, are very strong for inflation and for employment.

<PARA> Today we heard the unemployment figures. The figure of 9.2 per cent is horrendous. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said, the Treasurer will probably be known as `Mr Nine Point Two Per Cent', as distinct from the other percentages. However, even more horrendous figures have come out today. On the Country Hour today Mr Robert Bush of the Charles Sturt University came out with some statistics which I think are also extremely bad.</PARA>
<PARA> I bring to the attention of the House that 20 years ago the suicide rate in Australia was about three per 100,000 head of population per annum. The figures were roughly equal in the city and the country. The sad news is that now, 20 years on, the percentage is still three per 100,000 but the rate in rural areas is 21 per 100,000-almost seven times the rate in the city areas. The suicides are mainly young men from 17 to 22. That says something, and it is something that we as a parliament must look into. We must find out what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not naive enough to say that that is the Government's fault, but it does say something about the conditions that people in rural Australia are living under. They have difficulty in getting access to education, they are flat out finding work, and in many cases they are living on the breadline, as some of their city cousins are, but the problems are magnified by living in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, 19 years ago the Whitlam Government came to power. It was probably one of the worst political disasters in our history. It stayed in power for three years. The Fraser Government then came in and tried to hold the line, but the lethargy was there. The drought and the union movement caused the demise of the Fraser Government. Since that time, under this Government we have continued to suffer a decline in our standard of living. We do not have to go very far to see this; even members of this House can tell. We might say that we are the elite of the population, but looking down any street anywhere we will find a general decline in the standard of living-at an ever-increasing rate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no incentive in this country. There is no incentive to work; there is no incentive to invest; and there is no incentive to save. This has been shown by today's unemployment figures. Over the past few months the Government has been trying to divert attention away from the real suffering of Australia, both in the city and in rural areas, with smokescreens such as the ban on political advertising, Aboriginal treaties, the uranium debate and so on. Of course, there are some the Government has not engineered, such as the great arguments going on within the Party, the leadership debate and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Day after day we have heard the Treasurer telling us that everything was okay and that we were on track. This might be okay if we were a banana republic. I do not know about other members here or the Australian public, but I do not want to live in a banana republic. Day after day I ask myself, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised this: how is it that this nation, which has such mineral wealth, such agricultural wealth and such human potential, can get itself into such a mess? How did we get into this mess? The answer is that we elected a Labor government some years ago. That is why we are in this mess. What does this Labor Government do? It looks after its big mates-big corporations, big unions, big governments. That is what it likes. </PARA>

<PARA> My forebears, who were all miners back to my greatgrandfather, would turn in their graves if they knew what this Labor Party was doing. This Labor Party, which once purported to represent the workers of Australia, has sunk to worrying about the establishment of big government, the establishment of big unions and, as I said, the establishment of big business, and not those workers it should be representing. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural Australia has been hit particularly hard. While we can blame low commodity prices, particularly with wool and wheat, in my opinion that problem has not really impacted. Rural Australia is presently reeling under seven years of Labor Government taxes, charges, high interest rates and excises. The list goes on. Syntec Economic Services Pty Ltd, according to the newspapers today, confirms that we have not seen the start of it yet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government and the union movement have effectively stifled the manufacturing sector. For the life of me, I cannot understand why they have almost destroyed the primary industries, which produce the great proportion of wealth in this country. We in the National Party of Australia realise and understand how important those industries are. In coalition with the Liberal Party, we understand that we must do something to keep those people in the bush if we are going to keep this great nation on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> I could give the macro- and micro-economic figures relating to problems being faced, particularly in rural areas, but perhaps a few of the many letters I receive should be brought to the attention of the House. I was rather upset by the condescending nature of the Treasurer's remarks in regard to women and how the coalition views women. It is true that women are under tremendous pressure. I took a random sample of letters from my office, and every one of these letters was from a woman telling me about her family. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a famous saying from the famous poet Charles Kingsley:</PARA>
<PARA>For men must work and women must weep. And there's little to earn and many to keep. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is today. Just to quickly give an indication of what is happening, here we have a letter from a farmer in West Wyalong who started with nothing, built up a farm, and is trying to get a viable living area. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this goal has been progressively getting harder to reach over the past five years, due entirely to Federal Government reliance on high interest rates to curb the balance of payments problem. As I am in the final stages of repaying bank loans on my property and machinery, the interest rates of which were taken out at 10% to 15% respectively and which have risen to as much as 22% . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He announces at the bottom:</PARA>
<PARA>I now face the definite prospect, after 35 years of always meeting bank payments when due, in about three years time, losing all my assets because of my inability to meet bank payments-</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. There is a letter from another lady at Goolgowi:</PARA>
<PARA>As Mr Kerin says we have had two good years before this last disastrous 9 months. Not enough to have enough cash to tide us over for the next 3 years though. First we had to pay tax and provisional tax on those 2 years income, then we payed off a little more of our debt, and did some capital improvements that had been waiting to be done for years. We also had one luxury and went on our first payed family trip . . . for 20 years . . . The bank will carry us this year but what about the next 3 or 4 years???? We both work long hours, we cannot work any harder, we have no man to put off . . . We have had to tell our 17 year old son that he cannot go to University this year-</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. Another letter from Narrandera:</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing to express my concern in regard the present state of our nation's economy, and that of our farmers and small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say how the family has broken up under the tremendous pressures that have been forced onto it by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another letter from Tibooburra says that people cannot afford to send their children to high school; therefore, their children will miss out on high school. There is another one from a trucking company which says that excessive interest rates, fuel prices, taxes on tyres, et cetera, have ruined it. Another letter says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am a country wife and mother of two young sons, my husband has been on the land all his life. He comes from a grazing family which has built all that it has achieved by sheer hard work . . . I would just like to ask your Government-</PARA>
<PARA>this is to Mr Keating, actually-</PARA>
<PARA>what are you going to do to support the huge unemployment bill that will occur with farmers losing their farms-</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. I might add that I know a number of women who have left the farms and gone into cities to work because they have to work to support their husbands on the farms and to get their children into schools in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in the bush, of course, is that some of the smaller communities are losing their infrastructures: we will have a number of ghost towns in rural Australia. I am not saying this to be dramatic; it is a fact. If one goes around these electorates, one sees that. I am worried that in rural Australia we will lose the technical know-how and the managerial skill that we really need to run our farms. I think the whole farming sector will change over the next few years, and I am very worried about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a message for members of this Labor Government or, as many are calling them, the Bollinger champagne socialists: it is not a good life for those who are living in poverty, whether they be in the city or the bush. We in this House get used to the woollen suits, the Commonwealth cars and the finer trappings of life, and it is often an uncomfortable atmosphere for a lot of politicians to mix with and learn from those people whom they are supposed to represent. One would think, with aNiMaLs-the National Media Liaison Office-operating on the Labor Party's side, the Government side, that it would know what is going on. This is what we must do if we are to realise the real hurt that is taking place as a result of Government indecision, whether it be in Mount Druitt or Tibooburra. </PARA>
<PARA> I am calling on the Prime Minister and saying, `Mr Prime Minister, if you lead, we will follow. Forget your factional fights, forget your argument with the Treasurer-he is history anyway. His economic policies have put us in the drain, they have put us in the situation we are in now. Get yourself a new Treasurer; have some guts and some courage to speak out against some of your colleagues and your former colleagues. Let us get on with the job, and let us get this country back on the road'. </PARA>

That is something which he failed to do. I want to look at the record of the Government and I also want to consider the Opposition's performance. There are three critical areas in the economy: fiscal constraints and the fiscal policies that the Government adopts; the monetary policy that the Government adopts; and the wages policy. They are the three arms open to the Government in pursuing economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Where better to start than with the famous newspaper article that quoted the shadow Treasurer in February of this year in the Australian. The headline reads `Reith urges a $3bn spending cut, higher taxes'. A $3 billion tax cut in February this year was the stated policy of the Liberal Opposition, the formula of the shadow spokesperson, for addressing the difficulties confronted by the downturn in the economy, which the Opposition was concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to have too much knowledge of economic management to understand that in times of a downturn the last thing one wants is to withdraw $3 billion out of the economy. That was the prescription that the shadow Treasurer put forward. It is worth quoting a couple of sentences from that article. The shadow Treasurer tried to elucidate the Opposition's policy on taxation and fiscal matters. The article quotes Mr Reith. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reith's clarification of the Opposition's stance on fiscal policy-that it would both increase taxes and would cut spending during a recession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that the author of the article found that as astounding as most of the readers. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Reith would not say yesterday when the Opposition's new tax plan-</PARA>
<PARA>this is clearly an integral part of any fiscal policy-</PARA>
<PARA>would be released, other than that it would be ``all in due course''. </PARA>
<PARA>It is rather reminiscent of the health policy that we remember prior to the last Federal election. I am sure Australian citizens recall the health policy that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) was going to present to the people of Australia-it was all in the top drawer. The figures had been worked out, and we were going to see them. That policy still has not come out of the top drawer. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recall the press conference where the honourable member for Tangney-who now sits on the Opposition's back bench-told the people that the figures did not add up. That policy has not come to light. We have the same approach with economic management: the figures are in the top drawer and the tax plan is in the top drawer. That is what the shadow Treasurer had to say in February this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the Opposition's fiscal responsibility. It does not have a tax policy, but it assures us that it is in the top drawer. As the Opposition has said, we will see it, no doubt, in due course. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reith said the Opposition was concerned about the loosening of fiscal policy (that has taken place) and in our view-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition's view-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a lever that they (the Government) ought to be pulling. </PARA>
<PARA> Tightening fiscal policy would provide some real benefits and it's one of the things, one of the policy prescriptions, that they ought to be employing. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer went on to elucidate his view that the Government should withdraw $3 billion from the economy and that would, in some way, assist Australians in need. In terms of the Opposition's matter of public importance it would reduce any social stress or economic suffering of the Australian people. That is an economic nonsense. To give the honourable member for Bennelong his due-no doubt he has a much better understanding of economics in these matters-he must cringe every time the shadow spokesperson opens his mouth on these matters. To come out with a statement recommending a $3 billion cut in expenditure and an increase in taxation at a time when the economy was in recession is irresponsible. It demonstrates not only a lack of understanding of the basic economics but also a lack of compassion for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiscal responsibility does not only go to those matters. Let us have a look at what the Opposition has done in practice. The shadow Treasurer spoke in tough words and talked about the need for cuts, but let us have a look at what the Opposition has actually done. The Budget Papers records have been kept since 1953. In all those years that we had Liberal governments in this country, not once did they return a surplus in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1953, the only Budget surpluses recorded by the Australian Government are in the last three Budgets returned by the current Treasurer and this Labor Government. For all the tough talking and hypocrisy that we have heard from the Opposition today, not once in its entire period in office did it ever produce a Budget surplus. This Government has done it on three occasions and is the only Government to have done it at all. It is a nonsense for the people opposite to talk about the need for fiscal restraint when, in fact, they have a record which is quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now turn to interest rates. Much has been said about interest rates and the Opposition's policy. Again, the Opposition is not quite sure where it is at. Both the current shadow Treasurer and the former shadow Treasurer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), were not quite certain what to make of interest rates last year, and they have not learned a lot since then. In January last year before the election this Government took steps to reduce interest rates to ease the pressure on the economy and to try to loosen the strings so that there was an injection, an availability, of funds. At the time the Opposition spokesperson, the now Leader of the Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Keating is pushing the pace of interest rate reductions simply to suit his electoral time- table. </PARA>
<PARA>In January 1990 the now Leader of the Opposition argued that we should have kept interest rates higher; that we should not have reduced them. That was his position last year. One would have thought that those opposite would have learned something since then. But only in November last year the current shadow Treasurer, the person who introduced this matter of public importance, went on the record and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I in the end come to the view, yes, if we were loosening off on monetary policy without fiscal changes, then you would end up with higher interest rates. In other words, I would not take the rates off. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the shadow Treasurer said in November last year. In January those opposite criticised us for reducing the rates; in November-only five or six months ago-they still criticised us for bringing down the rates. We have reduced interest rates significantly. In the last 14 months they have come down 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members on the other side of this Parliament want to have it both ways. They criticised us every time we reduced interest rates-from January last year right through to the present. On the one hand, they have criticised the reductions but, on the other hand, they have said that the economy is being stifled. Either they have no understanding of the way the economy works or they are again demonstrating their hypocrisy and duplicity in the way they approach important issues and the way these issues are presented to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite have said something about the 1.5 billion new jobs created. The Opposition's rationale is that this does not count because many of those positions are held by women. Let us consider that. I am glad that the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) is here. He was one of the people upset at the response from this side of the House. Those opposite are saying that if a male fills a job it is okay-it is good employment-but that if a female fills a job we are just forcing women out of the house. That is their logic. It is a disgrace and it is sexist. The honourable member should encourage his colleagues to change their view on that. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other examples could be given of the Opposition's failure to properly address economic issues. Time does not allow me to present them today. In this debate and throughout the economic debate the Opposition has presented dispositions without policies, with pessimism and with a negative hypocrisy. This does nothing for its position or for the country. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report:</PARA>
<PARA> Development of HMAS Albatross, Nowra, NSW, Stage 2</PARA>
<PARA> Following Government approval in 1985 and 1986 to purchase new Seahawk helicopters for the Royal Australian Navy, further development of the naval air station, HMAS Albatross, near Nowra in New South Wales, was prompted. The first stage of this development commenced in 1987 and is now complete. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion now refers to Stage 2 of the development program. Stage 2 will involve provision of a new building to house the command, operations, communications and administration of the naval air station and the provision of a new building to provide office facilities for both technical and administrative staff of No. 723 and No. 817 squadrons. Upgrading of associated hangar annexes, high voltage reticulation and emergency power supply will also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the command, operations, communications and administration functions are conducted from six widely separated buildings, two of which are temporary buildings of World War II design. Technical staff of No. 723 and No. 817 squadron operate from temporary and unsatisfactory accommodation. Squadron administration and air crew operate from old corrugated iron or timber huts which are energy inefficient and noisy and which continually require repair and maintenance. Critical upgrading of the high voltage reticulation system was undertaken in stage 1. With the passage of time, further work has now become necessary. The central emergency power station upgrade will provide a standby power supply to satisfy the current increase in operational requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposed works will compete with current major development projects at HMAS Albatross. The limit of cost estimates for these works is $9.9m at December 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in September 1991, with the completion of the new buildings expected in late 1992. It is also expected that the project will create about 70 jobs in the Nowra area. </PARA>
<PARA> I table selected drawings of the proposed Stage 2 development works at HMAS Albatross. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in order to validate certain recommendations made by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee relating to the payment of Medicare benefits that were not given legal effect through failure to make necessary ministerial determinations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides for the establishment of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to advise the Minister about the contents of the table in the schedule to the Act. This table is known as the medical benefits schedule and is used as the basis for determining the amount of benefits payable under Medicare. A determination made by the Minister on the basis of the Committee's recommendation to vary the schedule requires formal steps to be taken to give legal effect to it. For a period of time these steps were in fact not taken, although Medicare benefits assessment advices were issued, which reflected the advice of the Committee during that period. Such advices were acted upon by the Health Insurance Commission, the public and most pathologists. There is no reason to doubt that the relevant Ministers would have taken steps to legally formalise the determinations had the matters been placed before them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that there was a legislative intent in the Act that the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee would be the source of expert advice and would make a recommendation on any amendment to the medical benefits schedule, including the list of pathology services in the schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The development in the late 1970s of an assay method known as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, as a means of detecting and estimating antigens and antibodies, combined with automation techniques, resulted in considerable savings in the time and cost of doing such estimations. For example, it is possible to estimate antibodies in 96 samples in about one to two minutes using the ELISA test, compared with one to two hours using another comparable technique known as radioimmunoassay. In addition, the reagents for ELISA are inexpensive and have a long shelf life. </PARA>
<PARA> These properties of ELISA made it an extremely attractive method to pathologists as a means of determining a range of antigens and antibodies. The absence of an item for ELISA in the pathology tables of the schedule and its increasing use by pathologists were the impetus for recommendations by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to add the test to items 2294 and 2295 in the medical benefits schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984, acting on the recommendation of the Committee, the Department issued a Medicare benefits assessment advice which specified items 2294 and 2295 for the assay method ELISA. Subsequent advices arising from other recommendations of the Committee were issued from time to time for these items, generally in order to increase the benefits payable for the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The defective amending of items 2294 and 2295 by the use of Medicare benefits assessment advices was thought to have been overcome in 1987 when the Pathology Services Advisory Committee made recommendations to the then Minister, Dr Blewett. These recommendations led to the Minister making determinations under section 4a of the Act to amend the then pathology services table. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of a Federal Court decision in late 1988, the Pathology Services Advisory Committee recommendations were set aside for procedural deficiencies and the Medicare benefit assessment advices defects again became an issue. </PARA>
<PARA> A judgment of the Federal Court in 1990 held that ELISA tests for rubella antibodies fell within item 1345, which is a pathology service attracting a far higher benefit than items 2294 and 2295. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording of pathology items in the schedule reflects the highly technical nature of a large number of the methods used in pathology. The fact that a test procedure, especially a new procedure, may be interpreted to fit the description of a particular item does not necessarily mean that it is the appropriate item for that test. In fact, the vast majority of pathologists did not use item 1345 for ELISA testing because they acknowledge that it was not the correct item. </PARA>
<PARA> Further litigation has raised the prospect that pathologists may be able to claim the difference between the fee paid for a test, the level of which was determined by an advice, and the level of fee payable under item 1345. The possible consequences of this situation are that every person who has been paid for ELISA testing under items other than item 1345 over the past six years will be entitled to recover the difference from the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Since amounts paid for ELISA testing represent reasonable remuneration, as determined by an expert advisory committee, the amendments in this Bill are sought in order to give effect to what was thought to be the position at the time. That was accepted and acted upon by both the vast majority of pathologists and the Health Insurance Commission, and the public, as being the actual right to payment in respect of these tests. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of not making the Medicare benefits assessment advices legally effective will be to create a major danger to revenue by giving pathologists a possible substantial windfall gain of about $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that the purpose of this Bill is to validate the Medicare benefits assessment advices dealing with the ELISA test so that claims and payments made in accordance with them will become valid and proper and to bring the legislation into line with the general practice in fact adopted at that time. All other rights to benefits under the schedule will be preserved and unaffected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the amendments. The proposed amendments to items 1345 and 1346 are consequential and designed to reduce the risk of argument that, notwithstanding the validation of the advices of Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, there is still an obligation to pay under item 1345. The effect of the amendment would be to exclude from item 1345 the quantification of those antigens and antibodies which would be covered by the new items 2294(3), 2294(4), 2295(3) and 2295(4) when performed by the ELISA method. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also proposed to provide for two rules about the application of the schedule. These provide a means of dealing with the proposition that because of the general wording of some of the items in the schedule, the potential exists for a particular test to fall within the literal definition covered by more than one item. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are proposed in order to validate the various Medicare benefits assessment advices with respect to ELISA for the schedules in existence at various times between 1 March 1984 and 1 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed transitional provisions are included in the Bill to preserve the rights to additional payment to persons who, because of the validation of the advices, would be underpaid, and to exclude liability for any additional windfall benefits to pathologists in excess of the amounts specified in the advices. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will repeal Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and substitute a new part III which will contain the provisions relating to the payment of service pensions and associated benefits for veterans, spouses and other dependants as at 1 July 1990. The most important features of the new part III include provisions expressed in `plain English', shorter sections than in the current legislation, and easy to follow structure and layout of provisions, with each category of pension dealt with in a separate division. </PARA>
<PARA> The rewrite of part III does not involve any changes in policy, has no financial impact or effect on veterans' pensions or entitlements, and does not alter in any way the responsibilities of the Repatriation Commission towards the veteran community and their dependants. In this sense, the Bill retains existing legislative provisions as at 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill builds on past achievements in the simplification of repatriation legislation. The introduction of the 1986 Act to consolidate and rationalise the growing body of repatriation legislation in a single document was a major step forward in making that legislation more accessible and easier to understand. In the past five years, however, repatriation legislation has been amended to meet the changing needs of an ageing veteran population and to keep pace with government policy. This has been particularly so in relation to the income and assets tests applying to service pensions under part III. The result has been an unavoidable increase in the complexity of these provisions in repatriation legislation, many of which reflect similar developments in social security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act 1947 has been entirely rewritten in `plain English' and was introduced in Parliament on 6 November 1990. Honourable members will remember that the Social Security Bill 1990 was debated in the second week of the autumn sittings. As with the Social Security Bill 1990, the object of this Bill is to overcome problems associated with understanding legislation by using a `clear English' drafting style and a better format for presenting information. In addition, the introduction of step by step rate calculators consolidates into distinct modules all the provisions relevant to any aspect of the calculation of the rate of pension payable. With such arrangements in place, claimants for a pension or benefit could also work out their rate of pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant feature of the Bill is the repeal of the current section 5 and its replacement by a new section 5, still located in part I of the 1986 Act, which contains an index to all the definitions used in the Act, while new sections 5a to 5r contain the definitions arranged by subject group. For example, all the war and operational area related definitions are contained under that heading in a new section 5b. These definitions relate to the type and nature of service performed, the areas and the periods of service. These definitions are important in assisting veterans to understand the way these terms are used when determining their entitlement to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The rewrite of part III has been undertaken in consultation with the ex-service organisations which have been involved from the outset in its planning and organisation. In November last year an exposure draft of the partially completed Bill was provided to these organisations for examination of, and comment on, the content and format of the new part III. The comments received have been both constructive and helpful in redrafting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, extensive consultation has taken place with key representatives of the major ex-service organisations. Comments and suggestions for further improvement arising out of this consultative round have been incorporated into the final Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the 1986 Act introduced in the 1990 Budget sittings and any amendments introduced during the current sittings, together with transitional arrangements, will be covered in separate Bills to be introduced later in these sittings. There will be ongoing consultation with the ex-service organisations in respect of the rewrite amendment Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents a significant advance in making legislation more accessible to an ageing veteran community. It is in line with the trend towards `plain English' as the preferred form of expression in official documents. It is in line with the access and equity policy of this Government. Last but not least, this Bill goes a long way towards meeting the call for simpler legislation by both the ex-service and war widows organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, considerable effort has been made in completing this Bill to pave the way for more effective administration. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments do not reflect major changes in policy by the Government. The Export Control Act sets up a regime for the export inspection of prescribed goods. These goods include meat, fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy produce and grains. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure that the goods which are to be exported meet the strict requirements set out in the orders made pursuant to the regulations under the Act. These requirements are aimed at ensuring fitness for human consumption, quality and accurate trade description of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes a serious view of malpractice in the export food industry. Any malpractice that may endanger the reputation of our export industries and jeopardise overseas markets for Australian goods must be strongly deterred. Accordingly these amendments include the introduction of two new offences into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of the Bill introduces an offence of falsely representing, at the time of entering goods for export, that conditions or restrictions applicable to those goods have been complied with. The representation is made to an authorised officer, who is usually an officer performing inspection services. The phrase `enter for export' is defined in clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This offence is introduced because many goods which are controlled by the Act are prepared without the direct supervision of an authorised officer. The exporter of those goods may enter the goods for export only if the goods have met the conditions or restrictions that were applicable to the preparation of those goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The offence has three elements. First, prescribed goods must be presented to an authorised officer for the purpose of the authorised officer performing his function under section 10 of the Act. That function is to ensure that the conditions or restrictions applicable to the goods have been complied with. A presentation to an officer at that officer's request will be a presentation for the purposes of this element. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element is that the presentation must occur at a prescribed stage of the preparation of the goods. Given that there are different inspection processes for different commodities it will be necessary to prescribe stages of preparation that are suitable for each commodity. Hence there are particular stages of preparation at which goods which exporters wish to enter for export must have complied with the conditions or restrictions applicable to those goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The third element is that there is a false representation that the conditions or restrictions applicable to the goods at or before the time the goods were entered for export have been complied with. This need not be an express representation. It is sufficient that it is by necessary implication because in the normal course of inspecting goods it is not common for the exporter to expressly state that the goods have complied with prior restrictions or conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second offence created by this Bill is set out in clause 15. That clause amends section 24 of the Act by inserting an offence of authorised officers receiving goods or services from the owner of a registered export establishment without written permission of the Secretary. Section 24 of the Act currently prohibits an exporter providing goods or services to an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers. I must particularly stress the importance of the integrity of inspection staff in the food industry. Lack of integrity on their behalf will jeopardise valuable export markets for Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 of the Bill introduces a new section 23 into the Act. Section 23 provides for the Secretary to issue health or fitness for human consumption certificates. Such certificates are usually required to be provided by the exporter to the importing country before that country will allow goods to be imported. In addition the certificates are also used for commercial purposes by the exporters even where there is no importing country requirement, for example, to obtain payment for their goods. Accordingly, to facilitate export trade, this amendment makes it clear that such certificates may also be granted where the certificate relates to requirements of the Act or to other matters concerning goods of the kind that are to be exported. </PARA>
<PARA> An express power to cancel such a certificate is included where the Secretary becomes aware that the information attested to in the certificate is incorrect in a significant respect. Other amendments in this Bill follow current criminal law policy by omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. Section 4b of the Crimes Act 1914 will operate and for each 12 months of imprisonment provided for in the Export Control Act, a court may impose a monetary penalty of up to $6,000 for individuals or five times that amount for corporations. This obviates the need to amend the Act when policy as to the relativity between gaol terms and monetary penalties changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The training guarantee requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. It was established by legislation introduced into this House almost 12 months ago, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. The scheme was introduced by the Government in recognition of the pressing need for more and better quality training in Australia, to equip us with the highly skilled and flexible work force we urgently need in order to compete in the international marketplace. The training guarantee is a carefully constructed measure aimed at improving the training effort of businesses which did not, before its introduction, invest in training, or invested very little. Firms which already recognise the value of training and train above the required minimum level are affected very little. </PARA>
<PARA> An important objective of the training guarantee is to change industry attitudes towards training. For too long, many firms have regarded training as a cost to be minimised rather than as an investment from which they can expect measurable returns. Even firms which train their staff in times of economic buoyancy are inclined to jettison their training effort first in times of economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> The training guarantee is designed to make our nation's training effort stronger, in terms of both quantity and quality, more equitable, so that `good' trainers are not disadvantaged by having their trained staff poached by `bad' trainers, and more consistent, so that at least a minimum amount of training is undertaken every year, and that economic recovery is not jeopardised by skill shortages. </PARA>
<PARA> The training guarantee has been in force only since 1 July 1990, so it is too early to make conclusive statements about the changes it has wrought in practice or attitude. The Australian Bureau of Statistics training expenditure survey, which is due to be released later this month, will provide the first conclusive data on changes in employer expenditure. A quarterly survey conducted in New South Wales, however, by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the State Bank indicates that 45 per cent of employers surveyed had increased their training expenditure in the September 1990 quarter, and that more than 90 per cent had training plans in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Anecdotal evidence also indicates that there is a much greater level of interest in training among the business community than has been the case in the past. Certainly my office and my Department have received many inquiries about the scheme, and great interest has been shown in the registered industry training agent concept. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 to give effect to undertakings made by the Government in relation to outstanding trainers and to fees charged by industry training agents. It clarifies the intentions of the original legislation in several regards and makes some minor technical amendments to the provisions. It also makes provision for the recognition of alternative training levy schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> During my second reading speech on the original training guarantee legislation, I mentioned the useful contribution made, during the process of consultation and development, by the Australian Democrats. I particularly mentioned their suggestions in relation to registered industry training agents and to the possibility of exemptions from the provisions of the Act for employers who are outstanding trainers. This Bill will enable the establishment of a system to exempt outstanding trainers from the provisions of the Act. It provides that regulations may be made which allow the Minister, among other things, to establish criteria against which the training effort of applicant employers may be measured, in order to award them outstanding trainer status. </PARA>
<PARA> The recognition of outstanding trainers will be a positive acknowledgment that some employers are committed to training and well exceed the minimum requirements of the Act. At the same time, it provides an incentive for other employers to achieve this status. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria, to be set by regulation, have been the subject of consultation with employer representatives and unions. Honourable members may recall that the Prime Minister announced, in his 12 March economic statement, that in order to achieve outstanding trainer status, and to qualify for exemption from the provisions of the Training Guarantee Act, employers will need to spend at least 5 per cent of payroll on quality structured training. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a system of registered industry training agents-now known as RITAs, by way of acronym-was provided for in the original Training Guarantee (Administration) Act. This Bill makes some amendments to the way the system operates on the basis of suggestions made to us by the National Training Board, by industry and, indeed, by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. For example, the Bill allows RITAs and the training advisory body to charge fees on application for a certificate rather than, as in the original legislation, only when a certificate is issued. This amendment allows RITAs to charge a fee to recover their costs when a training program is assessed and found to be not an eligible training program and a certificate is refused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill clarifies the status of RITAs while they are performing services for employers and issuing training advisory certificates. The Bill states that both RITAs and the training advisory body are, in this context, not agents of the Commonwealth. The provisions ensure that those bodies may charge fees in their own right. Additional flexibility has been provided in fee setting to allow RITAs to set fees according to circumstances. Rather than providing for a fixed amount, the Bill allows fees to be set on a sliding scale up to a maximum of $500. That maximum amount is automatically indexed. A provision has also been inserted which allows the training advisory body to deregister a RITA which overcharges. The Bill makes absolutely clear that RITAs are covered by the existing secrecy provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces two changes to the wording of the section which deals with the definition of `eligible training programs'. The first specifies that training programs which are not designed by a person with appropriate qualifications must be approved by such a person, in advance of their delivery. This was, in fact, the intention of the original legislation but was not specifically stated. The second tightens the clause on objects of training programs and, in effect, ensures that an eligible training program has no significant object which is not training related. At the same time, the amendment ensures that structured on the job training with an unavoidable production element, which is otherwise eligible, will still be eligible training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill widens the definition of related companies who may elect to group, for training guarantee purposes, and to be treated as a single employer. Such an election has advantages in terms of record keeping and reporting, and this amendment will benefit certain corporations such as Commonwealth and State instrumentalities which were previously prevented from participating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill inserts provisions into the Act which restate the situation in relation to partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts, to make clear on whom obligations fall, and by whom they may be discharged. New provisions relating to offences have been included which ensure that action can be easily taken in the event of a failure to fulfil obligations. It is also made clear that obligations are determined on a partnership by partnership, association by association or trust by trust basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides the basis for alternative training levy schemes to be recognised. Some industries or industry sectors have expressed interest to me in implementing their own training levy schemes as an alternative to the training guarantee. I have, in fact, indicated my willingness to consider such approaches on the basis of a number of conditions, not the least of which is the amount of money which will, as a normal result of an alternative scheme, be spent on eligible training. It is possible for an industry to be exempted from the provisions of the training guarantee under existing legislation. This amendment, however, provides a more flexible basis for the regulation of such schemes for the benefit of industries which prefer to be responsible for their own training needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary then, this Bill introduces some new aspects to the training guarantee in response to good ideas and suggestions which the Government has received since the scheme's inception. It also makes some amendments to current provisions to facilitate the administration of the training guarantee and to ensure that it achieves its objectives. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill have been made by the Senate, on the motion of the Government and with the support of Opposition senators. The amendments make some minor alterations to capital gains tax changes proposed by the Bill and result from representations made to the Government and following consultation with the Opposition. The amendments do not change the substance of the Bill and impose no additional obligations on taxpayers. They will apply from the date of introduction of the Bill, 6 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the amendments to clause 44 of the Bill will ensure that no double tax can arise on the disposal of a partner's interest in a partnership asset; and amendments to clause 57 will also ensure that an individual partner can obtain roll-over relief on the transfer of an interest in a partnership to a company wholly owned by the partner. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the other amendment will limit the operation of new anti-avoidance rules proposed by clause 61 which apply where an asset is transferred between companies under common ownership for actual consideration less than the asset's indexed cost base. The amendment will ensure that no cost base adjustments will be made to genuine third party loans which are not reduced in value as a result of the assets transfer. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be useful in this discussion to put the history of these amendments into some sort of context and, in doing so, to reflect on matters raised in debate in the House, before the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill was transmitted to the Senate for its consideration and acceptance some time after 13 February, I think. The Bill itself is an omnibus Bill and, therefore, it involved multiple amendments; and those amendments were across a range of taxation provisions. The provisions to be amended were in two or three Acts of Parliament. You can imagine, Mr Deputy Chairman, how complex those amendments were-and you would have some first-hand knowledge, from your day-to-day work as a representative if not as a deputy chairman of committees, of the complexity of the income tax Acts intended to be amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reading debate resumed at about 11 a.m. on 13 February, approximately half an hour after we were presented with six pages of amendments to this amending Bill. We were, as legislators, thereby expected to discuss intelligently the Bill, having been confronted with these further and even more complex-if that is possible-changes. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee was formed on the same afternoon, at about quarter past four, the amendments were moved by the Minister then at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), without any comment or explanation. For your information, Mr Deputy Chairman, what we had was something not unlike what we are considering now-a page cryptically listing changes to words and lines-and, of course, in that form, impossible to consider with any diligence. There were six pages of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We complained of course, as you can imagine, Mr Deputy Chairman, about the absence of this information, and I did so in commencing my remarks in the committee stage. The Minister on duty-not the Minister at the table now, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who had carriage of the legislation, but the Minister for Land Transport-interjected to offer to provide the information. </PARA>
<PARA> That information included-unbeknown to me at the time he made his interjection, and certainly it was not included in any information he offered the Opposition-an explanatory memorandum. To present in the committee stage of a Bill an explanatory memorandum intended to explain the details of amendments to legislation already under consideration is a device or a technique which I have never come across before in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> There you might picture it, Mr Deputy Chairman: we were very close to winding up the debate in the committee stage when suddenly we were at last given vital information, information which we had been denied either by intent or by the incompetence of the Government and each of the Ministers to whom I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that a memorandum was required at all is evidence in itself of the complexity and import of the amendments. As I said, the presentation in the committee stage of a Bill of an explanatory memorandum intended to explain the details of amendments to legislation already under consideration is rare and probably has never happened before in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> With ten minutes of speaking time left available to me, and with carriage of the measure on behalf of the Opposition, it was left to me to discuss these further amendments to the amending Bill. Before my speaking time was about to expire, the Minister tabled the explanatory memorandum and in doing so recited excerpts from the second reading speech of the Minister who had carriage of the measure but who was not in the chamber. Those excerpts had nothing at all to do with what he had just presented the Committee with. On a minute's notice, discussion on six pages of further changes were expected to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that that is impossible; it places in an impossible situation people in this House who seek to take their responsibilities seriously. The consequence of all that is, of course, that those latter amendments were never properly considered by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the time, having been made aware of that circumstance, it was inevitable that this Bill had to come back. It is not the first time that has happened, of course, because on too many occasions the Government, often under the guillotine, denies this House the opportunity to consider legislation. Nowhere has that been more apparent than with some complex taxation legislation in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA> It transpired, of course, that in the Senate, with the diligent attention of Senator Watson on behalf of the Opposition, some 13 questions were able to be asked and answers obtained to them. Consultation with the responsible Minister in that chamber was possible, and that was a sensible way of going about debating legislation-that is, sensible if we want to make the legislation work in the way in which the Government says it intends it to work. </PARA>
<PARA> But that simply does not happen here. As I say, the answers to Senator Watson's questions were accepted, and now we have the inevitable further changes before the Committee. I put it to the Minister and to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that that is absolutely unnecessary and that it is a further indication not just of the Government's ineptitude in the way it manages as a government of this country but also of the way that it handles the legislation on which it must rely for authority to govern. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is showing all the signs of tiredness, and although we do not oppose these amendments now before the Committee, I want honourable members opposite to know that we object in the strongest terms to the way they go about legislating in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Opposition is accepting the amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, so I will not take too much of the time of the Committee, but it is appropriate that on behalf of the Government I respond to the points that have been made because I think that in a number of respects they are valid. The circumstances which led to the events which have been complained about were that this legislation originally was brought into the House in December of last year and lay on the table to enable some industry representations and to enable some points to be made about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments that were brought back into the House when this matter was debated again in February resulted from those consultations, and, whilst it is not unusual to have additional or supplementary explanatory memorandums to explain the detail and the reasons for those amendments-indeed, it is quite appropriate-the problem that occurred on this occasion was not that the amendments had not been circulated in advance of the debate but that the explanatory memorandum had not. For that I apologise, but it is a fact and it is something that obviously needs to be attended to in future circumstances to ensure that it does not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept entirely that, if there is expected to be reasoned consideration by members of the Opposition to the amendments that are proposed, they need time to consider them. We were under the impression that the amendments had been circulated-which, in fact, they had been-but the explanation of them had not been. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the criticism in that regard. I think that it is not only entitled to be made, but is something we have to look to in the future to ensure that it does not happen again. </PARA>

<PARA> Just in case the Minister said something which might have been misunderstood and which he did not intend, I want to put the facts of the circulating of these further amendments a little more clearly. The amendments were made available to us at 10.30 of the morning of the debate. I think I started my speech in the second reading debate at about 11 o'clock that morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking of the amendments to the amending Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill; that is what we have just been talking about. I received those at 10.30, with no prior advice at all. We got to the committee stage at some time mid-afternoon, about 4.15 or thereabouts, and, as the Minister knows and as he correctly acknowledges, we had not received the explanatory memorandum then. </PARA>
<PARA> So we did have it for about seven hours. I put it to the Minister-and I am sure he is aware of it-that that time was totally inadequate, because there were six pages of amendments. It was not quite as he explained it, and I wanted to put that into some sort of order. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before us today has been returned to this chamber following detailed consideration in the Senate, particularly in the Senate Standing Committee for Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I wish to thank honourable senators and, in particular, that Committee for their keen interest in and constructive comment on the Bill. I also wish to thank the many witnesses who at short notice provided comments which the Committee and the Government found valuable in their deliberations on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was refined in a number of respects on the basis of practical considerations raised during the Committee hearings. Section 23c has been amended to clarify that the effect of the provisions is not in any way to affect or extend the powers of law enforcement officers to arrest suspects. It also puts beyond doubt that the power to detain for an investigation period can only be triggered by a lawful arrest for a Commonwealth offence. Proposed subsection 23c (4) (a) makes it clear that in determining a time for the purposes of proposed section 23c, the number and complexity of matters being investigated are relevant considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made for dead time to include a reasonable period for rest and recuperation, and other minor amendments to 23c (6) have been made to put beyond any doubt that the time taken to arrange for an interpreter is also to be regarded as dead time. Proposed section 23d has been amended to ensure that an extension of application in relation to the investigation period can only be dealt with by a justice of the peace if neither magistrates nor court employed justices of the peace are available. Proposed subsection 23g (3) (b) was amended to make it clear that a legal practitioner present during an interview is entitled to give legal advice whether that advice is solicited or not. Proposed section 23h has been amended to provide that where an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander is a suspect and does not have an interview friend, the investigating official is obliged to notify an Aboriginal legal aid service. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, proposed section 23r has been amended to put beyond doubt that not only does the Bill not confer any power of arrest, but also that it does not authorise detention of a person other than as a consequence of lawful arrest. In my view this was already beyond doubt. However, as the matter was raised in evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, it was thought prudent to specifically spell this out. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Chairman, I present the revised explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This after- noon I represent the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in his capacity as the shadow Attorney-General. The Opposition accepts the amendments that have been moved. We draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that the amendments the Government is now moving incorporate a number of suggestions arising from discussions both in this chamber and in the Senate. Some of the suggestions have arisen from the Government itself, some from the Liberal and National parties and some from the Australian Democrats. The amendments do improve the legislation, but I wish to draw two points to the attention of the chamber. Firstly, in the second reading and committee debates in this chamber, the shadow Attorney-General drew the attention of honourable members to his concerns about the extent of consultations that had taken place in relation to the development of the proposals contained in this Bill. In his speech at the second reading stage he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I find somewhat astonishing the suggestion that the Attorney, as the first law officer of the land, would contemplate introducing a Bill of this type, containing the far-reaching reforms that it does, without obtaining the views of the law enforcement agencies which will be responsible for its administration. </PARA>
<PARA>He put that in the light of earlier Government commitments that there would be full and detailed consultation. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) did not answer that question in the debate in this chamber, but it is quite clear that the shadow Attorney-General's views were vindicated, because this matter was canvassed when the issues were before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to which the Attorney-General has referred. We simply draw the attention of the Attorney to this and express our concern that in future legislation when commitments for full and effective consultations are given, they do in fact take place and that if they do not or if there is any limitation on them, the concerns of the Opposition should be acknowledged here in this chamber as well as later, if appropriate, before the Senate or its committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point to which I wish to refer is that while we agree to the amendments, we draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that we have concerns of fundamental principle. The legislation, though better than when originally proposed, still has within it fixed time requirements, whereas the Opposition proposed that those particular fixed time requirements should be replaced by a reasonableness test requirement. In government the Liberal and National parties would review the operation of the legislation and it is our disposition, as we see it at the moment, to amend the legislation to bring into it the test of reasonableness in place of fixed time requirements that currently exist. As I pointed out, we would review the legislation's operation. As we see it at the present time, our view that there should be a reasonableness test rather than fixed time requirements will be warranted, but we will make that decision when the opportunity presents for us to initiate amending legislation to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991 amends the principal Act so that the duty on uranium concentrate exported from the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory is increased from $1.15 to $1.30 per kilogram. It is a significant measure and one which goes, in a sense, to the heart of the uranium debate and the uranium measures that are being canvassed before the Parliament and the nation. The Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) is the direct user of the funds raised from the levy proposed in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in this context that I place on notice the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and others that the Liberal and National parties will be moving in the proper way an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. Those left wing members and Ministers will be given the chance to vote with their consciences for or against the amendment and to stake their claim at this early stage on day two of the formal debate within the Australian Labor Party (ALP), following on the recommendation of the committee of the Labor Party to proceed with an expanded uranium policy and, indeed, with uranium enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that between now and the special conference of the Labor Party there is going to be a wide-ranging debate in the community at large. The Left will continue to go berserk on the issue and Ministers will continue to speak up on the issue, way outside their particular portfolios. There will be an interesting test later this day, on this Bill and on our amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, to see which way honourable members who have said elsewhere that they have very strong views on this matter will go. </PARA>
<PARA> The duty involved in the legislation was imposed by the previous coalition Government in 1980 in recognition of the special costs incurred by the Commonwealth for environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. According to the Government, the increased rate of duty reflects its position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne, as far as practicable, by the industry carrying out that mining activity and not by the ordinary taxpayer. It is the Office of the Supervising Scientist that carries out the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the principle of user pays, and it is only right that the users of the OSS should pay for its operation. However, at the moment, through the Government's ridiculous and illogical three-mines policy, to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), almost the entire burden of the duty falls on just one company. Under a coalition government there will be no impediment, other than the necessary environmental controls, to the Koongarra and Jabiluka mines and Coronation Hill sharing the burden with Ranger and creating significant export dollars for Australia in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we would lift the three-mine policy. We have a clear-cut policy on this matter. We are often being challenged by the Government about the coalition's policy on this and other issues such as interest rates and so forth. We have the policy across the board. On uranium we have had a specific policy for a considerable length of time. It has stood the test of time, and now the right wing of the Labor Party and its internal committee is moving towards it, tentative step by tentative step. </PARA>
<PARA> Since it now appears likely, given the outspoken comments of various senior members of the Labor Party in recent months and the recommendation of the Party committee yesterday, that the three-mines policy may be overturned at the June conference of the ALP, I can only urge that this be done as soon as possible and that the Government be aware of the need to lower the rate of duty when other mines begin to export from the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The duty provides approximate cost recovery for the operation of the OSS, which has an appropriation of around $7m per year. However, the duty raised only $4m in 1989-90. With the proposed increase in the rate of duty, the total duty recovered is expected to be $7.2m in 1990-91. This will provide a small surplus to balance the low return in the previous year. I seek confirmation from the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, and from the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is responsible for this Bill, that the mere adjustment from $1.15 to $1.30 will raise some extra $3.2m, according to the comments in the second reading speech. Presumably the answer relates to the fact that there will be an increased volume of uranium sales which happen to fall into 1990-91, but any additional confirmation and explanation that can be given on this would be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> While the duty is raised only on operating mines in the region, the OSS provides services to other organisations and is of potential benefit to mines that will begin operation in the future. Therefore, the funding structure for the OSS should comprise appropriate payments from all users. I am aware that the Government is looking into this matter, but I consider it necessary that it be addressed as soon as possible, and in the context of the possible abolition of the absurd three uranium mines policy of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission, in a recent draft report, recommended that charges to cover environmental monitoring be levied on all users of the region. On the three-mines policy, I add that there is no legislation giving effect to the Government's restriction to three uranium mines. This important restriction on industry and exports has not even been brought before the scrutiny of the Parliament for proper debate. The Government achieves expression of this current policy in an almost underhand way: by export controls which are not open to scrutiny and consideration in a direct way by the representatives of the Australian people elected to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The injustice of this duty in falling on one company because of the Government's absurd three-mines policy is only highlighted by the fact that uranium prices are falling and the market is depressed. Yet Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), the operator of the Ranger mine, must compete in the international market, a market which does not suffer the same tax on its products. The three-mines policy must go now-and swiftly-so that when the upturn in the uranium market comes, as projections by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy have forecast, Australia is able to gain its appropriate market share. The market share should be considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has 30 per cent of the world's low cost reserves of uranium but only 10 per cent of the market. Canada, on the other hand, has only 10 per cent of the world's low cost reserves of uranium, yet it enjoys 30 per cent of the market. With the current mismanagement of export industries and external debt by the Government, it is imperative that the three-mines policy go now so that potential mines, including world class deposits in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and elsewhere, can obtain export contracts and be opened up and developed in the interests of the standard of living of all Australians; but equally in accordance with the international safeguards and with proper environmental guidelines being complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes in the rate of this duty are achieved by an extraordinarily complex process. In brief, a gazette item is published, followed by a customs tariff proposal being introduced into Parliament. This allows the new rate of duty to be collected, although the customs tariff proposal must be backed up by legislation such as the Bill under consideration. The customs tariff proposal will lapse if legislation is not passed within 12 months or if Parliament is dissolved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present case, a previous customs tariff proposal for the rate increase now under consideration lapsed at the end of the last Parliament. Accordingly, the companies concerned will have over $200,000 returned to them, being duty paid at the higher rate until the end of the last Parliament. Usually if there is an outstanding customs tariff proposal when the intention to dissolve Parliament is known, a validation Bill is passed in the last days of the Parliament. However, it was decided not to recall Parliament to pass a validation Bill, so the Government became liable for a refund claim from the companies paying the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> This tortuous and often lengthy process means that at any time there is usually a rate alteration tracking slowly along its bureaucratic path to fruition. Occasionally, two of these proposals overlap, as has occurred previously. It is not just the duty on uranium exports that is altered in this way. I understand that all customs and customs tariff proposals follow something like this complex path-a path so complex that the Government has had to refund a good deal of money because the process was interrupted by dissolution of the last Parliament. In one sense, the Government could have sought to make the Bill retrospective to 1 July 1989, in which case no refund would have been payable. The coalition certainly would have opposed that type of approach, as we opposed a similar provision in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In that case, BHP and Esso had paid excise at the particular rate, unaware that a technical error in legislation made them liable only for a lower rate of excise. The Government retrospectively legislated to remove the error, and in so doing obstructed the course of justice, since the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) was in the process of reaching a decision on the dispute at the time. This was a blatant act whereby the Government interfered with the processes of the body properly empowered to consider the dispute, namely, the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA> If anything, the Government's case for applying the same principle here and backdating the legislation so that no refund of duty is due is as strong as for the Excise Tariff Amendment Act 1990. Yet the Government appears to have accepted the validity of the coalition's argument relating to that previous Act, and has on this occasion adopted a more responsible course of action. Although one must feel some incredulity at the complex process which failed and requires the Government to refund the duty, I am glad to see that the Government has seen the weight behind the coalition's previous arguments with regard to that previous episode. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist, as the body expending the funds appropriated by the duty, must be both efficient in its work and must perform appropriate work. The most recent review of the OSS, the Taylor review, was tabled in Parliament in December 1989, and the Government has still not responded. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recommendations of the review was the transferral of staff from Bondi in Sydney to the Northern Territory. Although I understand that there may be problems in recruiting appropriate staff to work there, it is ludicrous that the Government has not yet acted on this recommendation. I understand the complexities involved, but it was a firm recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's inaction on this issue and the provision of a response to the Taylor review inevitably brings into question its seriousness and competency in providing appropriate reform of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. It is still happily located at Bondi Junction, and recently, in Easter week, I called by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, identified myself, and met some of its personnel. We discussed issues of mutual interest in a correct way. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I still believe the Office of the Supervising Scientist should not be at Bondi Junction. It is a long way from the Northern Territory, from the Kakadu National Park, and from the Alligator Rivers region to which its work directly relates. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the OSS with people with an association with it, it is possible to hear just about every available view from complete support for, to complete frustration with, its operation. But it is relevant to note that the Taylor review found some serious inadequacies in its performance, including the lack of a published research plan and the lack of published environmental standards to guide the mining industry in its operations. These two items would seem to be absolutely basic to the credible functioning of the OSS, and the Government has to be condemned for failing to respond to the Taylor review in a sensible time frame so that these reforms would have had Government backing. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet again, the Industry Commission in its recent draft report on its Inquiry into Mining and Minerals Processing in Australia found that there were substantial problems in the administration of mining activity in the Alligator Rivers region due to overlapping responsibilities held by the OSS and the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. There is no point in commissioning reviews which arrive at significant findings such as these if the Government does not act upon those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has highlighted some serious flaws in the Government's policies, including in fact the underlying absurdity of the three-mines policy, the tortuous process by which the duty alterations are made, and the disgraceful failure to implement effective reform in the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to add in that context that, having weighed the pros and cons of this legislation and having considered the frustration of some of the people directly involved with the operation of the OSS, the Opposition has decided, nevertheless, not to oppose this Bill but indeed to place the OSS on notice and to continue our policy review with regard to the OSS and the way it is funded to see whether there are better methods of achieving the same result. </PARA>
<PARA> In this process, of course, I might add, much of the difficulty associated with this legislation and the complaints of ERA and others flow from that one simple fact that we have had now, for many years, under the Hawke Labor Government, an artificial, illogical, irrational three-mines policy relating to the export of uranium. That is the core problem with this legislation before the House, and of course it is a massive difficulty for the mining industry and for Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say that I welcome the progress which is being made, however painstakingly, within the forums of the Government and the Labor Party following on the release of the committee report which yesterday recommended not only that the three-mines policy be lifted, but in fact that it be as well that the Government consider proceeding with uranium enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA> This has perhaps come about to some extent by the U-turn done on the issue by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who has a portfolio responsibility as well in respect of this issue. The Minister has changed his position and argued that there is potential for increased uranium demand as we move through the decade of the 1990s. I would add to that that there is indeed considerable potential for an upswing in the demand for uranium and I warn that, unless Australia moves swiftly, we will miss the boat. </PARA>
<PARA> The new generation of nuclear reactors in the Northern Hemisphere, some of them known as light water reactors, will come on-stream towards the end of the decade of the 1990s and into the first part of the next century, but of course the signing of contracts for that uranium supply required for this new generation of nuclear reactors will be done several years ahead. This means that Australia has a very narrow window of opportunity to bite the bullet on uranium, or completely miss the boat. </PARA>
<PARA> I warn the Parliament and the House of Representatives that they should listen on this one occasion to the submission of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and move swiftly. At the same time they should ignore the protestations of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Phillip and others, who, of course, have shown no capacity to do other than argue for the total closure of the uranium industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Closure would result in throwing out of work many of the miners in the Northern Territory and elsewhere; it would throw out of work many of the people in the service industries which relate to the uranium mining industry; and it would simply add to that horrific set of employment and unemployment statistics released this morning which shows the real state of Australia, the extent of the recession. Yet we have the Left in this hopelessly divided Government continuing to argue that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that the second reading amendment which I propose to move shortly and which I know will be seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) is such that it gives the right wing-including the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice)-the chance to vote for what they are arguing, that is, the review of the whole legislative and policy framework applying to the uranium industry, with a view to lifting swiftly the Government's three-mines policy concerning the export of uranium, noting the huge potential loss of export income with the onward three-mines policy and the damaging effect on Australia's international reputation as a fair and responsible trading nation caused by the continuation of the three-mines policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Hinkler: `This is your chance to vote where your beliefs are'. This is the chance for the right wing to vote where its beliefs are, and to vote for this particular amendment. I concede that the honourable member for Phillip, in her graciousness and in line with her deeply held beliefs on this matter, will of course be quite consistent in voting against the measure. But it is the other members of the Government, the right wing members of the Government, who have nailed their colours to the masthead to argue for the lifting of the three-mines policy. Here is their test on this particular amendment in respect of this Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill. It is now or never. </PARA>
<PARA> They could kick the debate along enormously if they were to vote for this amendment, which would mean that the House had made a declaratory expression of support for what the Prime Minister is arguing for. All I am asking is that they support their Prime Minister's stated position with regard to this policy. In answer to my question in October he said on the floor of the House that in fact the existing uranium policy, the three-mines policy, is illogical. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Government's chance to respond to this challenge, to take the opportunity since the committee reported yesterday-this will cause some heartburn to Peter Milton-and vote accordingly on the key amendment which we will be moving to the Bill before the House. I say again that this is important legislation. This legislation is running late. We are getting used to this Government producing late running legislation with regard to the Office of the Supervising Scientists' levies under the uranium concentrate export duty arrangements. By way of passing, the rent resources tax legislation, the Bass Strait budget deal, was announced last August. It involved some very difficult and complex decisions particularly with the Victorian gas industry, yet here we are in the April sittings of Parliament and we still have not seen this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been advised that that legislation is likely to be introduced on 9 May. The coalition will have 72 hours over a weekend to resolve its position on a massive piece of legislation involving a whole set of new definitions, it will be rushed through the lower House to beat the Senate cut-off date and will then be dealt with in the Senate. So we have a log-jam of legislation emerging. This Budget decision, announced last August, has direct implications for Geelong and other parts of Victoria, especially the gas users in that area. Yet there has been neither sight nor sound of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is late. We will not oppose the legislation, but we will seek to amend it. I invite those people who have given their consideration to the issue of uranium, including members of the Right, to take the opportunity to vote the way their Prime Minister has spoken and vote for this amendment. Government members will be moving swiftly towards their conference debate. They will be enhancing their changes in the conference debate towards a proper decision: namely, the abolition of Labor's three-mine policy. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to review the whole legislative and policy framework applying to the uranium industry, with a view to lifting the Government's `three mines' policy concerning the export of uranium, noting-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), but certainly support the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1991. I am very pleased to speak on this Bill. In fact, when I first came to Parliament in 1987 one of the first Bills that I spoke on in the old House was a Bill similar to this in regard to changing the levy in the Alligator Rivers region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate from $1.15 to $1.30 is effective from 21 February 1990. It covers the uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill provides an exemption from the increased levy where uranium concentrate was loaded onto a vessel or was part of a consignment. The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, is imposed partially to offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect this region. The Alligator Rivers region is part of the greater Kakadu region. We, as a government, are concerned about ensuring that we provide the right mechanisms and infrastructure to preserve this unique area of our nation and at the same time with modern technology to ensure that we are able to extract valuable resources such as uranium for export. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the level of the levy reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment should be basically borne by the companies that are making a profit. I see nothing wrong with that. I do not believe that taxpayers should be subsidising a large company that is making profits out of our natural resources for which Australians fought and died to protect. In preserving the environment, this Bill is one of the best Bills that I have had the pleasure to speak on. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this area includes the Kakadu National Park and requires special measures to preserve it. The operation and research are undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist and other Commonwealth agencies. In addition, funds are provided for services by agencies of the Northern Territory Government on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of national codes of practice relevant to the nuclear materials involves safety, health, mining regulations and environmental monitoring. As I have said, the costs of these services are offset by contributions from the Commonwealth in the annual revenue grant to the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region was introduced by the coalition Government in 1980. In every subsequent year there have been changes to increase the amount to cover the costs. Of course, the proposed increased duty raised an additional $0.22m during 1989-90 and is expected to raise an additional $9.32m over the full 1990-91 financial year. In the 1989-90 financial year, the levy raised $4.007m between July and February. In the 1990-91 financial year, $6.146m has been raised by the levy. Based on current projected exports it is expected that a further $1.066m will be raised during the March-June period. This gives an estimated total amount of revenue raised during the 1990-91 financial year of $7.212m. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker, the Leader of the National Party of Australia, said that by introducing a levy or a duty on any new mines that were to be opened we would be able to bring down the overall cost or charge that comes across existing mining. I do not necessarily see that as the case, because to maintain and ensure that we have the right environmental controls all miners would have to pay at least the amount that the present mine in the Alligator River region is paying. While I fully support the mining of uranium, I believe that we have to maintain the best safeguards to ensure that our environment is protected. With commonsense and goodwill we can achieve that, but I do not believe that we should reduce the amount of levy that we charge unless it can be demonstrated through technological reasons that the same standard of monitoring could be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the amendment moved by the Opposition, as the Opposition says, there is a potential loss of export income. Prices are down on uranium at the moment. It has been indicated that the price of uranium will not increase until the mid-1990s. I tend to hold that view. I believe that by the mid-1990s prices of uranium will increase. We should be there to take up that potential. We do not have a potential loss of export income at present because the price of uranium is suppressed, so there is no urgency to rush in and change any policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the damaging effect on our international reputation as a fair and responsible trading nation, no country is fairer than us in trading. If the Europeans were ever to have the audacity to say to us that we should consider fair trade, they certainly would win a competition with Charlie Chaplin. I do not believe that either of those two points is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate within our Party about whether we have a three-mine policy is in the public arena. Our Party has been criticised for debating this matter publicly. In some quarters we are seen to be agonising over this issue. Not only is this healthy but also it demonstrates the greatness of our Party. When it has come to tough issues, this Party has always been prepared to debate publicly the aspirations, the views and the hopes of the Australian people. Because we represent such a broad range of people, unlike the very sectional and narrow viewed interests of the Opposition, it is right that those of us with varying viewpoints publicly put our views emotionally and passionately. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not necessarily agree with some people that have opposed extending the policy or who wish to phase down the industry, I defend their right, as members of the Australian Labor Party and as members of the Federal Parliament, to articulate their case in the public forum and to help shape debate. That is what democracy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> We are moving towards our 100-year celebration at Barcaldine this year. The great thing about our Party and the reason it has stood us in such good stead, the reason it still exists-it is the only Party that has existed in its entirety without having to change its name; it is the only Party that can govern in every State without the support of a coalition partner-is that we have bravely taken on these tough issues. Certainly at times during our history we have paid for that at the ballot box and through loss of support. But ultimately this has strengthened our Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I see no problem and no difficulty with my colleagues disagreeing with my position or articulating various points of view as we come up to our June conference. Unlike the Opposition, which pulls policies out of its hip pocket every week as it looks at the opinion polls, and unlike the National Party, which has a meeting in a phone box because that is all the room that it now needs, we do it through the proper processes. We will be debating this issue up until and during the conference. When we come to a position we will put it. In the meantime it does not do much credit to the Opposition to say things to suit its political goals. As I said, the proof is in the fact that we are the only Party that has maintained continuity for 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I believe that we should expand the three-mines uranium policy. First, Nabarlek is phasing down. Basically, we have two mines. If we are to be involved in the nuclear industry it does not make sense to sell a little uranium. If there is a market after the 1990s, it makes sense that we take up that market. To use an old saying: one cannot be a little bit pregnant. We either export uranium for which there is a market or we do not export uranium at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Not many people are saying that we should phase down the uranium industry. Certainly anyone who does should have the courage to tell the people working in that industry in the Northern Territory that they will be out of a job because of this proposition. I certainly do not hold to this proposition. As I have said, I believe that by the mid-1990s, as demand increases, we should be able, and be flexible enough, to take up that opportunity to expand our potential in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects the real price of uranium-oxide to rise as much as 40 per cent in five years. Of course, the International Atomic Energy Agency says that there are approximately 424 reactors producing 17 per cent of the world's power. Seventy-five per cent of France's power is produced in this way and 83 reactors are being built. In our region, Japan intends to build 40 in 20 years. Of course, many more countries such as Korea will be expanding into this area. </PARA>
<PARA> By being involved in this industry we also have a bigger influence and a say in what happens in the world and in this industry. Nothing, apart from a loss of revenue, would be achieved in abolishing the mining of uranium and washing our hands like Pontius Pilate, pretending that we are doing something great for the world. We are not isolated. Environmental problems are world environmental problems; they are not unique to one country. Effects are felt throughout the world; they are not immediate to the neighbouring areas. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a difficult matter in this issue. There are only three sources of power generation in the world today: nuclear power, fossil fuel power and hydro-electric power. The majority of the advocates who oppose the uranium industry or the expansion of the uranium industry also oppose hydro-electric power because they oppose the building of dams. The same people oppose fossil fuels-coal fired power stations. There is the argument that solar energy can replace those energy sources-that is nonsense-and that we should be spending money to look for another source. But the United States of America is spending billions a year and has not perfected any alternative. This means that we have to make a choice between using fossil fuels, hydro-electric and nuclear power. Basically, all three energy sources are used in various countries. Consequently, there is a massive overseas market for coal. I am very pleased to say that between 14 and 23 April is National Coal Week. I pay tribute to the coal miners of this country and the contribution they make to our society, particularly in my region, which has the largest coal fired power station in Queensland. They are the salt of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, we have to grapple with the emotional issues about what sort of power generation we have. As the standard of Third World countries increases, there will be a greater demand for energy-not only energy for lighting and heating but also energy for finished products. I have always been of the view that we can extend and improve our standard and the world's by expanding our smelting industry here. Of course, it would make sense to use our natural gas and coal to do so and export the finished product. I do not hold with the view that we should phase down industry or coal fired power stations. We should actually be expanding them and controlling the pollution here in a sensible way instead of allowing some Third World countries to pollute by not having the proper safeguards. In doing so, we are actually benefiting the whole world, not just our own. We are enhancing the whole world's environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore it is important that we look at the real issues as we, on this side of the House, try to shape the debate between now and June when the National Conference will take place. The real issue is uranium and whether we export simply a small amount or whether we meet the market as it increases. It makes sense to export the uranium for which there is a market instead of trying to be, as I said previously, just a little bit pregnant. That does not make sense. The export dollars that are earned can certainly be used for facilities in areas such as home and community care, housing, education, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, I am very pleased to speak on this Bill. It is a positive way in which this Government is ensuring that environmental standards are maintained; that the company exporting uranium is paying for those standards; and that the monitoring process is put under way. It indicates that we can, with a lot of commonsense and goodwill, overcome a lot of emotional rhetoric regarding the development of our resources and ensure that we have a good standard of living. At the same time, we can ensure that we safeguard the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with many emotional debates is that we cannot have change without change. We cannot develop our society without some change. Those people who are opposed to all change would have us live in the dark ages and live in a tree. I read an example of that in the Australian of 11 April. Some people in Tasmania now wish to drain Lake Pedder. It would cost $31m and it would mean the removal of three dams. If it were not so serious it would be funny, but it is actually being supported. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that demonstrates the ludicrous level of debate on these issues. It makes it harder to maintain the middle ground, a sensible line, between the views of rednecks on the one hand who would cut down every tree, mine every sand dune and not want pollution control and those people on the other hand who are irresponsible, have never done a day's work in their lives and who would deny working men and women a decent job. The latter would sabotage Tasmania economically by pulling down three dams. Of course, if this were done, that power source would have to be replaced. The only alternatives would be coal-fired or oil-fired power stations. Of course, in the view of the environmentalists, they could not be supported because they oppose the use of fossil fuels. We need to think with our heads and not with our hearts when we make decisions on issues such as these. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier in my speech, it is sensible, positive and mature for our Party to debate this issue up till June in the way in which we will do. While I do not necessarily agree with those who oppose the expansion of the three-mine policy, I defend their right to do so, because that is the way in which our great Party has formulated policies on tough issues in the past. That is the way it will do so in the future. I wish to pay credit to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who has carriage of this Bill. As I have said, it is positive, it is a way in which we can help to preserve our environment and, at the same time, earn much needed export dollars for this country and provide jobs for people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not a member of the great party about which the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) spoke, but it seems to me that in the 10 minutes or so of his speech in the debate on the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill he made a lot of sense. There are many things that he said with which I would agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, this Bill rates as the ultimate in hypocrisy by a failed Federal Labor Government. The Bill proposes to increase duty on export uranium concentrate mined at Ranger in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. The proposed increased duty is an effort to implement the Government's policy to move towards full cost recovery of environmental protection measures associated with mining in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) was established by the Fraser Government in 1978 to oversee for the community the mining of uranium so that the environment of the region would be protected from any negative effects of uranium mining. It was never intended in the original instance that there be only one operating uranium mine in the Northern Territory or that the Office of the Supervising Scientist be confined to such a single operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy in this Bill relates to the Government's three-mine policy, which is, in effect, a two-mine policy for uranium mining and export and which has acted to interrupt the normal supply and demand processes of the marketplace and to restrict dramatically Australia's production of a mineral valued by the international community, which production could well be of benefit to the Australian economy in paying its way. The three-mine policy is economically, bureaucratically, ideologically and practically illogical and indefensible. The editorial in the Age newspaper of 18 March 1991 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the most telling argument for expanding the uranium industry was made in last year's Industry Commission report on mining and minerals processing. It blamed the three-mine policy for the fact that Australia, with the world's largest assured uranium resources, had won only 10 per cent of the world market. The report said efforts to force up prices by limiting uranium supplies had not worked and that Canada had captured a greater world market share than Australia at Australia's expense. Removal of constraints imposed by the three-mine policy will offer Australia opportunities to increase export earnings that otherwise will be legitimately taken by competitors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Office of the Supervising Scientist has many duties in environmental monitoring in the Alligator Rivers region. The benefit of OSS reports accrues to many organisations and to Australian society in general. However, the three-mine policy and the Government's determination to gain full cost recovery means that Ranger is forced increasingly, and now almost entirely, to bear the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>However, it-</PARA>
<PARA>the policy of full cost recovery-</PARA>
<PARA>recognises that limitations exist in the present export duty system which, for example, require an amendment to legislation whenever a change to the amount of revenue required is needed. Further, it notes that the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts report on the potential of the Kakadu National Park region and the Taylor review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist suggested that the levy could be applied more equitably as organisations other than uranium mining companies either utilise or benefit from the results of OSS research. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say that the Government will address these issues and examine alternative means of collecting such costs in a more efficient and equitable manner. However, the Minister does not tell us when the Government will address the issues, how the Government will address the issues or in what manner costs will be more equitably distributed. The Minister's mob has had eight years, and still cannot get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission report of September 1990 had a great deal to say about government intervention in the mineral trade. Amongst other things, the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Government intervention in mineral trade has the potential to influence significantly the competitiveness and efficient development of mining and mineral processing activities. Such interventions include export controls, export duties, statutory marketing agreements, export assistance schemes and membership of international commodity agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission was of the view that the Government should refrain from intervening in mineral markets, except in situations where such intervention can clearly be shown to result in a net benefit to the nation. Nowhere did the Commission find that the Government's three-mine uranium policy was equitable or other than interventionist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also found that the uranium industry in Australia is subject to several Government interventions that do not apply to other mining and mineral processing activities. The Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The most important of these is the Commonwealth Government's `three-mines' policy. Although clear public statements of the rationale for continuing this policy are hard to find, debate tends to revolve around two arguments: environmental/safety concerns; and the likelihood/ unlikelihood of worthwhile market opportunities based on speculation about the long-term balance between the supply of and demand for uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Government attempts to manipulate the uranium market by artificially limiting Australian supplies-in the hope of forcing the price up-have not been successful (if indeed that was the intent). </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . also considers there are no persuasive reasons why other uranium mines could not operate under the strict environmental controls and safeguards which currently apply to existing Australian operations and exports. In the Commission's view, Government intervention in this industry should be limited to ensuring adequate safeguards are in place with respect to the mining, processing (including enrichment), transport and use of uranium. In particular, the development of uranium mines in Australia should be a matter for commercial decision. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that in the Industry Commission's view, the Australian Labor Party's three-mine uranium policy is nonsense. I am certain that the Commission knows, as this side of the House knows, as the Australian public knows and as the right hand side of Labor Party politics knows, that the Government's policy is based on just one more sell-out, one more compromise to the ideology of the Left. It is opposed to mining in any form and violently opposed to uranium mining specifically and generally opposed to the economic development of Australia. It was not a very good trade-off and it is not working very well because the Government has distorted all market signals and attempted to place ideological barriers in the way of mining, milling, production of yellowcake and enrichment of the uranium element placed in nature in the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The former member for La Trobe, Mr Peter Milton, was violently opposed to uranium and its use in any form. In speech after speech in this place he described the evils of the element uranium and the dangers to society of its exploitation and use. Never once, to the best of my knowledge, did he ever speak to any of the positive benefits to society of the use of uranium in health or in the production of electricity as a non-polluting energy source. He, like many of his colleagues, was, and probably is, so ideologically blinkered against the mining and export of uranium that he would have us tell the rest of the world that they are wrong and that we should wear economic sackcloth to prove that the rest of the world is wrong and he is right. </PARA>
<PARA> Greenpeace, in correspondence to me in February this year, made the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no safe level of radiation. </PARA>
<PARA>What a damning indictment that is. We live with radiation every day of our lives wherever on the planet Earth man or animal inhabits. Additionally, the medical profession uses radioactive isotopes for investigative and health-giving benefits every day of every month of every year. There are times when one is convinced that the environmental movement wishes to chastise God for ever having created element No. 92, uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Greenpeace in its letter seeks my support for the cessation of Australia's uranium mining and exports. Greenpeace will no doubt be disappointed to learn that not only does it not have my support but, in fact, I would support unilaterally the dissolution of the Labor Party's three-mine policy and replacement of that policy with additional uranium mines as determined by industry but subject to environmental controls. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not in any way support government regulation of the number of mines, the quantity of production, the quantity of export or restrictions on enrichment other than those imposed by the marketplace, by safety considerations, by practical environmental controls, or by the owners or lessors of the land to be mined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taylor review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in November 1989 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no detectable damage to the environment from current uranium mining outside the mine sites-a situation which is a reason for satisfaction but not complacency. </PARA>
<PARA>The mining industry has consistently and without equivocation maintained that it can and is willing to maintain its community responsibility to protect the environment in which it operates. Mining is, of course, an intrusive operation. Great damage is done to the small area in which a mine operates and great economic benefit to the community results. In 1988-89 the mining industry contributed 42 per cent of gross national product. There is no doubt in my mind that the contribution would have been even greater were it not for the grave uncertainties placed on resource security by this equivocating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill indecision by this Government in the run-up to the last Federal election has placed tremendous strain on the credibility of the Government and has had an incalculable detrimental effect on confidence in the mining industry. The industry has no confidence that if it explores, finds, determines to produce and provides satisfactory environmental impact statements its projects can then proceed. The investment community has no faith whatsoever in the Hawke Labor Government that if all the requirements are satisfied a project will be allowed to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent industry statement makes some reconciliation moves towards the timber industry in terms of resource security but offers no such encouragement to mining. Before this Government, with the exception of a brief period of control by the Whitlam Government, the mining industry has largely felt confident in Australian governments that proven projects would proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s there were across Australia seven major mining and mineral processing projects on the drawing boards of national and international companies. By early 1973 industry had lost all confidence in the Whitlam Government and all seven projects were either put on hold or shelved indefinitely. The capital investment required in each of those projects was several hundreds of millions of dollars and the export potential was immense. I make the point that it was not the market that caused Australia to lose those development projects and export potential but lack of confidence by industry in a bankrupt Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now in the 1990s we have another Labor Government which constantly calls on industry to lift its game and invest equity capital in new productive ventures. But industry has no confidence in this Government. The Coronation Hill decision, together with the illogical three-mines uranium policy, are major factors in that lack of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever we talk about developing our natural resources, and specifically when we discuss uranium, the Green lobby and the anti-uranium lobby argue that Australia should not develop uranium reserves because the use of uranium in the world is declining. They lobby that nuclear power plants will no longer be built, that the production of energy from nuclear reactors is inefficient and that, even if it were not, the process is so inherently dangerous that there should be no nuclear fuel cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in its status report in 1990 said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's very large uranium reserves could be an important factor in any resurgence in the use of nuclear power. Australia and ANSTO can also offer an improved method for the disposal of nuclear waste. Generation of electricity represents over 30 per cent of the world's primary energy demand and this proportion continues to increase. Primary energy consumption has risen fourfold since 1950 and is forecast to grow due to the world's continuing large population increase. Recent authoritative studies show that nuclear power is still economically competitive in many countries. It is likely to prove even more so with the development of newer reactor designs in the late 1990s when coal and oil prices are expected to rise significantly in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Taylor review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, tabled in November 1989, made 47 discrete recommendations. I call on the Minister to respond to the report. This Bill being debated today is another piece of legislation to increase costs to industry. Perhaps the Minister's time would be better spent drafting legislation to incorporate some of the cost savings and practical measures recommended in the Taylor report. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1988 the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts brought down a major report on the potential of the Kakadu National Park region. It is a serious report and in great detail. It is instructive to note that the dissenting report is 109 pages while the main body of the report is 233 pages. The dissent is most significant and represents the real major differences that exist between the non-interventionist policies of the Opposition and the economically devastating and practical difficulties that occur whenever the Australian Labor Party examines or legislates with respect to industry or commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> But overriding all, the important consideration that we address here today is that marketplace decisions are best left to industry, not governments. Surely by now the Australian Labor Party should have learned from the disasters of government intervention in Western Australia and in Victoria that picking winners and intervening in business decisions is high risk, unstable business. Investment decisions logically should be left to those who are going to pay the bills, not those who are charged with the primary responsibility of writing laws. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) knows, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) knows, that the three-mines uranium policy is wrong and the Coronation Hill decision was wrong, but both are more concerned with pragmatic politics than with doing what is right for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to begin, since this is a broadcast afternoon of the House of Representatives, by saying on this important Bill that it is interesting that there has been only one speaker from the Australia Labor Party. There is at present not one single member of the Parliamentary Labor Party present in the chamber with the exception of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is required to be at the table. On an issue which is at the moment an issue of great public contention, what is revealed by these simple points is that the Labor Party chooses to debate these issues not in the institution which was created for that very purpose but in the media, in newspapers, on television and within the forums of the Labor Party. But the one place created as the national institution for debate-the Federal Parliament-is the one place where the Labor Party will not discuss this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have to say I think that very much sums up the attitude of the Labor Party to institutions in general. It bears institutions because it has to, but it does not like them. It is the anti-institution party. It wants to get rid of the Senate, in any case. It has no time for the House of Representatives save when it has to put up with it-put up with it imposing on its rule. I wanted to make those points at the beginning, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think you would agree they are relevant to the Bill because uranium is such an important and contentious issue, and yet it is really only we on this side of the House who are going to discuss it--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beddall interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister were concentrating on the debate instead of writing to his friends at home, he would notice that there is a proposal for the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill to be amended, and that is part of the debate. If he does not recognise that that is part of the debate, once more he illustrates my point that he does not understand the institution and is not even trying to understand the institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill increases the levy on the company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) in order to fund the Office of the Supervising Scientist. As the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out, it is levy which is in fact discriminatory, adding something like 5 per cent to ERA's production costs to fund the Office of the Supervising Scientist. But much of the research undertaken by the Office of the Supervising Scientist is, as ERA has pointed out, irrelevant to the operation of its particular mine. That is not to say it is in a total sense irrelevant but it is a quite legitimate point that it makes. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is relevant to the uranium industry in general or if it is relevant to environmental concerns in general, then it should be funded on a broader basis. If it is relevant only to ERA, then there is of course a clearer case for the levy to be applied just to it. But the fact is that on many occasions when ERA has wanted research done which is specifically relevant to the Ranger mine it has contracted the work out to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) because the Office of the Supervising Scientist is not capable of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that the Office of the Supervising Scientist-which was subject to what is known as the Taylor review some 15 or 16 months ago; it reached its conclusions and published them-has not changed significantly as a result of the Taylor review and, more than that, the Government has not even officially responded to the Taylor review. Perhaps when the Minister summarises this debate it will be interesting to hear when the Government proposes to respond to the Taylor review, and what changes it anticipates making in relation to the administration of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee-of which I was a member-and also the Taylor review have pointed out it is inappropriate for the Office of the Supervising Scientist to have staff at Bondi in Sydney when the work they are doing relates to the area near Kakadu. The Taylor review has recommended those staff be moved to Darwin. The Waste Watch Committee of the Opposition recommended they be moved to Darwin. There were indications given that those staff were going to move to Darwin. They never did. Perhaps the view from the tall building in Bondi is prettier than the view they expect to get in Darwin. But we hope the Government, in responding to this debate, will take up those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> But the big issue of this debate and the issue the Labor Party has run away from by having only one speaker in this debate is the issue of the amendment moved by the Leader of the National Party. That amendment points to the weakness and indeed the destructive effect that the Labor Party's three-mines policy is having on Australia's economy, and the irrational nature or, to use the Prime Minister's words, `the illogical nature of the three-mines policy'. In a general sense, I think Australians are becoming increasingly aware that this country has had one of its three worst balance of payments and foreign debt crises of its history since 1788. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge for Australia today is to resolve its balance of payments problems and to trade its way out of its foreign debt. In order to trade our way out of our foreign debt, we have to do a range of things to make the country more competitive. We have got to assist services exports and ensure they become an important part of our export drive. We have got to make our export effort more efficient, but we have also got to continue to encourage those industries in Australia which have been the backbone of our export effort in the past-agriculture, of course, and mining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is wrong for us in Australia to turn our backs on the mining industry-as the Labor Party would dearly like to do. We have to encourage that industry and ensure it continues for years and generations to come to contribute to our balance of payments. Yet the attitude of the Labor Party to the uranium industry and to uranium mining is quite destructive of the efforts that we should be making as a country to resolve our balance of payments and foreign debts crises. The three-mines policy is illogical, as I mentioned earlier, according to the Prime Minister himself. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make four specific points about the effect of that three-mines policy. In the first place, we estimate that that policy, since it was introduced by the Labor Party, has lost Australia export income of somewhere between $700m and $750m a year. Indeed, if we take the full period the Hawke Government has been in office then it is probably fair to estimate that Australia has lost something in the vicinity of $5 billion worth of export income simply because of the three-mines policy. By the middle of the 1990s, we could earn $1 billion a year or more from our uranium exports if the three-mine restrictions are lifted. If they are not, we will be stuck at around $400m or so a year which we are currently earning from that industry, in stark contrast to the $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion a year Canada earns from this same industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has approximately 30 per cent of the world's low cost recoverable uranium reserves. We have about 50 per cent of the Western world's low cost recoverable uranium reserves. Remember, we have 30 per cent of the reserves but we have 10 per cent of the market. We should contrast that with Canada, which has 10 per cent of the reserves and 30 per cent of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> That is actually an indictment of our effort as a nation to succeed in an important competitive export market. Our failing in that particular instance is part of the bigger picture of our failing to resolve our balance of payments and foreign debt problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people on the other side of the House argue that there is not really much demand for uranium any more or, in any case, demand is not likely to increase very much over the next 10 years, so what are, in fact, effectively two mines, because the Nabarlek mine is now exhausted, are quite sufficient-quite sufficient for us to have 10 per cent of the market with 30 per cent of the reserves, and for Canada to have 30 per cent of the market with 10 per cent of the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first point I want to make about this issue of demand. It is not just a question of whether or not demand is going to increase over the next decade-although that is a question which is worth addressing, and I will address it; it is also a question of market share. We might be operating in a completely static market and, over a period of time, it is possible for businesses which are successful and dynamic to make a great deal of money out of a static market by gaining additional market share. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa-I have mentioned Canada already-is a country which also has very substantial uranium reserves. It has approximately 16.8 per cent of the world's uranium reserves. With the ending of apartheid in South Africa and the return of South Africa to the mainstream of the international community, it seems almost certain that it too will be able to build up a greater market share over the next few years than it currently has. And the Government, at least at this stage, is still proposing-and we do not know what the final resolution of the Australian Labor Party's contortions over the three-mines policy will be, although the Government still has as its official policy the three-mines policy-that we should lose market share to Canada and South Africa. So the argument about market share is one that is never taken up by the Left of the Labor Party and their fellow travellers when talking about future demand in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of that argument on demand is really whether or not demand will increase. The first point I would make about that is that the European Community has made it clear that demand in the Community for uranium is likely to remain fairly static. That does not mean that demand is going to plunge down. It means exactly what the Europeans say: it is going to remain fairly static. It is therefore not going to increase very much, if at all. But we do not look only at Europe when we sell uranium; we look at the whole world. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimates of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) tell us a story that we often hear from the uranium mining industry, that is, that overall global demand is likely to increase over the next 10 or 15 years. The IAEA's estimate is that the amount of nuclear electricity generated will rise by about 2.76 per cent per annum between 1989 and the year 2005-from 1,854 terawatt hours to 2,867 terawatt hours. That does not sound very exciting, but the simple point it is making is that demand is likely to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The big area of increased demand is not Europe; for that matter, there may not be a very substantial increase in demand in the United States. The big areas of growing demand are in our own Asia-Pacific area. To use the illustration of Japan, it is estimated that the number of nuclear power reactors in Japan will increase by 2 1/2 times by the year 2010; and there are many countries in south-east and north-east Asia which will increasingly turn to nuclear power generation because of environmental reasons. Anybody who knows those countries-and I hope all honourable members of this House know them fairly well, because they are all very much part of Australia's destiny-will be aware of the fact that they do have significant environmental problems and, therefore, we can understand why they are looking at nuclear power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I want to raise is this point of the danger of having nuclear power stations at all. There are some people who say that, because nuclear power stations are potentially dangerous, Australia should not sell uranium. We might well ask what effect that will have. If we do not sell uranium, is that going to mean that all those power stations close down? Of course it is not. They will still buy uranium; they will just buy it from somewhere else. We cannot make the nuclear industry go away. It is a fact of life and we have to live with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a country which is essentially responsible, which is committed to a very stringent nuclear safeguards regime, which is involved in the international community in the whole process of disarmament and preventing nuclear proliferation, and which is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty itself, we can ensure that, where uranium is sold, it is sold on the right terms and under the right conditions in order to meet safety requirements. If uranium is bought from countries like South Africa or Niger, then those safeguards do not apply and the risks therefore are substantially higher. The simple proposition is this: if it is not sold from Australia then, by definition, it is much more likely to be sold by those countries with the lesser safeguard conditions. Our safeguards also, I would add, require that uranium is not used for any military purpose. Bearing that in mind, that is an additional and very important feature of the conditions under which we sell uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point I want to make is the one which relates to the environment. The environment movement is, in particular, very strident in its opposition to uranium mining and exporting. Indeed, it has to be said that one of the reasons many people in the Labor Party are hesitant about changing the illogical three-mines policy is simply that they do not want to alienate the environment movement. But with those sorts of people, we can never win. They say that nuclear power is too dangerous; they say that coal-fired power stations are too dirty; they say that hydro-electric power destroys the natural environment; and that we are left then only with wind or solar power. </PARA>
<PARA> `Solar, not nuclear': that is the slogan they stick on the back of their cars. When we drive behind those familiar vehicles, we know we are driving behind an Australian Democrats voter or a member of the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, something which, I am sure, Mr Speaker, you would not particularly welcome. Those people take the view that somehow solar energy or wind power is an alternative to all of the other options that we currently use. The fact is that it is not. It would be vastly expensive if we tried to move to that kind of power, which would mean that lower income people would be denied the use of power which they currently take for granted-indeed, we all take for granted-and, as is sometimes said in many developing countries, the lights would simply be turned out. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that nuclear power plants, whilst of course by no means perfect-and they are not perfectly safe; nothing mankind has every created is, I suppose-do reduce CO2 greenhouse gases. In fact, their existence worldwide has reduced CO2 greenhouse gases by 20 per cent compared to having that same amount of power generated by coal fired power stations. In the United States the nuclear power stations have cut CO2 emissions by 9 per cent; they have cut sulphur dioxide emissions by five million tonnes per annum; and they have cut nitrogen oxide emissions by two million tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the three-mines policy is little short of an intellectual nonsense. It is something that makes no clear sense. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who has come into the chamber, presumably to hear my speech on the uranium industry-I would have hoped so; I would be disappointed if he had not-is the man who described the three-mines policy as illogical. Did you not, Prime Minister?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I say, I seek your indulgence to correct an answer I gave to the House earlier today and, in doing so, to apologise to the House for my incorrect recollection as to the sequence of events in 1987 involving a decision not to impose a tax on gold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be clear from my explanation that, on the recorded facts, the central imputation that Mr Connell received from me a private commitment in this matter in return for which he undertook to make a financial contribution to the Australian Labor Party is unfounded. On the information available to me when I provided the answer to the House earlier today, my recollection was that the Government had made no firm decision and had therefore made no announcement on this matter before the luncheon in question. I was absolutely certain that I would never have made a commitment as to what Government policy would be on any matter in return for the promise of financial support from any person and I was certain I had made no such commitment to Mr Connell. </PARA>
<PARA> As it turns out, the record confirms that belief by revealing that in fact the decision and public announcement that there would be no tax on gold had been made before the luncheon meeting on 15 June 1987 at which Mr Connell was present. In fact, in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in Perth on that very morning of 15 June-that is, well before the lunch-I was asked whether the Government would, on re-election, impose a gold tax. In response to that question, I gave a categorical no. This response was consistent with assurances I gave on 7 May 1987 at the annual dinner of the Australian Mining Industry Council, when I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that after a review of the taxation arrangements for the gold mining industry, we decided not to remove its current income tax exemption . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat it. My recollection as to the timing of the decision and its announcement was wrong, and for that, I repeat, I express my deep regret to the House. But for me, most importantly, no-one can question the critically important standard I have asserted for myself and for my Government that our policies cannot be secured by the provision of financial support. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very serious set of allegations has emerged in the course of the hearings of the Western Australian corruption inquiry, the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia, and I believe the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should be given the opportunity for a much more complete and substantive statement of the events of that period than in fact has been given in adding to his answer earlier today. There are a lot of major inconsistencies between what Mr Connell has said under oath in this corruption hearing and what the Prime Minister has so far been prepared to put on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is very important to the integrity of the Prime Minister and his Government that he clarifies-and I notice that he is leaving the House at this point-the situation in respect of that lunch. There are plenty of unanswered questions about the nature of the lunch, the organisation of the lunch and what expectations were raised in the minds of the businessmen who attended that lunch. We have seen some evidence on record that they had been approached prior to that lunch in order to indicate that it would be a fundraising occasion and it is important to know precisely what matters were discussed at that lunch-simple facts like whether the gold tax itself was discussed, whether what the Prime Minister said in the context of that lunch was the basis on which Mr Connell apparently drew the conclusion that the Government was prepared to give a solid commitment and whether that then formed the basis of his decision to donate to the Australian Labor Party campaign funds the $250,000 that has been identified. </PARA>
<PARA> But, while there is that particular detail about the lunch and a lot of other questions, a host of other issues have been raised in relation to the Prime Minister's links with Mr Connell and WA Inc., as it has become known, and many of these, I believe, should be answered as a matter of urgency by the Prime Minister in this House. The Prime Minister has a responsibility to this Parliament in the first instance to give a clear and complete account of his particular role in relation to that, and there are a lot of other issues which stem from that which relate to the fact that declarations as to campaign contributions were made, but apparently there is no reference to the $250,000 donation by Mr Connell, which it seems, from the evidence which has emerged so far, was given in the context of an election campaign. Therefore it is hard to believe that it was not a campaign contribution subject to declaration under the Government's own laws. </PARA>
<PARA> But the importance of this matter goes beyond the particular details. An enormous stench has emerged out of the activities in Western Australia, a stench that has carried right through to the very highest position in this Government, to the Prime Minister himself. I would think that somebody who was concerned, as the Prime Minister claims to be, about the standing of Parliament, the credibility of politicians and our need to lift our game and to be more publicly accountable to the people of Australia, off his own bat would feel an enormous sense of personal urgency about coming in here and clarifying a lot of those details. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as those concerns about the detail exist, that stench continues. As every day goes by, it seems we get more and more evidence of the nature of the links between this Government and the Government in Western Australia under then Premier Burke. Until that is clarified, then this whole Parliament, and the standing of us all to some extent, gets consistently called into question.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the related role, of course, of ex-Premier Burke himself. The Prime Minister seems quite happy, on the basis of mateship, to allow him to continue in his position as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. That is an amazing situation given the magnitude of the damage that can be done to our international reputation by the fact that ex-Premier Burke, now Ambassador Burke, is allowed to continue in that position. It has been the subject of focus in the Irish newspapers; it has obviously been a cause for considerable concern among our diplomatic corps; and it has obviously been a major concern in the public arena, where most newspaper editorials have now called on the Government actually to have ex-Premier Burke stand down until his name is cleared. Yet again the Prime Minister is not prepared to do what the people of Australia expect him to do, and that is to set the basic standards by which we ought to operate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister is called into question and his Government is thereby called into question, ultimately it will seep through to affect all of us. I believe he owes it to people of Australia as a matter of urgency to come into this Parliament and show the sort of leadership that he ought to show. </PARA>
<PARA> But unfortunately we see continuing evidence that this Prime Minister has no capacity for leadership. He won the last election campaign unexpectedly and has provided absolutely no leadership at any stage since then. He has lived from one crisis to the next, without any sense of direction, without any policy conviction, without any capacity to deal with the increasing pain and hardship of the average Australian. We saw the latest dose of information in that respect today, with a 9.2 per cent unemployment rate; that is an overall barometer of the degree of misery that he and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have inflicted on the people of Australia as a result of the Prime Minister's incapacity to provide leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> But perhaps one of the most amazing things which has emerged in recent days, which I believe leads us to the reason why the Prime Minister is not prepared to come in here and account for his actions during that period, was the amazing statement he made that no-one buys favours from his Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In eight years the record of this Government is absolutely impeccable. </PARA>
<PARA>There would not be anybody in Australia who would be prepared to agree with that view. The Prime Minister would be the only person who would be capable of concluding that no-one buys favours from his Government. His government is an entire litany of deals. Every single thing that has been done by the Hawke-Keating Government over the past eight years has been based on a deal. It thinks that way, it operates that way and it does not ever act in the best interests of the people of Australia: it acts only in the interests of particular individuals or groups. We can just go back over the past few months and look at the extent of the deals which have come to light. There are the unannounced payments to certain ethnic groups in the course of the last election campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was the decision to change the television ownership rules and restrict foreign ownership. For whose benefit were those changes made? There was the decision to not take the first best option in relation to telecommunications. He settled for the third best option. The gentleman at the table is principally responsible for conning the Prime Minister into taking the third best option, once again never acting in the best interests of the people of Australia in any of those cases but in the best interests of some group, some particular sectional interest; never acting in the national interest, but acting in the interests of the Government's mates, basically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So one can go on. Look at the Telecom decision for a start. Who was the Government looking after? It was looking after the supporters in the Telecom union, which all the evidence suggests has an excess of labour built into Telecom of about 30,000 of the 90,000 who are in there and which has built one of the most inefficient telecommunications systems in the world. The first best solution to deal with that is to open it up for full-blooded competition.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go on in terms of the extent to which this Government has been run by special interest groups and deals. It has blocked major development decisions like Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill. It has failed to develop any significant progress towards privatisation, reform of the labour market, tax reform or the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax. Each one of those things was stopped by a particular vested interest deal or by the power base of the union movement. I go back to my basic point: this is a question of leadership, not mateship. The Prime Minister is dominated by mateship. His answers here today were totally unsatisfactory as far as providing the detail of what has transpired is concerned. Until the Prime Minister is prepared to come in here and give a full and complete account of his activities through that period, the stench will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He would have been laying down before the House in plenty of time for the main commercial television news tonight the detail of his withdrawal.

<PARA> This is a very serious matter. The Prime Minister has over the years come up with this special relationship that Ministers have argued Bob Hawke has with the people of Australia-this special relationship, this special degree of credibility. I say to the House that this is the Prime Minister's last chance because that relationship has already been jeopardised and will be jeopardised further by the backwards looking approach that he has applied to this critical saga by his inadequate response. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the coalition are giving him the chance to come forward to make a comprehensive statement to tell all that he knows which led to this famous published letter on 7 July, just a couple of weeks after the famous luncheon in Perth, when the Prime Minister felt the need to spell out in enormous detail one key aspect of the gold industry policy. Which aspect did he happen to settle on for that letter of 7 July? Let me remind the House:</PARA>
<PARA> You have my undertaking we will not introduce a gold tax during the next three year term of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter was signed by Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and dated 7 July 1987, a couple of weeks after the luncheon. That is not the issue; the real issue relates to the Prime Minister of this country and his inadequate response, and to the whole concept, as correctly detailed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), of mateship in the Labor Party. I will never forget the words in that disgraceful speech by the failed Treasurer of this country just two days ago regarding the late Sir John Kerr. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA> When people cross the Labor Party they wear the crosses it puts on them. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, quite the opposite is also true: `If you do not cross the Labor Party, if you continue to toe the line and if you stay in the club, the Labor Party will look after you.' That is what the Prime Minister is doing with regard to his mates; that is what the Prime Minister is doing in relation to Brian Burke. It is an absolute disgrace, in respect of both the Vatican and our representation to Ireland, that that man has not been stood down, stood aside and brought back to Australia at behest to respond to all that is being said and to the `serious allegations', to quote the Prime Minister, which had been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that Senator Richardson has added, `A friend will back you when you are right, but a mate will back you when he knows you are wrong'. We have had the Prime Minister weaving around with regard to Brian Burke for 72 hours, which he is now going to regret. I appeal to the Prime Minister to respond to his duties as Prime Minister of this country, return to the House and give a totally adequate explanation with regard to the whole sorry saga involving the undertakings given and all the other matters arising in relation to this disgraceful `goldgate' affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will have their opportunity to deal with that when the time comes for the matters to be raised in this place. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) decided that he ought to have an opportunity in this place to raise a particular statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the gold mining industry on the subject of whether or not the Labor Party at the 1987 election would introduce a gold tax. There were great guffaws from the other side of the House at that very short letter of the Prime Minister saying that he would not-and, indeed, did not-in the life of that Parliament introduce a gold tax. Of course, what the Leader of the National Party neglected to mention was the letter that was standing alongside it. The letter that was standing alongside it was signed by one John Howard. What did it say? It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Your Council has asked for a statement of the Liberal Party's policy on the taxing of the gold mining industry. I am happy to oblige. </PARA>
<PARA> We are totally opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. As my colleague Senator Peter Durack, Shadow Minister for Trade and Resources, stated in June last year, a Liberal Government would repeal any gold tax introduced by the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we are. The position of the Opposition on that particular occasion was that it would not support the introduction of a gold tax. What the Prime Minister corrected in the House in his addition to the answer was simply the point of time at which we decided, in the course of that runup to the election campaign, that we would undertake not to introduce a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The central feature of this accusation is that somehow or other Laurie Connell got a private undertaking-the undertaking-from the Government that there would be no gold tax introduced. In fact, what was pointed out by the Prime Minister was that a public commitment as far as that was concerned had been given by the Prime Minister on several occasions previously-once immediately prior to that particular luncheon in a public broadcast in answer to a question asked by an interviewer in Western Australia, and once effectively a month before, when he made a speech to the Australian Mining Industry Council saying that the Government's position was that it was not going to introduce a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> So the notion that is the substance of the accusations that have come forward from the Opposition that somehow or other a private undertaking or an initial undertaking or whatever on this matter had been given to Laurie Connell in the course of that luncheon is, of course, a complete nonsense. It was publicly stated well in advance of that particular occasion. Of course, it was a position that was duplicated by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to remember why these sorts of things were in the ether at the time. They were in the ether at the time for one simple reason: this Government had undertaken a serious reformation of the taxation system in this country, over the total opposition of the Opposition, whether it be on capital gains tax or entertainment tax-all the changes we had put in place to remove the ramps and rorts in the taxation system. So what was naturally assumed by people in the gold industry at the time was that, if this Government was prepared to take the tough stand on taxation issues, inevitably it was going to get around to the issue of the gold tax. So the industry wanted those commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of an election campaign in which we had on our side of the House a substantial number of our members opposed to the introduction of a gold tax, when we had the Western Australian Government and Opposition opposed to the introduction of a gold tax, when we had the Opposition opposed to the introduction of a gold tax, the situation for us was that we were not going to jettison totally our capability to be elected by going through with one final phase of the introduction of decency into the taxation system in this country, and we said we would not. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very short space of time after the election we moved to correct that, confirming the undertakings we had given the industry prior to the election that we would not introduce a tax in the life of that Parliament, but effectively bringing into being the taxation in the Parliament afterwards. So we were caught in a political situation that was a product of the Opposition's dishonesty, its preparedness to support ramps and rorts in the taxation system-confirmed at vast length by its Leader, that he would continue his record of supporting ramps and rorts in the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a contemptible motion for which we have nothing to answer and on which the Prime Minister has nothing to answer. It should be defeated and it will be. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question be now put. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill amends the present Act to increase the duty charged on uranium concentrate exported from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory from $1.15 per kilogram to $1.30 per kilogram. I remind the House that when I first spoke on the original Bill in February 1987 the duty was only 11c a kilogram, so it has gone up very rapidly. This tax is used to finance the operations of what is quaintly called the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS)-a government quango-which is responsible for monitoring, controlling and conducting research into the environmental effects of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1989-90, the OSS spent $7.31m. In the financial year 1990-91, this tax is estimated to raise $7.212m, so the two amounts are approximately line ball. The OSS was originally set up as a sop in many ways to the anti-nukes to get the Nabarlek and Ranger uranium mines operating in the Kakadu National Park area. It was envisaged at the time that several mines would contribute to the cost. Unfortunately only the Ranger mine is operating and must pay all the costs. If other mines were operating the rate would probably be 20c a kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the deferment of the Coronation Hill project, which has a little uranium in it, Denison's operation at Koongarra and, of course, the rich Jabiluka deposit of about 200,000 tonnes which, at $40 a kilogram on the forward contracts, would be worth about $8 billion. Nevertheless, Ranger is operating and in 1987-88 sent away 4,193 tonnes overseas with an export value of $409.7m. The following year, 1988-89, it exported 4,506 tonnes worth $404.8m, and in 1989-90, it is estimated that it will export 4,088 tonnes worth $275.5m out of which it will make a profit of about $50m. On top of that, we have one other uranium mine operating in this country, at Olympic Dam, which produces about 1,200 tonnes and I believe that is to be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ranger uranium mine is already controlled by 17 pieces of Commonwealth legislation as well as 36 pieces of Northern Territory legislation and is tied up with 22 relevant agreements. It seems that every grain of sand, every leaf, every lizard foot, if you like, is regulated and governed in some fashion. Over and above this, we have the duplication of the Office of the Supervising Scientist with its 75 staff and 51 houses in Jabiru. A third of those staff are based on the twenty-fourth floor of the Triple M tower at Bondi Junction in Sydney. In its annual report it mentions the following interesting things: 21 per cent of the staff come from non- English speaking backgrounds; three of the staff have disabilities; all of the staff regularly attend equal employment opportunity seminars and network meetings, and there has been no sexual harassment for the year. I am sure that we are all pleased to hear that. Over the last 12 months or so there have been conferences at Brisbane, Canberra, Frankfurt, Sydney, Jabiru, Ballarat, Darwin, Melbourne, Alice Springs, Adelaide and, interestingly enough, Barcelona. </PARA>
<PARA> As a qualified scientist, I can say that a fair bit of the research seems overly academic with often dubious relevance to Ranger's operations. I will read a couple of examples. In 1990 four gentlemen presented a paper titled The determination of aluminium in dithionite soil extracts using a catechol violet spectrophotometric method. Another paper titled Bedload transport in sand-bedded stream in tropical northern Australia was presented by a Mr Roberts at the Fourth International Conference on Fluvial Sedimentology at Barcelona in October 1989. Another paper titled Thermoluminescence dating of Late Quaternary deposits in northern Australia was presented by the same gentleman and another at the Second International Conference on Geomorphology and Geoecology at Frankfurt in September, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt this is all very interesting. It has been going on now for more than 10 years. With a country that is $131m in net debt, quite frankly I doubt if we can afford it. The Office has never found anything significantly wrong with Ranger's operations. I put the question: who would actually notice if the Office of the Supervising Scientist disappeared overnight and a group such as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation took over its functions?</PARA>
<PARA> An even greater nonsense-I refer to the amendment moved to this legislation by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-relates to the three-mines policy, now the two-mines policy. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has been agonising about this. Some members want to make a correct decision; others want to hang on to the old decision. I suggest that members of the Labor Party should make up their minds as to whether they are for or against and get away from the half pregnant position that they are in at the moment where some uranium mines are supposedly good and other uranium mines, for some reason, are supposedly bad. I think it is a laughable and scarcely credible policy for a major party to hold in this country today. It is almost beyond belief that the Labor Party tried to defend it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the arguments the Labor Party uses, for example, is that if more mines were opened up it would collapse the price of uranium around the world. This conveniently overlooks the fact that we supply only about 10 per cent of the world's uranium and, therefore, the effect that we have with our production is relatively small. Also, other countries are starting up new mines and the more we restrict our own production, the more likely they are to start up further mines overseas to our detriment. As our supply is restricted, this helps countries such as South Africa and Canada, and I do not think that that is in Australia's interests. It should be a commercial decision taken in Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that the honourable member for Wide Bay agrees. Rather than the Government trying to pick winners, the companies make the decision. No company will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in such operations unless it is judged to be viable. Companies are in the best position to do so. Before they open a mine, no doubt they would seek out and win and have signed, firm contracts for uranium at profitable prices for the years ahead. I am alarmed to think that the left wing of the ALP is so dumb that it cannot understand this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill decision is a classic one. There is not an enormous amount of uranium at Coronation Hill, but there is $500m of uranium and other metals-mainly platinum metal-sitting there for the taking not that far from the surface. If companies started looking further they would, no doubt, find more. Platinum type metals are used to cut down pollution in fuel used in motor cars. That would be of benefit to the environment. I would have thought that the left wing of the Labor Party would have leapt at that rather than importing our platinum from overseas, most of which probably comes from South Africa if the truth be known. This site has been mined before as well with no adverse effects. </PARA>
<PARA> Uranium of course is used in nuclear reactors to produce heat. All the uranium we sell is strictly controlled in this regard. The heat produced then has water pass over it, the water turns to steam, the steam drives turbines, the turbines are connected to generators, and the generators produce electricity, which is in dire need all around the world. In fact, 17 per cent of the world's electricity is now originally produced from uranium as opposed to coal and oil. If we had to replace that 17 per cent of electricity produced by uranium we would either have to burn another 620 million tonnes of coal or use 2,700 million barrels of oil. I am told that that in itself would pump about 2,000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, something that none of us would want. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally I support uranium with proper safeguards because it is cleaner, cheaper and safe. One only has to look at a 1,000 megawatt plant, which produces about enough electricity to supply a city of one million people, to see that this is true. I wanted to incorporate in Hansard a couple of relevant tables. I had shown them to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table. He was originally of the disposition not to allow me to incorporate them. I do not know whether he has reflected on this and changed his mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say to the honourable member for Parkes that it is a matter for determination by the Chair as well. The Chair would need to see the tables to see whether they fit in with Hansard guidelines. I am more than happy to look at them. At the end of the honourable member's speech I can give an indication. If the tables were brought forward I would be able to do that for the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your consideration, and I thank the Minister for his decision. The nuclear waste that comes from such a plant that would supply a city of one million is very slight indeed, as can be seen from one of those tables. If it were a coal plant it would belch 7.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year and 40,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, which of course causes acid rain. Nitrogen oxides and various dusts would be belched out, as well as a considerable amount of radiation, which people overlook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An oil plant would produce more than half as much carbon dioxide, twice as much acid rain and various other things. But a nuclear power plant would not pour out any of those things into the atmosphere, though there would be a slight amount of radiation, which could be safely stored in a container as can be now done. Australia has led the world in the synroc development. Thousands of forests and lakes overseas have been either killed or poisoned by acid rain. The more that we can get away from this the better. If we switched all the coal to uranium tomorrow, which of course we would not do, we could reduce the greenhouse effect alone by eight per cent to 10 per cent. That single action would have a more beneficial effect on the greenhouse problem than any other action. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas countries not under the influence of this country's Labor Left recognise this. Already 29 countries, as indicated in one of those tables, have 424 nuclear power plants now in operation. There are 112 in the United States, with one under construction; 56 in France, with another six under construction; and 41 in Japan, with another 10 under construction. Around the world overall another 83 are under construction. Already France produces 75 per cent of its electricity from uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the Left in this country wants to turn off the lights, shut down the factories and let the people freeze. The alternatives put up by the Left are pathetic. Solar energy was mentioned earlier in the debate. I am in favour of solar energy, but we have to recognise its limitations. To supply Sydney with solar energy we would have to cover 300 square kilometres with solar reflectors, and they would be effective only when the sun was shining. Think of all the aluminium we would have to mine; all the steel, the copper, the silicon, et cetera, that would go into that. Other alternatives such as fusion, which I also support, will not come into fruition well until the next century. The risks involved with it have to be kept in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> Two and a half thousand to 3,000 people die on the roads every year in Australia. There is a greater risk when climbing the ladder to check the solar panels on the roof than there is with having nuclear power plants properly run. Just to give a few instances, in 1979 a dam in Morvi in India collapsed causing 15,000 deaths. In 1963 another dam collapsed in Vaiont in Italy causing 3,000 deaths. In 1978 a liquefied petroleum gas road tanker exploded in Spain killing 200 people. In 1989 a train ignited some gas lying in a valley in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at the time I was there and killed several hundred people. Every year there are coal mine disasters all around the world. We all remember the tragic accident in Appin in New South Wales where over 40 people were killed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course every year many people die from lung diseases because of coal mining. Up until 1986 uranium had 4,000 reactor years without one death or accident. That included the Three Mile Island incident in 1979 where, I remind honourable members, nobody was hurt, let alone killed. Even in 1986, when we had that horrific and very regrettable Chernobyl incident, the explosion was due to steam from overheating in a very badly constructed plant-something that would not be allowed in the Western world today. The way the plant was operating was totally irresponsible. It released fissionable material into the atmosphere. Two people died immediately from it. Unfortunately, another 29 fire fighting staff who went in there also died. As I understand it, 31 has been the total extent of the deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> A report hit my desk just a couple of days ago. Despite the hoo-ha, only another 70 people out of the 75 million people who surround that area will probably die as a result of further cancer. That is dreadful and very regrettable and everything must be done to stop it, but let us put things in perspective. Just recently the Bhopal chemical disaster in India killed 2,500 people and injured 150,000, and nobody is going around talking about shutting down chemical plants; we are only asking that they be safely run. </PARA>
<PARA> Background radiation is with us; we live with it. It is in the soil, in the rocks-particularly granite-in buildings and even in human beings. An average 70 kilogram human being has 100 grams of weakly radioactive potassium. I myself am punching out 2,000 gamma rays per second into my body. Any one of those could cause a mutation in a cell, which could cause me to get cancer. As well as that, I am punching out another 1,000 from my body and this is probably hitting the people around me. We live with this all the time. It has been calculated that the average American gets 30 times more radiation from a television set than from all the 112 nuclear power plants put together. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 the world resources of uranium stood at 2.32 million tonnes in non-communist countries. Of that Australia had 32 per cent, South Africa 16.8 per cent, Niger 13.8 per cent and Canada 10.7 per cent. Even though we had twice as much as the next largest country, South Africa, we supplied only 10 per cent of the world market. Canada, with 10.7 per cent of the supply, supplied 30 per cent of the market. The left wing of the ALP is denying this country hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings, which are flowing on to other countries such as South Africa and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that the annual reactor related demand for uranium in the non-communist countries will rise from 41,900 tonnes of uranium this year to 52,900 tonnes in 15 years time, in the year 2005. Whereas in the same time the supply will fall from 33,000 tonnes to 26,000. There is a widening gap. Cumulatively that will mean a 252,000 tonne shortfall on the 750,000 tonnes of uranium that will be needed in the next 15 years. I know that there is about 100,000 tonnes in Western country stockpiles and there is a similar amount or more in what were communist country stockpiles. Nevertheless, there will be a cumulative shortfall of about 34 per cent without touching stockpiles. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should be getting in on the act, writing the contracts and getting these mines off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Coal's share of electricity generation will rise, possibly from 51 per cent now up to 60 per cent in the year 2010 and up to 80 per cent in the year 2030 if other mines are not opened. That will mean more carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that the amendments to this Bill should be strongly supported. Some rationality should be injected into the debate. We should concentrate on lessening the greenhouse effect in this country and cutting down on acid rain, which fortunately we do not have, although overseas countries do. We should begin to get some real jobs and real prosperity for this great country of ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this debate on the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill, I want to address three issues. Firstly, I want to address the question of the uranium levy, its extent and who pays for it. Secondly, I want to address the role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) for the Alligator Rivers region and the monitoring and research required for uranium mining, particularly in a World Heritage area. Lastly, I want to address the direction of future uranium mining policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the principles set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). Those principles are as follows: firstly, Kakadu National Park as a World Heritage area needs special protection; secondly, the Government's commitment to the monitoring and research role of the OSS, particularly in view of the Industry Commission's recommendation; and, thirdly, the policy of full cost recovery of all government expenditure required to protect the environment and carry out necessary research in relation to uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support the implication in the Minister's statement that the Government accepts the thrust of the Taylor review of the OSS for a reassessment of the levy with the object of spreading the burden more equitably among all beneficiaries of OSS research. It should be recognised that the method of adjusting the levy, as well as determining the appropriate level, is unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory in that, as the Minister stated, any change requires legislation. It is also unsatisfactory in relation to what is really a very arbitrary charge. While it is one thing to accept the principle of full cost recovery, it has also to be recognised that scientific monitoring and research costs can be virtually unlimited. Some control should be exercised in the form, perhaps, of a legislated fixed percentage cost based on the current levy and, to some extent, related to production, with future increases in line with the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> As the OSS has been in existence for a decade and a great deal of research has been done and problems canvassed, it is time that a fixed level of monitoring and research charge was established. As to the question of who pays the levy, there is certainly an overwhelming case for distributing the tax to all who benefit from the results of research, but in addition it should apply equally to all companies involved in uranium mining in Australia. This latter suggestion is bound up with a need to substantially reform the function of the OSS and its relationship to Northern Territory authorities and other Commonwealth authorities. As the Industry Commission review indicates, the administrative arrangements for the environmental protection of Kakadu National Park in respect of uranium mining contains the seeds of their potential failure. The evidence is that these administrative arrangements have failed. The Industry Commission has competently analysed the miasma of bureaucratic overlap, jealousies and the shortcomings of the administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the conclusion of the Industry Commission is that the OSS should be abolished and responsibility spread among the various Northern Territory regulatory bodies and a range of Federal institutions. This would obviously please the mining companies, based on their repeated objections to the OSS, but administratively it would leave most of the overlapping bureaucratic problems intact. The fragmentation of function and responsibility to this degree would leave serious doubts about the effectiveness of any real monitoring or research under such an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of the OSS taken by Professor Taylor is to be preferred to that of the Industry Commission. Doing away with the OSS and distributing its functions among a grab bag of Northern Territory and Commonwealth authorities, as advocated by the Industry Commission, would ensure that the environmental monitoring of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region becomes a low priority and a poorly focused activity. With so many different bodies involved, there would be confusion about roles and an increased risk of a gap in the defences maintained by the OSS against serious pollution. Further, there is a distinct lack of public confidence in the effectiveness of monitoring by the various Northern Territory instrumentalities, given the resources available to them and the gung ho attitude of the Northern Territory Government to mining generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Uranium is the only mineral whose ownership is reserved by the Commonwealth Government. All other minerals are owned by the respective Territory or State governments. A more effective and efficient way of carrying out the supervision, monitoring and research role would be to place all these functions under a single Commonwealth authority responsible for all aspects of mining throughout Australia. This would avoid all the bureaucratic complications of the present Commonwealth-State split arrangements. This would involve not abolishing the OSS but extending its functions and changing its name. Such a course would be justified, particularly given the ownership and special nature of uranium mining in respect of both short term and long term effects on the environment and health. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of where the current debate on the future of uranium mining leads, an effective and efficient mechanism for monitoring and research is required for both the immediate and long term future-if there is a long term future. While opponents and proponents of nuclear energy are equally vehement, the future is not predictable. The present problems of nuclear energy, namely, safety, cost, transport and waste disposal, may or may not be solvable in an unknown time frame. </PARA>
<PARA> There are severe problems in nuclear energy, such as the difficulties in ensuring the safety of radioactive materials and in ensuring that they are not diverted to weapons use; the large question mark over reactor safety-especially since the Three Mile Island accident in the United States of America (USA) and the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine; problems in the safe transport of plutonium and other extremely dangerous materials; the unresolved issue of the safe disposal of nuclear waste for periods of time-up to thousands of years-not previously encountered in human experience; and the failure of nuclear energy to demonstrate that it is an economic solution to energy needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of nuclear energy were rather poignantly underlined by the arrival in Australia last week of a contingent of Chernobyl children who had been invited here for relief from debilitating radiation exposure at home. A report in the New York Times in March 1990 suggested that the Chernobyl accident may cost the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics about $US300 billion by the year 2000, according to a Soviet nuclear industry economist. Such a loss would exceed by several times the net economic contribution of the Soviet nuclear industry since its first reactor was commissioned in 1954. </PARA>
<PARA> The French Government's manufacturer of reactors, Framatome, has not succeeded as an exporter of nuclear plant and has had no new business from the French power authority Eletricite de France since 1987. The Swedish Government recently decided to stay with its earlier commitment to phase out nuclear power by the year 2010 but has retreated from its pledge to begin shutting down reactors in 1995. Instead the Swedish Government will spend 3.8 billion kroner, or about $A1 billion, over five years to develop alternative sources of power and to improve energy efficiency. One billion kroner is to be spent on energy conservation, a further billion kroner on energy by biomass such as wood and other organic materials, and the remainder of the money on other forms of renewable energy, including wind power. The closure of nuclear plants is to proceed when alternative sources of power are proven. </PARA>
<PARA> Korea is planning 55 new reactors over the next 40 years. It is this market that provides the basis for optimism among Australian uranium mining interests. Japan is reviewing its nuclear program after a number of incidents. Two of its reactors are not producing as a result of incidents. The Japanese Government wants 40 new reactors built in the next 20 years, but a scarcity of sites and enormous public opposition make such a program problematical. No new reactors have been ordered in the USA since the Three Mile Island nuclear power station accident in 1978. Canada reduced its uranium production by 23 per cent last year and is expected to cut production again this year. The Rossing uranium mine in Namibia, one of the world's largest mines, is expected to reduce production this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people who support uranium mining point to its immediate economic benefits to Australia, the fact that a number of other countries, notably Canada, will satisfy market demand if Australia does not, and the need for us to be involved in the nuclear power industry in order to exert a moderating influence or to help to deal with the safety problems and to help ensure that nuclear materials are not diverted to weapons manufacture. Value added to uranium in Australia and aggressive marketing could add $3,500m per annum to Australian exports in the year 2000, according to some proponents of uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two sites at which uranium mining is currently carried out and three at which mining is proposed. Mining is current at Olympic Dam by Western Mining-BP and at Ranger by Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. Mining is being proposed at Jabiluka, East Alligator River, by Pancontinental, at Koongarra, South Alligator River, by Denison Australia, a subsidiary of Denison Mines Canada, and at Kintyre by CRA. The Kintyre proposal may have difficulties due to Aboriginal objections and all three proposed new mine sites would affect national parks. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other well defined deposits also exist. At December 1989 Australia had a `reasonably assured' resource of uranium amounting to 474,000 tonnes in the low cost recovery range of less than $US80 per kilogram. Australia has 29 per cent of the world's resources in that category. Ranger produces about 3,000 tonnes per annum. It was to increase production in the late 1980s but has put its plans on hold. Ranger could double output to 6,000 tonnes per annum. Olympic Dam produces 1,450 tonnes per annum but could expand to 4,000 tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial increases in uranium production, between two and three times current output, can be achieved without any new mine needing to be opened. It can therefore be argued that if it is desirable to increase production it would be more cost effective for Australia to allow the existing two mines to expand. It would save a lot in capital outlays, reduce the need for overseas borrowings, and confine the environmental effects. The existing producers are competing on a world market. There is no need for a new operator to be approved just to ensure competition. </PARA>
<PARA> After a rising trend in the volume of uranium exports from 1987-88 to 1990-91, peaking at 7,520 tonnes, a significant reduction is projected for 1991-92 of 4,500 tonnes. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in 1990-91 the value of exports was $368m. In 1991-92 exports are projected to be $300m, confirming a decline. In 1987 Australia's world market share was 10 per cent and Canada's 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Energy Resources Australia Ltd, its Ranger uranium mine in the 10 years 1981 to 1990 returned a before tax profit of $926m and $477m after tax. The mine contributed $295m to income tax, paid $16m in special export levies, $96m in royalties to Aboriginal groups and $27m in royalties to the Northern Territory Government. Dividends of $344m were paid to shareholders over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise figures for persons directly employed in uranium mining are not easy to determine. This may have something to do with the fact that Olympic Dam employees also mine copper. It appears that a figure of 1,000 employed Australia-wide is about the level. Ranger quotes 300 for its mine and a figure of 400 has been given for Olympic Dam, a total of 700. If employment is the objective, uranium mining is not the answer as it is a poor employer on the basis of capital invested. Manufacturing generates about 17 times as many jobs per $1m value added, and mining in general five times as many jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This may be seen as an argument for uranium enrichment in Australia, which would add value and employ more people. The Industry Commission seems to accept that if Australia increases its market share and goes in for uranium enrichment, an extra $3,500m per annum could be generated in export earnings by the year 2000. Opinions about world demand for uranium over the next decade vary widely. The Industry Commission in its draft report on mining and minerals processing in Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the short term demand will be affected by the current large inventories around the world and the extent to which power utilities run them down before re-entering the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates of potential demand for uranium submitted to this inquiry differed considerably . . . </PARA>
<PARA>While mining companies predict a boom, an authoritative and objective body, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, has offered the opinion:</PARA>
<PARA>Until the year 2000 the installed global capacity of enrichment supply will exceed the likely demand. Diversity and security of supply will encourage customers to support new suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission tended to prefer the view of NUKEM, a West German nuclear consultant-an unfortunate acronym, reminiscent of Dr Strangelove-which sees a significant uncommitted market for Australian uranium in north-east Asia. The wild card in the pack is the Soviet Union, which could easily dump uranium in markets such as South Korea that Australian mining interests are looking to for new business. </PARA>
<PARA> The uranium industry has seized on the greenhouse problem as the answer to nuclear energy's failing fortunes after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Coal burning power stations give off carbon dioxide and contribute to atmospheric warming. Nuclear fuels do not contribute to the greenhouse to the same extent. Many reject nuclear energy as an answer to greenhouse because it is not safe, efficient or economic. The Toronto protocol, calling for a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with 1988, cannot be met with new nuclear power plants, with their high capital costs and 10-year construction times. </PARA>
<PARA> Improved energy efficiency and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, small scale hydro and biomass are considered to offer much better prospects than nuclear power, on both environmental and economic grounds. This is borne out by the direction Sweden has chosen. The huge capital costs of nuclear power stations continue to make them uncompetitive. In the shorter term, improvements in energy efficiency, natural gas, and even low sulphur coals and oil are more likely to be seen as better answers to the greenhouse problem than nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the most advanced research into new energy technology is being carried out in Australia. In a submission in 1989 to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology Dr David Mills said:</PARA>
<PARA>If an Australian-owned consortium were to heavily push Professor Martin Green's Photovoltaic (solar cell) technology at the university of NSW, a large export industry could arise by the mid 1990s, when the market internationally may reach $20 billion a year, which should grow to hundreds of billions thereafter. Smaller commercial efforts like Windmaster and Siddons Solar Systems . . . would grow rapidly with utility support, which could lead to extensive exports. Solarhart already exports widely, but would be encouraged strongly if utilities would lease such products. </PARA>
<PARA>As Dr Mills noted in his submission to the Senate Committee, a national approach is needed to take up these opportunities. It is for the national government to take the lead within the context of a national sustainable energy plan. Compared with the debate Dr Mills and other well informed people are involved in on the development of solar and other renewable energy sources to cope with the greenhouse problem, the current debate on opening another uranium mine seems short-sighted and out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the present situation is that the evidence points to a poor market for Australian uranium in the 1990s. There is no certainty that nuclear energy's problems of safety, cost, transport and waste disposal will move any closer to a solution, given the failure to solve them over the last two decades. There is every likelihood that, given the lack of expansion of the nuclear industry in those countries with strict controls, nuclear expansion will take place in countries with inadequate controls, leading to accidents and yet another major setback for the industry. Over the next decade the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, given its understandable lack of enthusiasm for nuclear power following Chernobyl and its distressed economic position, may oversupply the world market for both ore and enriched uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> With this future it seems unwise for Australia to proceed with massive foreign borrowings necessary to expand uranium mining into either new mines or uranium enrichment plants. Given the reserves available in both Ranger and Olympic Dam, which are more than adequate for the 1990s, there is a very weak case in the public interest to approve further mines. The private interest is another matter, and it is no doubt the driving force behind the current moves to change government policy. Again, with the present reserves of uranium in existing mines, there is little case for initiating new mines in any national park, let alone a world heritage area such as Kakadu. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that the present three-mine policy is illogical and tinged with hypocrisy. It could hardly be otherwise as it is only a compromise between the `leave it in the ground' approach and the `grab the money and run and hang the consequences' approach-the two extremes ferociously advocated by different sides. The ultimate logic of the latter view is to move immediately to uranium enrichment and make Australia the world's nuclear waste disposal dump. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of a lack of logic in the uranium policy in the past, that view must be rejected on economic, environmental and safety grounds, and most of all because it is not acceptable to most Australians. It is significant that in countries where people have been given the opportunity at referendums to decide on nuclear power-Italy, Austria, Switzerland and some States of the United States-they have all rejected it. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments that Australia can play a part in curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the reduction of environmental risks by being an active participant in the international uranium industry have no validity. Nothing Australia does will have any real impact on either the safety of nuclear energy or the extent of weapons proliferation any more than our participation in the world armaments trade will decrease the risk of war. The simple fact is that there is no imperative to change Australia's uranium policy at the present time. It would be misguided to fall victim to a nuclear cargo cult mentality as a refuge from the current economic difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose the amendment moved by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It clearly is some sort of political stunt by him. I am quite amazed, as the Minister for Customs, that this is one of the largest debates I have ever seen on a customs tariff amendment Bill. In fact, this could almost be called the kryptonite debate. Many of the honourable members opposite have been overly affected by being too close to the particular metal or mineral that is referred to here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party, sought confirmation that the uranium levy in late 1989-90 resulted in collections of $4m, whereas this year collections are expected to raise $7.2m. The discrepancy, as the honourable member noted, resulted from the levels of uranium exported in each year. The remaining stockpile from the Nabarlek mine was exported in the second financial year, 1990-91, and the accounts for the extra revenue are expected this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the levy and the companies from which it is to be collected, the Government is addressing the recommendations of the Taylor review-the review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) commissioned by the Government. The Government objectives will be to implement those recommendations which are aimed at enhancing the performance of the OSS, thus improving the environmental management in the Alligator Rivers region. I cannot anticipate the response to these recommendations, but the Government is committed to improving the operation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and will act accordingly on receipt of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also anxious to ensure the environmental costs are equitably shared. The present arrangement of levying the tax on the one existing uranium exporter in the region has some short-comings. These are acknowledged by the Government. These will be addressed in the Government's consideration of the Taylor review. I am conscious that recommendations on this issue were also made by the Industry Commission in its draft report on minerals and in the draft report of the Resources Assessment Commission. The Government, however, has quite properly focused on the need to ensure that those engaged in uranium mining should bear the cost of monitoring the environment to ensure that there are no adverse environmental impacts arising from those mining activities. Thus it would not resile from the rationale for a levy which is that the cost associated with protecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers region from potential adverse effects of uranium mining exploration should be borne as far as practicable by the companies carrying out the mining activities and exploration, and not the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made a contribution and, as is his wont, he made the point that he thought there were insufficient Government members in the chamber for such an important debate. I do note the honourable member for Mayo has not found it important to be here for the closing of this debate. But I will address some of the criticisms that he levelled at the legislation. He said that the Office of the Supervising Scientist is not relevant to mining companies. It should be noted that it is not the role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist to conduct research relevant to solving mining engineering problems of the companies. It would not be appropriate for taxpayers' money to be used in a way that directly benefits those companies; rather, research of the Supervising Scientist, summarised in chapter 2 of the 1989-90 annual report, tabled in December 1990, is undertaken to acquire knowledge of the environment to enable the formulation of control measures that will ensure the degree of confidence sought by the community that a high level of environmental protection can be obtained in the Kakadu National Park. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In resuming this debate on the industry statement, I would like to start by just saying that this was heralded as a statement that was supposed to address the long term, underlying problems of this country. By any measure, I think everyone has realised, it has failed miserably. Just after the 1987 election and during that campaign, no-one less than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us that micro-economic reform would be the number one priority of his third term in Government. That sentiment was echoed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who said that micro-economic reform was critical in getting the big picture right and he was totally committed to getting that big picture right. But, of course, nothing happened. Nearly four years later, a term later, the Government is still spouting about what it is going to do; four years, and we are still waiting to see it. The Prime Minister was whingeing in the Australian, the day after this industry statement was made, about the cry for faster reform. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>So I want to nail it. We put micro-reform on the political agenda of this country, and we have stayed ahead of the game ever since. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that the Prime Minister must have some very bruised fingers if he wants to keep nailing it because, in four years of trying to nail it, he has not done a hell of a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just quote one of many responses to the industry statement. Let us look at the response to a survey conducted by Arthur Andersen and Co., one of the biggest accounting firms in this country, which, immediately after the release of the statement, polled industry:</PARA>
<PARA>The survey results confirm the view that the Government has failed to grasp the initiative in relation to micro-economic reform. Industry in general has, moreover, been sorely disappointed with the failure-</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `failure'-</PARA>
<PARA>to introduce further incentives to stimulate capital investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a damning indictment if ever there was one, but one that has been put forward by many commentators in many areas. At a time when we are in the most serious recession in Australia since World War II, we have to ask the Prime Minister why he did not take that opportunity to give us some real hope for the future. Why did he not tackle some of the major problems facing this country-problems like our inflexible labour relations; problems like our insufficient transport sector; problems like the Government's mistake of putting the burden of policy adjustment on interest rates because tax and wage policies were tied down with its deals with the Australian Council of Trade Unions? I am referring to the Government's deals and its quick fixes-the sort of thing that we heard about just before the dinner break concerning the Prime Minister's efforts in Western Australia and doing deals with his mates. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Prime Minister not address other problems like the lack of domestic savings and the serious growth in our overseas debt? We now have an overseas debt of over $130 billion, the greatest we have ever seen in this nation's history. Why did he not deal with the overly complex tax system? Why did he not deal with the chronic inflation problem we have had whereby, over the last eight years, our inflation rate has been double that of our trading partners? The fact is that this great industry statement only played at the edges and, worse than that, it is going to throw many of our manufacturers to the wolves. While the coalition parties support the reduction in tariffs, we must have reforms in other areas so that our manufacturers and our exporters can lower their costs at least to world levels because, if they cannot do that, we cannot be competitive with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, one of the most disappointing aspects of this statement is the virtually total lack of reference to land transport reform. Yet it was only 12 months ago that the Prime Minister wrote a letter to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must explore all options to create and fund a competitive land transport system, and must ensure the best possible return from the huge annual investment in this area. We must create a rail system which offers effective competition to road transport, and which is more productive, integrated and reliable than at present. Pursuit of the national rail freight initiative should be a priority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> That was 12 months ago. What have we seen? We have seen committees, more committees, meetings and rhetoric. As always, the Prime Minister loves to talk about what he is going to do, and yet, as I said at the beginning, after four years we are still waiting to see some results. As was quite astutely observed by Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the other place, before the new protection regime starts to be felt by the industry the Government has to demonstrate results in the transport sector and other areas. Yet the statement virtually ignored the problems of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening with the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and his State counterparts. On 5 April, I am told, there was a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC). What happened? We saw a typical example of what the Government cannot achieve. The meeting resolved to do virtually nothing other than to meet yet again and to form yet another committee. We have seen five committees look at transport in five months, from the Special Premiers Conference and from ATAC. It seems that this is a committee-led recovery; when we talk about land transport reform, all we seem to do is have more committees. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at the importance of reform in this area. If we turn back to 1989, a joint study between the Industries Assistance Commission and the Business Council of Australia was released, suggesting that reform in the transport sector could lead to savings of over $3 billion in our transport costs, and this in turn could lead to a lift in our annual production of at least $6 billion or 2.3 per cent increase in our gross domestic product (GDP) in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is more than that. If we got that reform, we would see real wages increase by 3 per cent, we could see a government surplus increasing by $1 billion-a surplus that I would suggest right now the Government would be very keen to hear about-and we could see real consumption rise by at least $720 per household. In short, the benefits from that land transport reform would be at least three times as great as the abolition of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the impact of transport and the main savings of this $3.2 billion, we find that the main savings-40 per cent-would come from efficiency improvements in our railways. Forty per cent would come from rail, and yet to date the Government has achieved nothing in its eight years. We would see 27 per cent from more efficient water transport-coastal shipping, waterfront and ports-19 per cent from cheaper bulk land transport, and 14 per cent from cheaper international shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> In February last year, the Business Council published further work which said that micro-reform in general in the transport, communications and power generation areas collectively could increase the gross domestic product by $16 billion or 5 per cent of GDP over 10 years. But, more importantly, it would be four times as much as the benefits of the reforms that are being claimed from this industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Government really has only skirted around the edges and has failed dismally to tackle some of the major areas of real reform, areas that it was talking about back in 1987 and areas on which to date we have seen no action-nothing more than reports, committees and talk. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the big problems facing this country right now is that not only are we failing to tackle these reforms, but also we have a government that likes to compare itself with the past. It ignores what is happening on world standards, ignores the way other countries have moved their reforms and tries to compare with the past at a time when other countries were not seriously tackling their transport as a problem. They have since done it and have got results; unfortunately, we cannot say the same. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the more specific problems we have to face in the land transport area, we could start with roads. We have problems with the lack of uniform regulations and road rules. We have lack of consistent operating regulations. We have problems with many roads; they are just inadequate. Over the last seven years, as many honourable members would know, the Government has cut road funding by 27 per cent in real terms. This lack of adequate roads can add to the fuel consumption of vehicles by up to 20 per cent and repair costs by up to 40 per cent. I could go on about this, but the fact is that, whatever way we look at it, the lack of action here has been very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the problems with the lack of action on the question of sales tax on trucks and truck parts, we find that, despite recommendations from a number of reports-including the last Inter-State Commission report-that sales tax ought to be reduced from 20 to 10 per cent, we still have seen no action on that. This is why many in the trucking industry are starting to realise that the coalition's proposal of a goods and services tax not only makes a lot of sense but also will help them to become more efficient and will certainly reduce their input costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We could look at the question of rail reform, an area that has been spoken about so often. The Industry Commission, in its 1989-90 report, showed that 30.5 per cent overall cost reductions-over 30 per cent!-are possible from achieving international standard work practices. The major savings would be 35 1/2 per cent in labour costs and 34.1 per cent in materials and savings through increases in productivity. The Industry Commission also estimates a 20 per cent saving on farm to wharf transport costs with the removal of monopoly carriage rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Excess rail freights in Queensland and New South Wales can be up to 50 per cent on the cost of rail freights. Yet in almost eight years in office it seems that Labor has done very little to tackle these and many other problems.</PARA>
<PARA> But when we listen to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Land Transport talking about rail improvement and the benefits that may come from the National Rail Freight Corporation, we have to keep it in perspective, and the perspective is that interstate rail freight accounts only for about 12 per cent of the total rail freight. The question can then be asked: what about the other problems facing rail? For example, this week the Victorian Government-that wonderful government that all Victorians are so ashamed of-had to announce that the rail system had a $1.2 billion deficit. I am sure even you, Mr Deputy Speaker, who knows more about it than most of us, must feel very uncomfortable seeing what was once a great system being so badly run and so badly managed. In fact, the rail losses in Victoria from freight alone were $262m. It is an absolute scandal, but it is a reflection of the standard of government that unfortunately Victorians have to put up with. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the industry statement does nothing to tackle this or many of the other reforms that are so desperately needed in this country to bring us up to world standards practice. Yet when the opportunity has been there, when clearly the coalition parties would support any sensible reforms, it seems that the Government has become totally hidebound and unable to act in the areas that will show real gains-particularly, as I mentioned, in rail. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I would like to come back to some of the solutions that the coalition parties would be prepared to put forward. We have said that we will support sensible moves. We have shown that we would support a national rail freight initiative and even some aspects of the Inter-State Commission report, subject to some fairly strong qualifications. But we will not countenance any further cuts in road funding. Frankly, we do not believe Australians can afford it, and we have said that in fact it should be increased. We also believe there should be moves to make the States more accountable for the money they spend and we believe there should be more competition between the various modes of transport, and that will come about not by increasing the charges of one section of the transport industry, but by addressing the inefficiencies, particularly in rail and on the waterfront, the inefficiencies that have been put forward so many times. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that other areas of reform have to be addressed if business is to have its best chance of success. We strongly support the introduction of a goods and services tax and the scrapping of the ramshackle wholesale sales tax system that is so confusing that nobody understands it. We believe there has to be labour market reform and there has to be better balance on all arms of policy, not just on interest rates. Clearly if we are to compete in the twenty-first century we have to start to make these adjustments now. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's statement, despite all the hype and rhetoric, has turned out to be a dismal failure, and people throughout Australia have recognised that it has failed to address the major issues before this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about building a competitive Australia is an objective that all in this House can identify with. It is not only an objective but also a direction for the nation that is of relevance to every Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement on 12 March, as well as initiating some new policy directions, brings into sharper focus and increases the emphasis of a number of Government initiatives over the past eight years. It is of major significance as an integral part of the process of developing a cultural and attitudinal framework more fitting to the needs of Australia. For most of this century and certainly during the supposed golden years of the Menzies era and the resources boom of the Fraser years, Australians were encouraged to believe that we could sell our wool, wheat, coal and iron ore, and buy the world's best manufactured goods. Not only were we encouraged to believe this, but also we were given the impression that this would continue for ever. </PARA>
<PARA> The trumpeting of the resources boom by the Fraser Government in the late 1970s is probably the most glaring example of the kind of wrong-headed leadership provided to the people of Australia by those who sit opposite. For decades they led Australia badly, developed attitudes that were the opposite to those needed and eventually, when they generated the collapse of the economy, they blamed the work force instead. The simple fact is that decades of Liberal-National government basically projected our manufacturing industries as places to keep people occupied. It did not matter whether they were economically viable or productive because our sales of resources and primary industry were our core business and if things went bad, we would simply dig up some more coal or iron ore. </PARA>
<PARA> The accuracy of this observation is demonstrated by the fact that during the life of the Fraser Government the percentage of our work force involved in manufacturing declined by one percentage point per year, from about 25 per cent in 1975-76 to about 18 per cent in 1982-83. The challenge facing this Government and the nation is to reverse the attitude developed over decades that our only important industries are primary industries and resources and that we did not really need to compete and perform in all aspects of modern commercial and industrial activity. That the Prime Minister's statement squarely addresses this challenge is demonstrated by the inclusion of such components as advanced manufacturing technologies, the Australian quality awards, international performance benchmarks, the Australian best practice demonstration program and the initiatives for the aerospace industry. The competition that Australian workers had been encouraged to undertake was essentially between States or between themselves and management. This competition was not simply unproductive but totally counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more than slightly hypocritical for those who sit opposite and who governed Australia so badly for so long, and in the process helped to entrench these attitudes, to assert now that they know best how to correct the problems they caused. In projecting its solution, the Opposition demonstrates not only its lack of understanding of the problem but also its eternal adherence to divisiveness and confrontation as its main mechanism of national management. Let us take the example of the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). He boasts about his battles with unions and his attacks on tariffs, which he believes will assist in reducing costs to Australian farmers. He also instigated one of the largest sectoral fundraisings ever undertaken in Australia, namely, the National Farmers Federation fighting fund, in which reputedly $15m was raised from Australian farmers. However, in his activities he focuses his attacks and personal vilification on those Australians who play such an important role in the transport linkages that so influence the export of our farm products. They are linkages that clearly need changes and improvements, but they will not be obtained by grandstanding and vilification. </PARA>
<PARA> The current vulnerability of Australian farmers, particularly our wool producers, is in no small way due to their exposure as marketers into the lowest level of the textile chain. If Australia were exporting yarn rather than raw wool, our wool producers would have a much more stable and predictable market. Not only would the farmers benefit, but also the nation would benefit through the increased value of its wool exports. Given the significance of this, one would have imagined that the National Farmers Federation would have been the major advocate of establishing additional wool processing in Australia. An organisation capable of raising so much money simply for political campaigning would have, one expects, no difficulty in raising sufficient funds to establish wool scouring and spinning facilities in this country. But no, it prefers to spend its time brawling with wharf labourers and bucketing our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition current catchcry of accelerating the rate of micro-economic reform further demonstrates its fundamental dishonesty. The Opposition cites the trans-Tasman freight service, a relatively small part of the export market, as a major problem and attacks the shipping unions for the costs involved. Nowhere does the Opposition demonstrate that it is aware of the changes in the manning levels of ships which have been occurring and the schedule which will mean that virtually all crewing on Australian trans-Tasman shipping will be at Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels in the next few years-a decrease, incidentally, of some 50 per cent and, in some cases, more. The shipping industry is a example of the potential achievement of dramatic reforms through intelligent analysis and consultation. The Opposition talks often about industry, yet I doubt whether any more than a handful of Opposition members ever enter a factory. For their benefit, let me point out that the massive reorganisation and restructuring of Australian industry and the micro-economic reform within the factories of Australia that this Government had to initiate are now largely completed. While economic conditions may be tough at the moment, our companies are positioned to recover as they have never been before. The old stagnant companies that were so devastated by the Howard-Fraser recession of 1982-83 are now lean, modern and flexible. They are better managed and more productive. Mind you, they still look the same from the outside, so unless one goes inside, the reform does not appear to have happened-and that is the dishonesty of the Opposition. Its lack of any real interest and concern for our manufacturing industries has been so perennial that it has not changed one jot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's major catchcry about the deregulation of industrial relations and enterprise bargaining is the greatest deception of all. It is simply a methodology to reduce indiscriminately the wages of Australian workers in an unpredictable and haphazard fashion. Does anybody genuinely believe that individual companies will not simply dismiss employees who do not accept lower wages; that books will not be cooked to demonstrate that the company will close unless wage cuts are implemented; that companies in smaller towns with a captive work force will not use that captivity to reduce the cost of its wages; that we will not see an oversupply of companies operating on the basis of twice as many people for half as much money per person? That is what industrial deregulation and enterprise bargaining mean. The Opposition sees them as reforms. I see them as throwbacks to the Dark Ages of Australian industrialisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the problems that confront Australia, we now have a new element. While thousands of our companies have changed their ways with new management, new practices and new productivity, we now see a new class emerging. It is a class of corporate management-not operative management, not people who manage the companies, who organise and generate the production and sales, but people who manage the shares. This class of so-called entrepreneurs has plundered the fruits of the productive elements of so many Australian companies. Imagine the despair experienced by employers and particularly senior management who went through the pain of restructuring and fighting back after the horrors of 1982-83, only to find owners changing overnight and the company assets and/or profits being ripped off. In many cases these companies have now been closed down or are so highly over-geared and so cash flow starved that they cannot function effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This new class in the Australian commercial scene has done tremendous damage, and it is vital that we all learn to differentiate between the operative company management and the corporate or board management of so many of our companies. The operative management is to be congratulated on its achievements in these last eight years, on its restructuring and its turnaround inside so many organisations. It is tragic to watch the results of that enormous effort being squandered and pilfered by people who have no real interest in manufacturing but simply look at companies as a source of cash or assets. The tragedy of all this was, of course, the interminable time it took to get the States to agree to national corporate legislation-legislation that so many opposite still violently oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement is a further step in the transformation of the Australian economy into a modern, competitive one. It follows the massive changes this Government has introduced into the taxation system, the restructuring of the award system, and the development of strategic policies and programs. It provides the conceptual framework for the next stage of our evolution. Our evolution is significantly complicated by the small size of our economy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in the value of our currency. Obviously, the Australian dollar is subject to massive speculation, as shown by its turnover vastly exceeding the volume of our trade. </PARA>
<PARA> A high dollar assists in containing inflation and moderating the value of our foreign debt, but at the same time it reduces the competitiveness of our exports and makes imports cheaper. A lower dollar would then reduce our imports and make the level of tariffs much less significant. It would also improve the competitive position of our exports. So a realistically valued currency strikes a balance between the benefits and disbenefits. Theoretically, a floating currency should reflect our costs of production, and a correctly valued currency would remove the need for other artificial forms of protection. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis it is clear that our currency is currently overvalued. This results from the market not being totally objective but subject to the very human values of fear, security, confidence and so on. In a sense, Australia is a victim of its own attractiveness. The world sees a safe, stable country that is addressing its economic fundamentals and, hence, is a good place to invest money. The resulting premium that it places on our dollar has become a major impediment to the full benefits of our efforts being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Building a Competitive Australia is a major statement and one that provides a coherent conceptual basis for the continued evolution of the Australian economy. It is vital that all Australians see it in its totality and do not judge only the aspects that affect them directly. However, as I indicated earlier, I am of the view that full benefits will come only in the context of a more realistically valued Australian dollar and effective and stringent policing of corporate Australia by the Australian Securities Commission. Of course, this assumes that the Opposition fails in its attempts to take us back to the bitter and divisive days that it found so politically fruitful and that Australia found so tragically unproductive. I commend the statement to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the deep recession this country is experiencing is, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said, the recession we had to have, this Hawke-Button industry statement is surely the statement we should never have had to have. What it contains ought to have been Australian Government policy all along-what is in the statement, plus much more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) was not at all convincing in his accusations against previous Liberal-National Party governments compared with what has been done under the Hawke-Keating Government over the past eight years. I remind the honourable member that the Government has been there for eight years, and here we are with the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Today's unemployment figures show an actual unemployment level of 825,000, to which can be added many more disappointed job seekers, carrying it to well over one million, with all the tragedy and deprivation that that spells. We have that plus the high and mounting overseas debt as the twofold legacy of the Hawke-Keating Government's economic failure. </PARA>
<PARA> The origin of this statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was the pressure from the left wing of the Labor Party that began to build during December to `do something' about the recession. In fact, the damage to the Australian economy by belting the life out of spending by murderously high interest rates had been done and there was not too much that could be done by way of a short term resuscitation of the economy. We had to take a longer view. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement turns out, under industry and Opposition prompting, to be a reasonably respectable one as far as it goes; but it has been near universally pointed out that it does not go far enough. Given the magnitude of the challenge for change facing this country, it is in fact pathetically inadequate. This Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, really have no understanding of the massive changes in attitude and practice necessary to meet the challenge for this country to become truly, dynamically internationally competitive and, thus, in today's tough international economic climate, to achieve higher living standards and our other objectives of adequate welfare, more for defence and so on, while containing and eventually reducing our vast overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The path we have been on in recent years is just the opposite. It is one of falling living standards, now culminating in the recession, and mounting debt. What this statement and this whole debate is about is that that cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> The centrepiece of this statement is a planned reduction of industry protection, notably tariffs, which are to be reduced to an average of 5 per cent by 1996. In the current context of deep recession, high and rising unemployment and business profoundly pessimistic, one would have to concede some political courage in that, and I do. I point out, however, that it is following the lead of the coalition's announced policy prior to the Budget session last year that all tariffs should be reduced to negligible levels by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the statement is that, while this is to be accompanied by a range of measures such as improved depreciation allowances, the elimination of some sales tax on inputs and other like measures, there is little other than rhetoric and posturing in respect of the areas that really matter, namely, labour market reform, industrial relations change to permit and encourage enterprise bargaining for increased productivity; and, secondly, meaningful, really effective structural change-so-called micro-economic reform. As everyone knows, micro-economic reform is jargon for changes for increased efficiency in transport, the waterfront, telecommunications and so on, to bring them up, hopefully, to international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The position in Australia today is that Australian industry pays between 20 per cent and 50 per cent more than its overseas competitors in these areas; that is, for transport and telecommunications, electricity supply, water, construction costs and so on. The waterfront, for instance, has been exhaustively discussed in recent days. International best practice in places such as Singapore and Rotterdam is that the average number of containers moved by crane drivers per hour is 25. In Australia it is 11. Again, it typically takes five to six days to turn around in this country a ship which Singapore would turn around in five hours. The cost is 100 per cent or more up, not just the 20 to 50 per cent that I referred to a moment ago as typical. </PARA>
<PARA> How on earth can Australian industry be internationally competitive saddled with such excess cost burdens? Yet here we have a statement in which the Government says that it is to implement a significant program of tariff reduction, which is good, but without at the same time any real commitment to speeding up the present snail's pace of structural change, and without a commitment to significant industrial relations change. I want to stress that. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, I say again, supports the bringing down of the tariff but it is-to quote the Opposition shadow Minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)-`unreasonable and unfair' to do that, to bring down the tariffs, without undertaking the reforms, the changes, which will remove the excess costs in transport, telecommunications and so on that make it so hard for Australian companies to be competitive. That is the sort of regime we want-tariffs reducing according to a known schedule and comprehensive structural reform for lower costs in transport, the waterfront, power, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very good illustration in a submission by the motor industry to the Industry Commission which shows, on the one hand, compounding losses over the next few years where there are tariff cuts but little tariff reform and, on the other hand, a lower graph showing a growing, profitable operation as costs are reduced by changes for greater efficiency. I wonder whether that might be reproducible in Hansard. As there is no Minister at the table at the moment, perhaps we can pursue it when I finish my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were to face up to carrying through what needs to be done in these areas I have referred to, carrying through with a sense of urgency and commitment comprehensive micro-economic reform and so forth, and were also to face up to industrial relations reform, the prize for success would be great indeed. The potential gains are really exciting and incomparably superior to anything which might stem from the `tinkering at the margin' which we get in this present statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly stress the industrial relations aspect. Put in place the necessary legal and institutional changes to facilitate enterprise bargaining for increased productivity, free up the workplace, get rid of bad management and employee work practices, organise for maximum productivity and the results can be quite fantastic-as with SPC Ltd, the Shepparton Preserving Co., in its agreement with its employees, so much in the news around last December and the new year. That company and its employees claim an increase in productivity since then of the order of 48 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That might be a somewhat spectacular result. But there are nevertheless authoritative estimates, from the Industry Commission, the Business Council of Australia and others, that with a combination of micro-economic reform and industrial relations change-not only in the services areas such as transport, to which I have referred, but spread through the whole economy, with the private sector also moving towards world standard productivity levels-by the end of the 1990s there could be achieved a quantum of the order of $43 billion to $50 billion of additional national production in Australia. That is of the order of an additional 12 to 13 per cent-something like four years worth of growth added to what would normally be achieved. If it is put another way, $45 billion or so would be the total of current spending on defence, health and social security put together. This could be the prize for a determined program such as I have referred to. It is a great prize. </PARA>
<PARA> We have Government Ministers like the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) fulminating about how hard it will be; for example, how hard reform on the waterfront will be. Sure, it will be hard. In this process we will take on some pretty strong resistance and some tough unions. It is also hard because in all these areas, both in the service-type areas I have referred to and in the private sector workplaces around the country, the challenge to attain world best practice is greater than it appears at first sight, because the best practice itself is improving. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, if an Australian workplace now has a productivity level of between 25 to 30 per cent behind best practice overseas but that best practice itself is improving at 5 per cent per year, then to catch up in a reasonable time span the Australian rate of productivity growth would have to be two or three times faster than that overseas. To catch up in, say, five years time the Australian enterprise would have to double its output for the same employment level or halve the number of its employees. This is not the sort of improvement projected for the waterfront by this Government-a mere 30 per cent improvement over three years! Sure, it will be hard. What is important is that we now know what has to be done. If this Government will not or cannot get on with it, then we will have to get on with changing the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude on this note: some might say-and I am conscious of this in my role as President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship in this place-that my focus on this great prize of $45 billion to $50 billion of extra gross domestic product is an untoward emphasis on gross materialism. Against that I quote the words of Christ:</PARA>
<PARA>Of them to whom much is given, much will be required. </PARA>
<PARA>The thrust of the policy as I have argued it here is the proper and responsible exercise of our stewardship in this richly endowed country. To understand that, I mention only one aspect. As I do so, honourable members should bear in mind that a substantial part of that extra product is investment in new factories and equipment and extra net export production to bring down our current account deficit to a sustainable level. So I put the question: is it right for this country to go on calling on scarce world savings to the extent that we have over the past seven years, building up our massive overseas debt, when a considerable proportion of that debt has financed consumption, housing, consumer finance and, beyond that, office blocks and shopping centres-and not productive capital investment? We have been using up scarce world savings to boost private spending-our high, too high, private living, and also excessive government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> So I answer that it is not right-nor, more hard-headedly, is it economically sustainable in the long run. Already, as the most recent balance of payments data underlines, the net interest income payable overseas matches, exceeds, the balance of payments deficit; that is, in borrowing further at the rate of over $50m a day to finance that debt, we are borrowing to pay the interest! I conclude by saying that, rather than that, we have a bounden duty to lead this country in a better way than we are shown in this profoundly disappointing Hawke-Button statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate, first of all, with a commitment to the basic philosophy and policies outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and endorsed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. If we are to become a clever country, then I think there are a number of things we have to look at if we can without jaundiced eyes. I found the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) disappointing for two reasons. The first is a matter of philosophy. His view is that, somehow or other, all we have to do is totally deregulate trust with implicit faith in the free market and, secondly, attack the trade union movement and all will be well for the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are continuing strains running from that stance which emerge from speakers of the Opposition. They talk about failure to address transport policies and they talk of a failure by the trade union movement to respond to challenges of productivity. Let us look objectively at what has occurred in Australia over the last decade in terms of social and economic groupings. If there is one group that broadly has responded and made sacrifices in terms of its living standards in order to get Australia moving, it can be said that the work force of Australia, whose membership is largely in the trade union movement, has been a party to the accord and has accepted levels of restraints on the basis that that was in the best interests of their families and in the best interest of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I do not think the same can be said about many sections of corporate Australia. We have had a period when not merely the banking sector but the finance sector have had money for all kinds of get rich quick schemes, but were not prepared to put equity capital into the basic infrastructure of our manufacturing industry. I, and I am certain other honourable members, watched the television program dealing with the development following basic research carried out in Australia of the gene shears technology. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) spoke about that this week. He pointed out that as far as he is concerned-and I think properly so-if we have to rely on overseas companies and overseas equity in order to develop this very important discovery, then we will do that. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support that, I felt a sense of shame, as did many Australians, when we saw the capacity and inventiveness of Australians in producing what is a very significant breakthrough in an area of great importance to the world. Not a single Australian company was prepared to back that up. If we look at what has occurred in this country we see that there have been the occasional wild cat strikes. No-one believes that that has not occurred. Can anyone say that the actions of any single trade union or any single combination of unions has done as much damage to Australia overseas and internationally? There has been public concern about the financial structures of Australia as a result of the speculation and trading in stocks and bonds-the takeover exercises which have taken place in Australia with the Bonds, the Skases and the Elliotts. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members opposite whether they are concerned to make the sorts of judgments which are passed about those whose incomes are largely from $400 to $500 a week? Honourable members opposite should ask themselves the following question: who has been prepared to accept reductions in living standards and who has been prepared-not to find $1m or several million dollars for the development of basic infrastructure-to take new technologies discovered in Australia and advance them to provide the kind of equity capital that is needed to build up our manufacturing base? Why would anyone want to do that when one could make a takeover bid for a company, force the price of shares up and let the stocks run wild and free? Even if one did not finish up taking it over, one would walk away with $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> When the average home buyer goes to the bank to borrow for a first mortgage he has to pledge himself for the next 25 years. But time after time banks-not just one State bank whose activities are public, but the banking sector in Australia-endorse the high fliers without any kind of basic security. The banks did not ask for security and when things got tough, to whom did they turn? They turned to the small manufacturer, the small businessman, who never gets the kind of consideration extended to the high fliers playing wild and free with the money of their investors and, in many cases, borrowing beyond their means. That is the reality. We all watched that happen. What sort of judgments did the Opposition make? Yet time and time again, when we consider policy statements such as these, members of the trade union movement are treated as though they are somehow an alien species, as though they are not really part of the fabric of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of his very limited experience, it is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to say, `We can solve our problems if we just look at the example of SPC'. Anyone who lives in a regional centre in Victoria or anywhere else will say that the relationship that exists on a factory floor in a country town anywhere in Australia is significantly different from the relationship that exists between people in factories in major metropolitan areas and industrial centres. Why? Because the foreman or the person working on the lathe can find himself in the same social club or in the same bowling team as the director of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> When there is the threat of a closure of any major employer in a country town, the whole town rallies. They are not merely looking at a loss of jobs; they are looking at the loss of the town itself. That ingredient does not exist to the same degree in our large metropolitan centres. To say that SPC is a model for a new industrial relations scheme is palpable nonsense and stems from the Leader of the Opposition's lack of knowledge on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement lays the framework and the foundation for future actions. But one aspect gives me concern, particularly as a Victorian-and that is the reduction in tariffs for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Because of the unemployment situation in my State and in Australia that policy seriously needs to be reviewed. I take one example: one shirt manufacturer has spent millions of dollars in providing up to date and modern computers. This manufacturer is proud of his work force. Some people have been in his employment for 30 years. Employers in the shirt, suit and jean segment of that industry do not have problems with productivity on the work floor. If one were to judge their productivity on a minute by minute basis one would see that they are as productive, if not more productive, than factories in other parts of the world. But the employers cannot compete when it costs them-I am dealing with one particular case-25c a minute as against an outlay of 1c a minute in parts of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> When we blithely say that we will scrap this industry, we are saying that at the end of the day we are not prepared to back the living standards of the working people in that industry. We can say, `Oh well, we will retrain them', but what do we do with a 45-year-old cutter? What do we do with a migrant woman who is a first rate seamstress, who knows only that and who is barely literate in her own language? What kind of training scheme will we produce to solve the problem of that industry? As my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) pointed out, when the textile industry was under pressure in the past, weavers just did not find other employment. </PARA>
<PARA> We should never forget when we are restructuring to become the clever country that those workers not only are workers, but also they are consumers. We cannot have it both ways. I believe that it is important, when we are talking about the clever country, to look at the economic reality. This country can build itself up on its basic resources. It is absurd that we are one of the prime beef producers in the world but that we export the skins to Paris, Japan and Pakistan and buy them back as value added product because we do not have anything that looks significantly like a tanning industry. We produce the finest merino wool in the world. If one buys a suit in Italy and asks how it will go in the heat, one will be told that it is the best Australian merino wool. But try to buy a Hong Kong shirt in the same shop!</PARA>
<PARA> For us simply to say that we are going to adopt the philosophy of the level playing field is not enough, because the level playing field can bury sections of Australian industry unless we are sensible about it. I do not believe that we should simply abandon a whole sector of industry when we are in a recession. I believe that the Government would be prudent to re-examine that aspect of its policy. Of course, there are areas that have to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan is the economic model. However, those who believe that Japan has developed its economic infrastructure on the basis of an equal playing field are kidding themselves. We only need recall the recent example of a trade fair in Japan when Australians turned up with a couple of packets of rice to see what occurred. We talk about the Japanese importing our beef. Everybody knows that that would raise the living standards of Japanese people as well as affecting our balance of payments. Have the Japanese adopted a level playing field?</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the structure of the Japanese and German economies, two of the most successful economies in the world, we see that those economies have been built by a close working relationship and a strategy adopted by their governments, which say, `We need these sorts of industries; we will provide an equity base for those industries to develop'. It has been government policy which has enabled that infrastructure to be developed. We cannot simply say that we abandon that approach, without further thought, because we are mesmerised by the free market economy. We can see what that philosophy produced in Great Britain under Thatcher. That is what we are being promised to no little extent by the unthinking approaches that are being adopted by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is a fallacy for my own Government, in the production of what is a very important statement, to not rethink some aspects of that statement. I think that we do have to look more seriously at the question of dumping. We have to develop an equity base. There has to be a closer working relationship between government and industry to provide the kind of equity base and the infrastructure which will enable our successful industries and our major research projects to be picked up and developed in Australia by Australian capital. If we have to provide taxation benefits and incentives to enable that to happen, then in my view that should occur. Having made those comments, I ask the Government to very seriously reconsider those aspects of its policy which I think can do untold harm to the textile industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it is appropriate to write that industry off. I believe that we need new approaches, but I reject entirely the view that the sector which should cop the blame is the trade union movement. If Australia has been failed over the last 10 years, it has been failed by a lack of ability and by a selfishness and greed that still dominate sectors of the corporate industry. I am not saying that this is so for all aspects of industry, but certainly I believe that the time has come for the Government and the corporate sector and its leaders to see how we can rebuild and restructure our future and our manufacturing industries in this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested to hear the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) because they demonstrated very clearly the quite proper distinction in approach among those in the Government ranks at present. I must say that I find a number of things to agree with in the comments of the honourable member. I was a bit disappointed that he would not lay any blame on the trade union movement, because whilst I am not one who suggests that the trade union movement is to blame for all the ills which beset Australia at present, I think that certainly rigidity within the trade union movement and the industrial relations field has led to a lot of the situations of difficulty that we find ourselves in at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must also say that I simply cannot support some of the attitudes of management in the Australian situation. I think there is a great deal to be done, both at the management level and at the trade union level, to bring about a realistic appreciation of the situation in which the nation finds itself. We should be seeking ways in which we can work together rather than antagonistically towards solving some of the very real problems that confront us. I do have some sympathy with the honourable member's statement that not all our competitors adopt the approach of that much overused phrase, `the level playing field'. I do not think they do. I really think that governments must take into account the realities of the international trading situation as well as the philosophy and the theory which underpin the approaches of the various centres of political thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement Building a Competitive Australia, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) presented to this House on 12 March, was almost universally reported by the media and other commentators in very qualified terms-that is understandable-such terms as, `half hearted', `not going far enough' and `too little too late'. Two newspapers even resorted to the Yes, Minister approach of describing the statement as being `courageous'. That is a word that one uses when one cannot think of any other realistic way of dealing with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Re-reading that statement after four weeks has brought home to me, and I suggest many other people, the realisation that its deficiencies are far more serious than just being, `too little too late'. In fact, the statement has two serious confessions of failure. Firstly, there is a confession by the Hawke Government that its much trumpeted achievement after seven years of economic management by the `world's best Treasurer' is nothing more than a fragile and an unstable economy that has crashed into one of the most rapid and severe recessions in the past 40 years. Secondly, and this is the real tragedy for the Australian people, is that the 12 March statement simply does not offer any worthwhile solutions to the hardships which now face thousands of Australian people and businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that one should not argue by analogy, but if I can offer an analogy, I understand that in rodeos, buck jumpers win their ride if they stay in the saddle for eight seconds. This Government has clung to the saddle for seven of those seconds, smugly thinking that it was in control of the situation, only to find itself loosing its grip in the eighth second and coming to the painful realisation that it had really not been in control at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Australian economy grew strongly through the first half of the 1980s, but this was not due to soundly developed policies which managed the direction and speed of that growth. Rather, to continue the analogy, the Government clung to the saddle as the economy took off after the crippling droughts of the late 1970s and was driven into frenzied activity with the deregulation of the financial and exchange markets, relaxed credit attitudes and a series of expansionary Budgets. What did this give Australia? It gave it a stock market boom of 1985-86 and a stock market bust in 1987; a property boom of 1988-89, and its bust; and the political entrepreneurship of Premiers Burke, Bannon and Cain-all, I might say, Labor Premiers-which caused the economic eclipse of their respective States. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the House to reflect for a moment on the balance sheet of economic achievements. On the one hand we have had crippling inflation in interest rates, a stampeding balance of payments deficit, Third World levels of foreign debt, national productivity figures that are falling further and further behind those of our major competitive nations, and a faltering attempt at some structural reform. On the other side of the ledger we have what? We have a declining standard of living, a disappearing manufacturing industry-we have just heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports talk about one aspect of that-no new and successful export industries, and a growing dependence on rural industries, with their inherently unstable and depressed prices. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the House back to the Prime Minister's speech of 12 March and draw attention to this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the challenges facing this country, everything flows from the fact that the days of our being able to hitch a free ride in a world clamouring, and prepared to pay high prices, for our rural and mineral products, are behind us. </PARA>
<PARA>This problem has been identified, acknowledged and addressed over and over again during the past two or more decades. I think it is a very sad day for this country that the Prime Minister must produce it in March 1991 as some newly discovered phenomena that, if properly addressed, will be the solution to our economic ills. What the Prime Minister is not saying is that eight years of a Labor Government have failed to make any significant gains in reshaping Australian manufacturing and exporting industries. Instead of that we are given homilies: We must all work together to `produce more than we spend'; `the rest of the world will not allow us to continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing from them'. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the Australian people do not need to be given such meaningless cliches. What they are asking us is this: where was responsible economic management when Australia's gross foreign debt reached $100 billion in September 1986? Was the Prime Minister `working together with the Australian people' when his policies took that debt to over $150 billion in March 1990? Why, after eight years of the world's best Treasurer, does that foreign debt continue to climb to the present unsustainable level of about $165 billion?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister put another challenging observation before the Australian people in his 12 March statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Australian production for imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, certainly we must. There is no disagreement with that. But that challenge existed in 1983. For the Prime Minister to have to repeat it in 1991 is a simple admission of eight years of failed policies, an admission that Labor's policies have not properly or successfully addressed the problem and that they still exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister asks us frequently to give him and his Government understanding and commitment. In return, he says that his Government will provide the right policy framework. The Prime Minister seriously misjudges the people of Australia. I suggest to him that Australians do understand the problems we face and have the enthusiasm and the commitment to meet whatever challenges are needed by way of solution. But they are suffering from a very understandable sense of frustration. They put their trust in the Hawke Government and that Government, quite simply, has failed them. The result is a people who no longer feel confident that the Hawke Government has the ability or the sense of purpose to put this country back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA> No one can dispute the validity of the Prime Minister's claim in his statement that our overriding objective must be to build a competitive Australia. But the factors that make Australia uncompetitive in relation to other trading nations are not some mysterious set of facts that only recently have come to light. They have been well identified over many years. Any Australian manufacturer will tell us that they are the productivity-wages nexus, the industrial relations system, unrealistic over-award conditions, and our transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia does not need to be told about is the need for a competitive nation. We want those well identified problems to be addressed in a businesslike manner and handled with a degree of urgency that reflects their seriousness. Quite simply, if Australia cannot create an efficient and expanded export industry and improve national productivity levels to equal or better than those of our competitive neighbours, we will have to reconcile ourselves to being the poor relations of our Asian neighbours. I say without fear of contradiction that not one of those fundamental objectives is properly addressed in the Prime Minister's statement-a document that is so grandly and incorrectly titled Building a Competitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that the Australian newspaper's editorial heading of 13 March read, `A competitive Hawke fails his own test'. Here we are sliding into one of the severest recessions seen in this country in the last 40 years, with over 9 per cent unemployed and an alarming rate of business failures, and the Prime Minister makes a major statement to the nation to tell us that the Government will get the right policy framework. We should just consider the significance of those words. In return, he offers us what? He offers us a general reduction in tariffs, reform to the anti-dumping system, some increased sales tax exemptions, minor changes to depreciation rates, and a continuation of the 125 per cent research and development tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA> What is abundantly clear is that the Government has not got its policy framework right and that the 12 March statement makes no significant contribution to that task. The nation's media has the same reservations, and a careful search of its comments will fail to find one single source that gives the statement more than qualified support. For example, it fails because of what it does not say. It is a modest step only. It is a campaign speech rather than an economic statement. It could result in industry being decimated instead of being rebuilt. That is hardly the response one would have expected if the statement had correctly projected itself to the policy needs appropriate to today's economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> What can we expect from a Prime Minister who cannot even be honest with the Australian people? He tells us:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is currently at or near the bottom of a downturn. </PARA>
<PARA>Just two sentences later he admits:</PARA>
<PARA> Higher unemployment is likely over coming months. </PARA>
<PARA>And finally:</PARA>
<PARA> The best estimate is that we will be coming out of the recession in the second half of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>We are used to the Government's rubbery budgetary estimates and have come to regard them with the credibility that most of us give our nightly weather forecasts. What we are seeing is a Prime Minister desperately trying to talk up the economy and desperately hoping that we are not about to witness another of its grand failures. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the House that this Government has been wrong on all major economic factors since 1983, including the non-existent J-curve, the terms of trade collapse in the mid-1980s, the stock market crash, the collapse of the assets markets, the damage from an uncontrolled credit boom, and the much vaunted soft landing that we should be enjoying right at this time. I would hope otherwise, but I fear that the Prime Minister's predictions of 12 March will be added to that sorry list. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has presided over seven years of frenzied and largely non-productive economic activity which encouraged excesses and personal greediness. The damage that is done to the Australian economy cannot be corrected in a few months or even a year. The economy has been seriously mishandled and destabilised. What the Australian people needed-and they deserved-on 12 March was an honest statement of what had gone wrong and a realistic and businesslike set of policies that would achieve a truly competitive Australia. It seems that that task will be left to another government at a future time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), who has just spoken, used the opportunity of this debate to have a very general discussion about economic policy. I plan to confine my remarks principally to those of this statement itself. I begin by saying it is certainly true that Australia does have a major current account deficit problem; that we have a current account deficit in the region of 5 per cent or 6 per cent of our gross domestic product; that it is absolutely essential for the Government to act decisively to reduce that deficit; and that the Government has chosen a number of policies in order to do that. Amongst those policies have been the restrictive macro-economic policies which are aimed at dampening economic demand so as to reduce the level of economic activity and reduce the level of imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those restrictive policies have included both a tight fiscal policy and high interest rates, and they have had the effect that was being sought in that the economy is now very flat indeed. That has had the effect of reducing the level of imports. That was a short run approach to coping with the current account deficit problem-in some ways at least, a necessary one. There is plenty of room for debate about the exact pattern of the policy that was adopted, but it was certainly necessary to reduce imports in one way or another. The policies that were adopted have had that effect and so in one sense at least they have been effective and successful. </PARA>
<PARA> But much more than that is required to address the current account deficit problem in the long term. It is not adequate just to reduce imports; we must increase exports. The purpose of this statement, Building a Competitive Australia, was to introduce a whole series of policies which would have the effect of increasing national productivity with the aim of increasing Australian competitiveness so as to build up our exports. That sort of structural change is absolutely essential to cope with the central economic problem of the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those on the other side who would argue that it was inefficient or ineffective or improper for the Government to be directly involved in influencing economic activity in this way. They are opposed ideologically to government intervention, but I think they fail to recognise the extent to which markets fail. Markets generally fail in Australia because in most of our industries there are only a few firms and therefore those firms have a high degree of market power. They are able to administer their prices and they use their market power to build up above-normal profits. In order therefore to increase not only the equity but also the efficiency of the economy, government intervention is essential. It is not an ideological statement to say that; it is simply a practical and realistic comment on the state of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot have in Australia an efficient, productive economy without active government intervention. These policies are exactly of that nature, and therefore most of them I wholeheartedly support. They are a very wide range of policies and they are well targeted. They are generally cost effective and, with minimal outlays or revenue forgone, they will have the effect of increasing Australian competitiveness. Take, for example, the taxation measures. The most important of those, the one that involves the largest amount of revenue forgone, is the exemption of wholesale sales tax on many inputs to goods production; that means that sales tax will be exempted for inputs to goods used by manufacturers, miners and primary producers in producing their goods and services. That is a very sensible policy. It does involve a considerable amount of revenue forgone-over $400m by 1993-94-but it is exactly the kind of well-targeted tax policy which will reduce costs of production and therefore increase the attractiveness of our manufactured goods when they are exported. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly well targeted are the simplifications to the depreciation provisions. I am not particularly happy, I must say, with the reductions in tariffs on luxury motor vehicles because I think the effect of that is to reduce the price of a completely unnecessary luxury item which will increase imports of it, and that is counterproductive. But that is a relatively minor part of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff reductions that have been announced are certainly controversial. Australia has been divided for 100 years over whether we should have high tariffs or low tariffs and the division about that issue cuts across all parties, and always has. I am of the view that, by and large, tariff reductions are sensible because they increase international competition; they do encourage countries to concentrate on the areas of production where they have what is called comparative advantage and they also open up markets to newer producers, particularly those in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a consensus broadly within the economics profession, and broadly amongst policy makers, that tariff reductions are desirable in principle. The problem is of course that they have substantial costs and those costs include loss of jobs in the industries where tariffs are reduced. Those industries are often concentrated in particular regions, so there is a particularly substantial impact on regions which will reduce employment and economic activity there. The Government has quite rightly announced with this package of measures a series of policies which will try to offset those costs to disadvantaged regions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of labour market policies, for example, aimed at retraining-the provision of training for potential retrenchees. There are additional funds for the Skillshare program; there are funds allocated for people to move from one part of the country to another to look for work; there are additional pre-vocational places including additional Austudy and so on-a whole series of labour market programs which will have the effect of trying to help people in the disadvantaged regions cope more effectively. So they are entirely desirable and very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are a number of other very constructive programs as well. There is increased funding for postgraduate research awards; they are one of the best targeted ways of increasing the national effort on research. There are additional funds for schools aimed at improving their effectiveness. There is a two-year program to stimulate new workplace culture, and a very eminent committee of industrialists to work on implementing that has accepted appointment. There are a series of fellowships for business people to study language and industrial management techniques in Asia-a relatively low cost program, only about $3m or $4m a year, but a very well-targeted program aimed at increasing our links with the very rapidly growing economies in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a guarantee for EFIC-the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation-to allow it to increase the amounts of trade which it insures, a very cost effective way of supporting trade. There are reductions in bounties and so on. These are all relatively low cost programs, well targeted, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of production in our manufacturing sector so as to increase the value of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), did not give adequate credit for the extent to which manufacturing exports have expanded. During the last six years, the real value of elaborately transformed manufacturing exports has grown by 12 per cent a year-that is, 12 per cent each year for the last six years. That is a very substantial improvement. In fact, our elaborately manufactured exports have grown faster than those of any other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country, except the United States. So policies have been effective in stimulating manufactured exports, though of course that is from a very small base and of course there is a lot longer to go. </PARA>
<PARA> One part of the package that was controversial was the resource security policy. That involves guaranteeing to the timber industry access to forests. The policy is wrapped around with a great many checks and balances. Any project has to go through a whole series of assessments before it will receive the guarantee at the end. It must be approved under environmental protection legislation, under heritage legislation; it must be approved under the provisions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legislation; and it must be supported by the Resource Assessment Commission. That is a very substantial series of checks that it has to pass before it can be approved. Once it is approved, legislation will guarantee access to timber. That may well be appropriate because, of course, we do have to build up the extent to which timber is cut in Australia so that we can reduce our timber imports. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I think, there is a very strong case for strengthening environmental security. I hope that out of the ecologically sustainable development program will come proposals for strengthening environmental security so that much more of our natural forests, our natural grasslands and our shores are preserved for all time, their future is guaranteed, either as national parks or as other forms of nature conservation areas, and future generations will have access to them. Provided that sufficient of those pristine areas are preserved, we can be sure that resource security is balanced by environmental security. I think that more work has to be done to expand and strengthen environmental security. </PARA>
<PARA> Other policies are also of course needed. This is not the occasion to go into those in any depth, but I would just like to conclude by emphasising the importance of building up the public infrastructure so as to improve national productivity and of spending more on every level of education. If we want to be the clever country, then we must substantially expand education at every level, particularly post-secondary education, the technical and further education colleges and the universities. It is very good to see that so many students want to go to university. I do not regret at all that there are over-enrolments at some universities this year. I hope that the Government will respond to that by increasing tertiary education funding, because that is perhaps the greatest contribution that government can make to building up our exports in the long run and to the economic development of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, it is important that we also build up our spending on research and development. There has been some improvement there, but there is still further to go. We must encourage research and development in both the public and the private sectors. With a strategy that includes those elements as well as those in this package, we will steadily move towards eliminating the current account deficit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The March industry statement made comment upon the information industries. Undoubtedly, there must be efforts by government to provide sensible opportunities for the industry to build on its strengths and gather momentum. The Government's comments bearing on the information sector recognise this, but hold out little for the relevant industries. The programs designed to promote higher standards across the industry deserve recognition. But the effort to extend bounty assistance to the printed circuit boards industry attests to the hostility of the economic environment which threatens to swallow this sector of the information industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a whole, the information industry was struggling to gain its footing in a highly competitive market when it was hit by high interest rates and recession. This has struck at the competitiveness of the fragile local industry. This has been particularly so in the software and components sectors, which depend on continuing demand from users. The disruption in demand caused by the recession as it built up over the last 18 months has badly damaged their competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession has also struck at investor confidence in the local industry. As many of these companies originated from small start-up companies, they are heavily dependent on external capital support, high stock turnovers and predictable cash flows. The engineered recession has diverted the local industry from its high growth path. It has destabilised business plans. It has made many companies believe that the race might not be worth the candle. </PARA>
<PARA> Growth in the Australian information industry sector has been slashed by half in the previous financial year alone. Already in the past year, the industry recorded its first drop in profit in 12 years, and growth has slipped behind the consumer price index movement. Investment has fallen 13 per cent and is still falling; and imports massively outweigh exports. In the PC-portable computer-market alone, growth is now half that of the 1989-90 financial year. The necessity to reconstruct the cost structures is not an imaginary one. The annual report of the Australian Information Industries Association indicates the direct relevance of productivity gains and lowered add-on costs to the sector's fundamental competitiveness. It needs the Government to provide for a level of business activity which will rekindle demand for its product and services. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is not a story just about a particular industry sector. Computing systems, networks and services are at the core of Australia's competitiveness, both at home and abroad. The information sector is the key to developing a genuinely internationalised economy. It improves performances across the entire manufacturing and services sectors. But what have we seen as a result of the engineered recession? Australian companies are cutting back on purchases. They are cutting their margins in order to retain some measure of viability. Their investment in computer systems and services was already low, at 1.3 per cent of average total sales turnover compared to 11 per cent in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> So what is happening now? What is happening is that, as business searches for survival in the midst of a recession, it cuts back on the very investments which underpin its competitiveness in the medium to long term. The result is that we are falling further and further behind in the race to build some measure of international competitiveness. I do not turn my back on all of the initiatives the Government has proposed over the course of its life. </PARA>
<PARA> But it needs to be understood that, for all of the efforts of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), his proposals in relation to the information industries sector must feed off a more competitive economic base if they are to amount to anything. In many respects, those various proposals emanating from the industry statement of 12 March simply sought to cover up the Government's inability to create an energetic industrial base. In respect of the whole investment climate, which so directly affects the information industries, if change is to come there have to be active market forces making for technological change, which will encourage further research and development as well as commercialisation within that sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot create policy settings in one's portfolio which ride on the back of improved across-economy performances. If one does, one will be forced back on to isolated compensatory measures, and measures-I should add in closing-which will have only marginal impact and create little by way of lasting change. </PARA>

In doing so, I refer to an article in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 5 April last entitled `The fairer sex remains smarter'. The article deals with a recent scientific study undertaken at the University of Pennsylvania, the findings of which indicate, most alarmingly, that, although both males and females lose brain cells as they age, the rate of atrophy is three times faster in men than in women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Pennsylvania study, involving 34 healthy men and 35 healthy women, all aged between 18 and 80, was coordinated by Professor Rubin Gur, Director of Pennsylvania University's brain behaviour laboratory and also a professor of neuropsychology, psychiatry and neurology. The study showed among its various findings that men's brains deteriorate faster, with cells dealing with language, reasoning and happiness falling out of the male mind in later age. It also showed that women lose brain cells from both sides of the brain at an equal rate. It is most alarming. Men lose cells from the left side, the flank associated with language, speech, logical reasoning and analytical thought, at twice the rate of cell loss on the right side of the brain. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Gur is quoted as saying as a result of all these disturbing findings:</PARA>
<PARA>So, if the argument for retiring from work is because of some loss in mental abilities, we have it all in reverse-men should be asked to retire earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>This is fearful food for thought. With advances in medical science leading to increased longevity in both males and females, can we in fact be heading for a world governed by a monstrous regiment of decisive, dominating doyens holding sway over a mob of melancholy male morons?</PARA>

We hear much about the incompetence and inability of Australian business to penetrate Asian markets. Commentators point to a lack of language skills, unfamiliarity with Asian business cultures and a general lack of experience. But, of course, with our previous reliance on the export of mostly unprocessed commodities and our high protective barriers, we have never had to try very hard in Asia. It is therefore not surprising that Australian business has found it difficult to exploit the ever increasing opportunities which high-growth Asia provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the days when commentators can glibly criticise Australian business are over, for it is now clear that Australian firms are meeting with success in Asia, and substantial success at that. Earlier decisions by a number of Australian companies to invest in Asia are now paying off handsomely. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansell, which is part of the Pacific Dunlop group, invested in Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka and has been rewarded by achieving dominance in the world market for various rubber products. BTR Nylex Ltd has been similarly successful, having invested in various Asian countries, but especially Taiwan and Malaysia. Its successes have been based around production of glass bottles and plastics and the company's return on its investment in Asia now matches the return from Europe and Australia. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Bundy Tubing Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd, Amcor Ltd, Burns Philp and Goodman Fielder Wattie are other Australian manufacturers who have substantially strong footholds in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian winemakers are also substantially increasing exports to several countries whose consumption of wine is rising along with their affluence. One South Australian winemaker, Adam Wynn of Springton in the Barossa Valley, has worked hard at establishing opportunities in Japan and has been rewarded by an increasing market there that has risen from nothing four years ago to 18,000 cases this year. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also becoming adept at winning smaller but nonetheless important niche markets in Asia. One example here is Unistat Pty Ltd, a company which produces labels, tags and various items of stationery. Unistat recently won a contract to become the exclusive supplier of specialised luggage labels to Singapore Airlines. Negotiations are now continuing with other Asian airlines but the firm's national sales manager expects his company to control 70 per cent of the regional market for this particular product within five years. But the company is not reliant on just one product and it now produces a diverse range of goods and sells them to Thailand, Korea, India, Brunei, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand and Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt so far with manufacturing concerns which export to Asian markets either from this country or from footholds within the Asian region itself. But Australian service firms are also achieving success, again belying the prevailing wisdom about the ability of Australian businesses. Several firms have demonstrated our economy's comparative advantage in the provision of various types of expertise. Kinhill Engineers, for example, which is based in Adelaide, has won a number of consultancy contracts for mineral developments in Indonesia. Others winning contracts in Asia include the Clough Engineering Group from Perth, W.L. Meinhardt and Partners Pty Ltd, Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd and Ove Arup and Partners, to name a few. The common features of the success of these firms has been their readiness and preparedness to establish offices in Asian cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a similar story with other service companies. Australian architects, quantity surveyors and construction companies have set up offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Several law firms and practices are also setting up in major Asian cities. These include firms such as Freehill Hollingdale and Page, and Allen Allen and Hemsley. I am pleased to note that one of the leading Adelaide law firms, Finlaysons, is also about to enter the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw three basic conclusions from these Australian success stories which I could enumerate at greater length-and probably will do in future speeches to this House. Firstly, I would like to reiterate that Australian companies have the talent to take advantage of market opportunities in a growing Asian economy. These examples provide evidence that the knockers are wrong, that Australian firms can compete in Asia both against rivals from within the Asian region and those coming from North America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, these examples suggest that, while certain branches of manufacturing will continue to be important, some of that manufacturing will often have to be conducted offshore in order to take advantage of local cost structures and avoid local protective barriers. Finally, it is quite clear that Australian business is responding to Government policy, which since 1983 has emphasised the internationalisation of our economy. Could anyone seriously believe that these business successes on such a broad front and so deeply achieved could have been achieved under the old dirigiste regime presented by the Liberal years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw to the attention of the House-and of the Senate and members of the parliamentary staff-the great honour and privilege that we will have next Wednesday at the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship meeting when we will have a former Australian cricket captain, Brian Booth, MBE, as speaker. That will be next Wednesday, 17 April at 7.30. It is planned that the breakfast will last for one hour and all members and senators and parliamentary staff are invited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to mention a couple of things that the scoreboard does not necessarily tell us about Brian Booth. I am sure they will be of interest to senators and members. Brian Booth has had a distinguished career in sport. He played in the New South Wales State hockey team from 1954 to 1960 and for Australia in the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. In cricket he represented both New South Wales and Australia. He scored 11,625 first class runs at an average of 45.52, with one double century, 26 centuries, 60 half-centuries and 21 ducks. </PARA>
<PARA> He scored 1,773 runs for Australia in 29 test matches with an average of 42.21. He scored five test centuries, with a highest score of 169 against South Africa. He scored 5,577 runs for New South Wales at an average of 43.57 in 93 matches. He represented Australia from 1961 to 1966 and toured England twice and was vice-captain. He toured India, Pakistan, the West Indies and New Zealand twice. More importantly, he captained the Australian team in two tests against England. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Booth recently retired from teaching after 35 years of service. At the time of his retirement he was Head of the Department of Physical Education at the Sydney Institute of Education. In 1980 Brian received an MBE for service to youth sport and the community. In 1974 he unsuccessfully stood for Federal Parliament, which some members may not know. He is currently a life member of the Melbourne Cricket Club, the New South Wales Cricket Association and the St George District Cricket Club, of which he is patron. He is a board member of the Teen Ranch at Cobbitty and Chairman of 2NBC FM radio station, which is a Christian radio station. He is an author, having written Hockey Fundamentals, Booth to Bat and Cricket and Christianity, which is the topic of his talk next Wednesday morning at the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship breakfast. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Booth is married with four daughters. His wife's name is Judy and she has a very strong involvement in the community, as we can imagine. I commend the breakfast to honourable members and senators and their staff next Wednesday morning-that is, 17 April-in the Private Dining Room starting at 7.30 sharp. Anybody who did not get the notice or who might be interested in coming will be more than welcome to ring my office and let me know he or she is attending that meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today this House saw a charade from the Opposition, which levelled charges against the Western Australian Government and against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Being a proud Queenslander and a fourth generation Queenslander, I took great exception to the hypocrisy and double standards from both the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia in coming into this House and talking about principle, honesty and reputation. Honourable members can see that I am holding up a brown paper bag. That is the way contracts were gained in Queensland for 32 years under the National Party. For 26 of those 32 years that was done with the support of the Liberal Party. For 26 of the 32 years the Liberal Party was prepared to lie down like a dog and allow the National Party not only to walk over it but also over the principles of democracy and representation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had representatives of large national companies come into my office-I will not mention or embarrass them here, but I have mentioned them to the Australian Federal Police-and tell me that they are sick and tired of paying 20 per cent off the top to get a contract in Queensland. That is why they will no longer apply for a contract under a National Party government in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we were subjected to nonsense about this false feeling about decency and integrity by an Opposition that knows full well that the National Party was bankrolled in Queensland. That was the heart of the National Party prior to 1987. It is not the heart of the National Party any more; it has only three members up there and they could hold their meetings in a phone booth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a few of them are. As the Prime Minister did today, I would like to challenge members of the Liberal Party, who come in here and play false games about accountability, to make accountability and exposure retrospective. Let us take it back to 1949, not 1975 or 1976 or 1982; let us put all the counts on the table. The Australian Labor Party is prepared to do that; we have nothing to hide. Let us put it on the table and see who bankrolled whom right across the board; let us see all the skeletons fall out of the closet. Wait until Sir Charles Court has to come to account too. Let us see, when we roll it all out, exactly where we all stand, because at the end of the day, as I said in the debate on the legislation dealing with uranium, the Labor Party is the only party which has a continuity of 100 years. It is the only party that has the emotion and compassion and is prepared to debate any issue at any time. It has been able to absorb and survive splits, divisions, war and depression; it has not changed its name or its principles. However, today we were subjected to the hypocrisy of two parties which have been bankrolled by the wealthy over the past 100 years at the expense of the poor and the working class of this country and which opposed the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax, the money from which is now going into family allowance supplement for farming families and low income working families and into home and community care for the aged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people on the other side of the House have the audacity to talk about principles, understanding and account- ability. It is interesting to note that one of the new members of this place, former Senator Fred Chaney, a Western Australian, has been silent throughout this whole debate. I do not know why he has been; maybe he knows a little more than some of us. However, let us shake all the skeletons out of the closet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has been the leading light in this demand for accountability. Let us look at two of the Liberal Party's leading lights in Queensland-Lane and Austin. Not only did they jump across the other side of the line and join the Nationals when it suited them, but also they have been convicted and gaoled for corruption. They are people who belonged to the same political parties as those whose members have the audacity to come into this House and tell us about accountability, which is something we have fought for since 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In May this year members of the Labor Party will stand underneath an old, gnarled tree in Barcaldine-the only thing which signified the hope and aspirations of working class people 100 years ago when a corrupt magistrate, led by a bunch of corrupt squatters, sent 600 troopers to arrest 13 strike leaders and sent them to gaol for four years. It is a similar story to what happened in Queensland over the 32 years prior to 1989. When we compare that and the struggle we have maintained for 100 years to succeed in being the only party that can be in government in every State and in the Commonwealth with the hypocrisy of members on the other side of this House, who represent only the butlers for the rich-not the servants for the people-it is rather ironic that they are prepared to come in here today and postulate about principles and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make accountability retrospective, and let us put the cards on the table about donations over the past 40 years. Let us see who stands up and how we match up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments will be brief. I am rather saddened by the contribution of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) for the simple reason that to engage in that generalised slur casts the whole profession of politics into question. If the member for Hinkler is alleging, as he is, that the major conservative parties in this country have been bankrolled since 1949, he just pulls down the whole standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the best of my knowledge there have been no allegations against any Federal politician of any side or any political party. To me, politics is in enough public disrepute without a member standing up and alleging that one side of the Parliament is so riddled with corruption that it goes back decade after decade. I believe the honourable member for Hinkler did the ideals and concept of public service no good. In my view it is absolutely stupid to make these blanket accusations. There have never been any allegations made by any member of his party against a conservative Federal member of Parliament. Where corruption arises-and he mentioned Lane and Austin in Queensland-the people involved should be charged and face the due processes of law. Nobody would leap to their defence. It is just crazy for politicians to engage in unsubstantiated accusations that pull the whole profession down. </PARA>

The honourable member made a quantum leap from decades of corruption and manipulation by big money interests into the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax. He may very well disagree with the views of the coalition on those two taxes, but it is a legitimate debate and there is nothing corrupt about opposing a capital gains tax. I would be very interested to know whether the Australian Federal Police are acting upon information the honourable member for Hinkler told us he had passed to them regarding large companies which have tired of paying some 20 per cent under the National Party Government. Presumably we can expect some developments in that area--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a member of this House for only a relatively short time and I admit that I have a lot to learn, but this afternoon I witnessed, in the address to this House by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), probably the most blatant example of hypocrisy that one could ever hope to see or imagine. We heard the Federal Leader of a Party whose Ministers in Queensland and, to a lesser extent, in New South Wales have been discredited. In Queensland many of them are on parole, on trial, in gaol or awaiting trial for corruption. We do not have any vague allegations about this. We do not have any suggestions that donating to a political party is somehow criminal. They are specific charges that have been laid against National Party members. They are charges that have been proved in the cases of Austin, Lane and Harvey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Bradford interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McPherson should get no glee from this. Austin and Lane, during the time of their offences and at the time of their corruption, were members of the Liberal Party and were Liberal Party Ministers. So I would take no joy at all, if I were the honourable member for McPherson, from the record of my Party. Fellow Liberal Party Ministers sat in that Cabinet and quite happily accepted what was going on, what was the norm, what was the accepted practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party raised allegations about the propriety of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the question of the donation by Mr Connell. What happened to his predecessor as Leader of the National Party of Australia? How did the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) get the job? He got to the job because we had the unprecedented example in Australian political history of the leader of a major political party being beaten at the poll. This was, of course, Mr Blunt, the former member for Richmond. What is Mr Blunt known as now? He is known as the echidna because he has such a sticky tongue from licking all the postage stamps. He sent letters to literally hundreds of thousands of households in this country. He did not send them in his own electorate; no wonder he was beaten. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) spoke about specific allegations and things being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. I know as a matter of fact, because the Federal Police have contacted my office and asked for details of letters that were sent by the former Leader of the National Party, that there are investigations into whether he breached his postal allowance entitlement as a political leader. That investigation is going on at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> So I would not be so pious, if I were the honourable member for Farrer, about coming in here and pointing fingers and raising allegations about corruption and priority. He has a lot to answer for in relation to his own Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me run through the names. We have Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, currently on charges of official corruption, awaiting trial. We have Ivan Gibbs, one of the most senior National Party Ministers, currently facing corruption charges for misappropriation of public funds. </PARA>

We have Geoff Muntz currently on trial for the same thing. We have Russ Hinze also facing charges of official corruption. We have Mr George Herscu, who has already been convicted on charges of his bribery of Russ Hinze, the National Party Minister for everything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How dare the honourable member for Farrer come into this House and cast aspersions on the Prime Minister.

<PARA> It is emphasised that only approved items outlined in Sub-section (ii) of this Appendix are to be allowed in cells.'</PARA>
<PARA>(9) The Department of Corrective Services (NSW) has advised that the answer is `yes' and the policy is in the Prisoner Property Policy, which is set out in the answer to question 8.</PARA>
<PARA>(10) The Department of Corrective Services has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA>`No possessions were disposed of as such. Inmates were requested to have non-approved items collected by family or friends.'</PARA>
<PARA>(11) No. On 12 October 1990 my Department wrote to the Director-General, Department of Corrections (NSW) seeking information about a number of matters, including the Department's new policy on personal possessions. I understand that the Human Rights Commissioner is investigating allegations by federal prisoners that conditions in NSW prisons violate their human rights but that the Commissioner has not yet finalised that process. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the function of inquiring into Commonwealth acts or practices which may be inconsistent with Australia's human rights obligations. This inquiry function extends to the imprisonment of federal offenders in State and Territory institutions. The Commission may seek to settle the matter or alternatively it may report to the Commonwealth Government if it is of the opinion that an act or practice is inconsistent with any human right. The Commission has not yet made any report to the Commonwealth on the situation of federal prisoners in NSW prisons.</PARA>
<PARA>(12) No.</PARA>
<PARA>(13) The Department of Corrective Services has provided the following answer to this question:</PARA>
<PARA>No federal offenders have attempted suicide since 19 September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>(14) I have general responsibility for federal prisoners but I am not involved in the day to day matters of prison administration which are State/Territory responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>(15) There are no formal arrangements. There are a number of international human rights instruments which are relevant to the treatment of prisoners. The Human Rights and Equal Rights Commission is the body established by the Commonwealth to investigate allegations of human rights violations such as allegations made in relation to federal prisoners held in State/Territory prisons.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Did the Standing Committee have time at its meeting on 7-8 February 1991 to consider an Australian declaration under Article 14 of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; if not, when is the Standing Committee scheduled to hold its next meeting.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australian accession to the First Optional Protocol is not a matter which requires agreement by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Rather, the question is one for decision of the Australian Government. The Standing Committee is, however, a valuable forum for discussion and consultation with the States and Territories on such issues, and the Government will make its decision on accession in the light of that discussion and consultation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The question of Australia making a declaration under Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination will not be on the agenda of the Standing Committee until the issue of Australian accession to the First Optional Protocol has been finalised. The next meeting of the Standing Committee will be held on 20-21 June 1991.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has informed me that the Commission is not provided with information from Aboriginal legal services on a case-by-case basis. Whilst receiving most of their funds from the Commonwealth, the legal services are independent organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Whilst some Aboriginals undoubtedly are unrepresented when they appear before the courts, I am informed that there is no reliable data on the numbers involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Responsibility for determining priorities for funding now rests with elected Regional Councils, in the first instance, and with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission itself. Management of Aboriginal legal services must therefore ensure that, in competing for a proportion of the overall funds available, they reflect the priorities of the elected representatives of the community which they serve.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Lancelin Training Area (LTA), which is the Army-controlled portion of the Lancelin Defence Area (LDA), has been used by Army for field training and firing, including artillery and armour, for over forty years. The major Army activity includes armoured personnel carrier battle runs, artillery, mortar and small arms firings. The LTA is the only range available for live firings within the Fifth Military District. A major exercise is conducted on the LTA with United States forces on a biennial basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The LDA also includes a Commonwealth-owned Naval Gunnery Impact area and a Commonwealth-leased Navy Overshoot area, and is also used for non-firing purposes including driver training, fieldcraft, navigation, infantry minor tactics, field engineer training and amphibious landings. As the LTA is close to Perth it is the major training area for Perth-based Regular Army and Reserve units.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The LDA extends from the beach inland and it is not possible for a road to pass between the range and the coast. A road through the LDA would seriously compromise its use for manoeuvre and firing exercises.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are currently no roads through or in the area of the LDA except for the main highway which passes well inland. The Department of Defence is not aware of any extra costs being imposed on State road construction or on diversion of power grids lines as such questions have never been raised with Defence by the WA Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As Defence is unaware of any such additional costs being raised with the Commonwealth, the issue does not arise.</PARA>
