<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the Committee entitled Follow the Yellow Brick Road-The Final Report on an Efficiency Audit of the Australian Taxation Office: International Profit Shifting, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which I have tabled today is the third report by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on its inquiry into international profit shifting. In the previous Parliament the Committee tabled two reports on this inquiry, namely Shifting the Tax Burden? and Tax Payers or Tax Players. The first report dealt with aspects of the administration while the second report focused on tax havens. The second report acted as a catalyst for the introduction of legislation dealing with tax havens just last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this third report the Committee has focused on the issue of tax avoidance arising from the withholding tax provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Those provisions deal with a tax which is withheld from interest and dividends earned within Australia by non-residents. In the report the Committee also has considered aspects of the cash transactions reporting system relevant to international profit shifting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's interest in investigating the withholding tax area arose as a result of allegations made by Melbourne academic Ms Barbara Smith. Ms Smith alleged that Australian residents were establishing arrangements which took advantage of the low rate of interest withholding tax to reduce and even avoid their income tax obligations. During the inquiry, it became evident that the withholding tax area has been left to float in the backwater of taxation administration and policy. Treasury officials told the Committee that no formal review of withholding tax rates had been conducted since the system was introduced in 1967. Australian Taxation Office representatives advised of the lesser priority directed to the withholding tax area, as compared with other areas of taxation administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee itself gained first-hand experience of this during inspections in Melbourne and Sydney. The Committee came to the conclusion that the low priority accorded to the withholding tax area, coupled with a lack of adequate administrative controls, had been important factors contributing to the abuse of the withholding tax provisions identified to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In its task the Committee was not distracted by the debate which ensued about the amount of taxation revenue which may have been lost as a result of tax avoidance arrangements established to take advantage of the withholding tax provisions. It considered that the problem was significant enough to warrant attention and, accordingly, directed its efforts towards determining how best to deal with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the Committee has made a number of substantial recommendations aimed at strengthening the legislative and administrative framework for combating tax avoidance in this area. It has also addressed some of the broader issues relating to the equity of the taxation system which were identified during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the primary considerations for the Committee was the appropriateness of retaining the existing 10 per cent rate of interest withholding tax. The Committee found that one consequence of the existing low rate for non-residents is that it has provided some Australian residents with a potential to establish arrangements aimed at reducing and even evading their income tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered proposals to increase the rate of interest withholding tax across the board and to have differential rates of withholding tax applying to countries with which Australia has and has not entered into double taxation agreements. However, from the evidence it received, the Committee was unable to evaluate in detail the full economic implications of these proposals and, in particular, the impact which they would have on Australia's ability to attract foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, nevertheless, is concerned that greater attention has not been focused previously on whether the withholding tax rates which were set in the 1960s are still in the best interests of Australia. Accordingly, we have recommended that the Industry Commission conduct a comprehensive review of the withholding tax system as part of its existing inquiry into the availability of capital. The particular matters which need to be addressed in that review are detailed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Pending the outcome of the Industry Commission's review, the Committee has recommended a discretionary power for the Commissioner of Taxation, which would allow the Commissioner to impose the top marginal rate of tax, rather than the withholding tax rate, in cases where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the interest income derived by a non-resident from an Australian source relates to an arrangement established by an Australian resident for tax avoidance purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report the Committee also has addressed the concerns which were raised about discretionary trusts being a principal vehicle for tax avoidance involving the withholding tax provisions. The Committee considered that the use of discretionary trusts for purely tax avoidance purposes is a negative consequence of the differing approaches which have been adopted towards the taxation of trusts and corporations. We therefore indicated that there is a need for fundamental reform in this area by recommending that there should be a move towards a system of taxing trusts and corporations in a uniform manner.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of this recommendation may take time because of the need to consider the broader economic and social implications which may arise as a consequence. In the interim, to address the issue of tax avoidance through trusts the Committee has recommended the removal of the tax advantages which can accrue in arrangements which rely on the streaming of interest income through a trust to a non-resident. </PARA>
<PARA> A further allegation raised in the Committee and addressed in the report involved the use of overseas charities in tax avoidance arrangements. It was claimed that schemes are operating whereby trust distributions to overseas charities are returned ultimately to the original donor. The net effect of the schemes was purported to be a lowering of the resident trust tax liability. However the Committee did not receive substantial evidence that overseas charity schemes are being perpetrated in Australia on any significant scale. Nevertheless, we became aware that there are concerns within the Tax Office about the potential for tax avoidance in this area. To address these concerns the Committee recommended the introduction of a specific anti-avoidance measure aimed at eradicating the potential for tax avoidance hidden in the guise of donations to charities. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to withholding tax administration, the Committee was concerned particularly about the adequacy of the existing procedures for verifying that those who claimed to be non-residents are actually non-residents. We agree with the Tax Office that the exemption for non-residents from the new tax file number requirements is a problem which needs to be addressed and to remedy the situation the Committee has recommended that the tax file number system be modified to incorporate non-resident verification procedures. Additionally, we have recommended that as part of the non-resident verification procedure the Tax Office should seek to identify those non-residents acting in the capacity of trustee for Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consideration for the Committee was the Tax Office's ability to gather evidence from overseas. In this regard we have recommended that taxation agreements with countries which have comparable taxation regimes to Australia be pursued actively, that anti-treaty shopping provisions be included in taxation agreements and that Tax Office representatives be posted overseas to facilitate information exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report the Committee also highlighted the importance of prosecution action as a weapon against tax avoidance arrangements. We have recommended that prosecutions should be pursued vigorously against both the promoters of and participants in tax avoidance arrangements and such prosecutions should be publicised widely. </PARA>
<PARA> The final chapter of the report deals with the Cash Transactions Report Act. This inquiry is the first opportunity which the Parliament has had to review aspects of the cash transactions reporting system since its introduction. The reporting system was established to inhibit tax evasion, money laundering and other fraud and crime. We have recognised that the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) provides a valuable source of information for the Tax Office and law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat tax evasion and crimes, but one deficiency was identified. The reporting system focuses on cash movements in transactions, not on telegraphic and wire transfer of funds overseas. As these telegraphic transfers are the most appropriate means by which funds from Australia are channelled overseas the Committee considers that the capture and analysis of telegraphic transfer data would add a significant dimension to the information available to the Tax Office and law enforcement agencies. We are pleased to see that on the advice of the Attorney-General the Cash Transaction Reports Agency has commenced investigation into the possibility of including an existing arrangement to monitor the telegraphic transfers and therefore to report back through that agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly this report presents a number of substantial recommendations aimed at combating deficiencies identified by the Committee in the withholding cash and cash transaction reporting systems. I take this opportunity to thank my fellow members of the subcommittee appointed to conduct the inquiry, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). I additionally thank the subcommittee secretary, Mr Andres Lomp and our very good friend and adviser Mr Lawrie Hill, a secondee from the Australian Taxation Office, and also Ms Laura Gillies who was responsible for typing the report. </PARA>
<PARA> With the tabling of the Committee's third report on this subject area, the Committee is in a position to conclude that for some the road of international profit shifting truly is paved with gold. Implementation of the Committee's recommendations in this report, however, will ensure that those who choose to follow the yellow brick road at least will have to pay the appropriate toll. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report tabled by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) contains very substantial recommendations. Their urgent implementation is essential if our tax laws are to be fair to Australians and foreigners, as well as being fair as between Australians.

Many of them call for improvement in the administrative arrangements of the Tax Office and the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. These recommendations can all be read in the report. Because of the limited time available to me I will not comment or attempt to summarise these recommendations other than to say that the implementation of the administrative changes recommended will help to reduce the loss of revenue due to international profit shifting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report does, however, contain other recommendations, the implementation of which will involve the Government in decisions of a policy nature. These recommendations, if implemented, will have far reaching effects. I will now briefly comment on three issues dealt with by these policy related recommendations. First, I will deal with a call for a comprehensive review of the withholding tax system and the basis upon which we should enter double taxation agreements. Second, I will refer to the call for the taxation of trusts in the same manner as we tax corporations. Third, I will speak about the call for greater transparency with respect to the tax deductibility of qualifying donations and the exemptions from tax of trust income distributions to charities. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the first issue, the Committee has recommended that Australia's tax withholding system be referred to the Industry Commission for a comprehensive review as part of its current inquiry into the availability of capital. It did this because it did not believe it had the time or the resources to go into all the ramifications of such matters as the appropriateness or otherwise of retaining the existing rate of withholding tax; the appropriateness or otherwise of having a common rate of interest withholding tax applied to interest income earned in Australia by non-residents living in tax treaty and non-treaty countries; the equity of tax sharing arrangements between Australia and other countries, particularly whether the primary right of taxation should be retained by the country of source of income; the equity of the tax treatment between residents and non-resident individual investors and between Australian owned and foreign owned enterprises; and, finally, the adequacy of the current thin capitalisation rules. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the consideration I have been able to give to these issues, my predisposition is that our approach to the taxation of Australian sourced income of non-residents should be based first upon the claim that we have the primary right to tax all income derived in Australia and, secondly, that the rate of withholding tax should be raised to a level equivalent to the corporate rate of tax, which rate should be reduced so that it is no more than 30c in the dollar. Thirdly, a lower rate of withholding tax should be payable on interest and unfranked dividends paid to investors resident in countries whose tax regimes are similar to our own. Fourthly, an even lower rate of withholding tax should be levied where the non-resident investor is resident of a country with which we have a comprehensive double taxation agreement. Fifthly, the existing double taxation agreements should be renegotiated and new agreements negotiated to provide us with the right to impose interest withholding tax up to a rate not exceeding 30c in the dollar. Except when varied by tax treaty, such a tax regime would enable us to remove the difference between the tax rates now imposed on company and other business entity profits and the much lower rate imposed on interest paid by those enterprises out of their pre-interest, pre-tax profits. I urge the Industry Commission to take careful note of the issues the Committee wants reviewed. I hope it will not be overwhelmed by the argument that we must attract foreign capital at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that higher domestic savings must be encouraged and sustainable levels of foreign investment permitted. But profits, dividends and interest income sourced in Australia should be subject to the same tax burdens, whether the investor is resident in Australia or not. Any relief from this burden should be granted only either as a consequence of double tax agreements under which there is an acceptable quid pro quo in Australia's favour, or through explicit and costed tax rebates or rate reductions aimed at achieving economic outcomes which adequately benefit Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second major recommendation of the report, namely, that we move to a standardisation of the tax treatment of all business income, whether the income is derived by a company or a trust. I think we should have a uniform taxing system for companies, trusts, partnerships and other forms of family arrangements and business activities, whether owned by, or operated for the benefit of, residents or non-residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Committee goes only so far as to recommend the taxation of trusts in a manner similar to corporations. This would involve extending the imputation system used in respect of company taxation to avoid the double taxation of taxed trust income. Such a change would take away the tax advantages now available to a privileged class of taxpayers who are in a position to arrange their affairs so as to move income through the most tax effective business vehicles and family arrangements. This behaviour is rational, legal behaviour and conforms with the court confirmed principle that no man in this country-as occurred in the United Kingdom, where the judgment of the court was given-is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his legal relations to his business or to his property as to enable the Tax Commissioner to put the largest possible shovel into his stores. But it is the responsibility of legislators and policy makers that, when circumstances warrant, they restore tax equity between those who are able to organise their affairs to be tax effective and those who cannot do so. </PARA>
<PARA> A uniform taxation system for companies and trusts, and eventually partnerships as well, and other vehicles used for conducting family arrangements and business activities would ensure that the vehicle is tax neutral to the individuals who ultimately benefit from the taxable activity. This can be achieved only when the primary rate of tax payable by all types of entities used in engaging in taxable activity is the same, and only when that rate coincides with the highest marginal rate payable by individuals. That means that the top marginal rate payable by an individual should be the same as the top corporate rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to those recommendations which relate to tax deductible gifts to charities and other organisations coming within the ambit of section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the distribution of trust income to charitable organisations within and without Australia. There is a need not only for the improvement of the administrative arrangements, but also for reform of the law under which tax deductibility can be claimed in respect of donations to charitable and other organisations, as well as reform of the law under which trust income distributions to charitable organisations overseas are exempted from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that policy makers have the information necessary to enable them to assess the appropriateness of existing mechanisms for supporting charities within the taxation system. I hope the implementation of the Committee's recommendations will establish this transparency. The time may then come when, in the interests of the many genuine organisations with tax deductible status and those who are equally genuine but have not been granted that status, the Tax Office will develop a program which will enable it to match donations claimed with those received. In the case of overseas charities, it may become necessary to limit the tax exempt status of distributions to charities to those in respect of which the tax authority of the countries in which they are based can provide regular verification that the funds so distributed are received by such charities and are used for a charitable purpose. It may be fairer to Australian taxpayers if such organisations were to be made subject to an approval process such as that required by overseas aid organisations in seeking tax deductibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope it will not be too long before the Parliament is asked to implement major reforms of our withholding tax arrangements, our double tax agreements, the law providing for tax deductibility or exemption of donations and distributions to charities, and especially to achieve uniformity in the approach to taxation of companies, trusts, partnerships and other like arrangements. I join the Chairman of the Committee in thanking members of the staff, Andres Lomp and Lawrie Hill, and hope that it will not be long before the recommendations are acted upon. </PARA>

<PARA> That the House take note of the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled The Injured Coastline-Protection of the Coastal Environment, comes before this House after an inquiry which received submissions from around Australia from almost every conceivable source. Moreover, Committee members were able to visit centres and see and hear at first hand what is happening to the Australian coastline. The message is clear: this Parliament has the responsibility for doing something about a problem that threatens the well-being of the coastline and waters that lap our shores and, as a result, the well-being of Australians and their environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The electorate of Richmond, which I have the honour to represent, is, as honourable members know, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Indeed, the population of the north coast of New South Wales is predicted to reach over 700,000 by the year 2016, almost double the population of the 1986 census. </PARA>
<PARA> When the discussion paper which preceded this valuable report was released last year, my offices in Lismore and South Tweed were inundated with requests for copies of the paper. The requests came from all sections of the population-from environmental groups, local government, industry and developers. In all, over 200 requests for the paper were received. Following such a deluge of requests, the Committee visited Byron Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> The message that was repeated over and over again at those meetings by people was that they were sick to death of inquiries from governments and that they believed that now was the time for action. Developers also said that they would welcome clear guidelines, and that they were devastated by the rules imposed by local and State authorities continually changing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that in some respects there has been a lack of political will by decision makers at the various levels of government to confront and deal with the problems of the coastal zone because they are so complex. What has occurred is that a host of small, ad hoc decisions have been made almost on the run by decision makers to deal with whatever happens to be the present pressure. We see over and over again the resulting impact on the environment from what has been aptly called the tyranny of small decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when authorities set out to protect the coastal complex of wetlands and the life they sustain, the cumulative effects of many small decisions and many small developments have proved to be devastating to the environment. All of those pressures are upon the coastline right around Australia. They are present in my own electorate. The desire of people to live near the ocean continues to heap pressure upon pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Richmond this has led to conflict between groups struggling for the preservation of unique sites and those groups who see those sites as development sites. Even now, at the mouth of the Richmond River, just to the south of my electorate, bulldozers are moving in to destroy what is virtually the last of the Aboriginal midden sites and what is stated to be a burial site at North Creek in Ballina. Further up the coast there is an ongoing battle to preserve the Fingal Peninsula from being lost to the people. Again, debate continues about whether a road should be built through the wetlands in order to allow fishermen assured access to the beach. Further north in the same area a quarry operates on a site which demands protection. These and similar situations have led to conflict between groups and ad hoc decisions have been made by those who have had the responsibility for making those decisions. The case for Commonwealth coordination could not be greater. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to clear up a misrepresentation of the report carried by some sections of the media. It was reported in the Telegraph Mirror on 12 April that a levy was to be struck to pay for a coastal clean-up. No such recommendation was made by the Committee in its report; rather, the Committee recommended that a national coastal management strategy be developed by the Commonwealth in cooperation with the States and Territories, which, with other features, would be incorporated into Federal coastal management legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that the public now demands action about the condition of the coast. As the Committee Chair said in her address to this House, the Commonwealth's activities in the coastal zone at present are ad hoc, uncoordinated and lacking in focus. This report is about redressing that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for Commonwealth coordination could not be clearer when one considers the present situation in New South Wales. In that State, a report from a bipartisan upper House committee will recommend that the Greiner-Murray Government recognise and acknowledge the failings of the present coastal planning and management system in New South Wales. The Government of New South Wales is accused of lacking vision, but I would put it a different way: I would say that the Greiner-Murray Government has a vision for the coastline, but it is very different from the one the rest of us have. Those who know the north coast of New South Wales will remember the problems caused by the National Party's concrete proposals. That Party is hell-bent on development, no matter what the cost to the environment. It is clear that not all members of the Greiner-Murray Government are like Tim Moore. That is why the conflict will continue. There is no trust in what the New South Wales coalition Government will do. That leaves developers and environmentalists blaming each other when the cause of the conflict lies with the actions of the Government making the rules. Already the Premier of New South Wales has been reported as dismissing the recommendations of that report. </PARA>
<PARA> Management of the coastal zone is also a matter of growing international concern. A working group of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is currently conducting a project on the integration of environmental considerations into coastal zone management in member countries. The Committee learned during the inquiry that a section of the south-east Tasmanian coast provided the Australian case study for the project. The OECD coastal group is, among other things, examining the desirability of national governments developing coordination mechanisms and overall policy guidelines for coastal management for regional and local government. It is worth while noting that the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts are in line with the general approach to coastal management likely to be taken by the OECD group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has developed and maintained close contact with the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) regarding its inquiry into the coastal zone, and the report identifies areas which the Commission may wish to explore further. The Committee believes that coastal management initiatives by the Commonwealth should not await the report by the RAC inquiry into the coastal built environment. The Commission's report should be used to improve, direct, assist and guide such policies, structures and plans as are in place or are being prepared at the time of reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate one recommendation of the Committee which I feel is most important and which, after the time spent on this report, goes to the crux of what the Committee members desire for action and where that action should come from. That recommendation is recommendation No. 12, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Following preparation and development of a national coastal zone management strategy, the Commonwealth enact legislation which sets out a Federal interest in the coastal zone, agreed national objectives, agreed national and environment guidelines and standards-including standards for water quality and industrial waste discharge-and financial assistance schemes to assist the States and local government to formulate coastal management plans and policies that are consistent with the objectives and goals of the national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I thank the members of the Committee and the staff, including David Crawford. It has been a pleasure to work with members of both sides of the House on this Committee. It is the first committee that I have functioned on, although I am certain it will not be the last; however, working so well with members from different parties has been an education and it has given me an insight into the workings of government. It is a great pleasure to commend this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by endorsing the remarks made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). I, too, have very much enjoyed working with members from both sides of the House on the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I commend this Committee report to the House, because I think it is an extremely important report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that too much in this House and in this Government-as in all governments-there is a tendency when there is a problem to say, `Let's have a report', and that in producing the report, there is a feeling that we have done the job, we have talked about it and we have a report. This is an important report that needs not just to be filed away; it needs definite action. What we have on our coast now is akin to a national disaster. Australia has a coast which started off in a natural pristine state but which now has 75 per cent of the Australian population living on it. That is causing enormous degradation to that coastline; it is causing degradation through sewage, through development and through deposits of nitrogen and phosphorus, which from way back have entered the river systems as run-off from farming lands and are carried out into the sea. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own area of South Australia, which the Committee visited, we saw the effect of urban water run-off on the waters of the St Vincent Gulf. We have streams coming from agricultural communities where the dogs, cats, cows, ducks and everything else go into the water, leaving their refuse in the water, which flows down the streams, picking up all the silt, dirt and grime that comes off the roads, and then straight into the Gulf. That is a particularly bad instance of urban water run-off, but it was not the only instance. This is happening all over the coast and at the moment very little is being done about it. Part of the problem is that responsibility for the coast has been given to the States. The States see the coast as part of their areas, yet when one looks at the definitions of `coast' that the various States have, one finds that their definitions are different. Some States will look at the coast as that very little bit of water that laps onto the sand, whereas others will define it as an area that goes much further inland and much further out to sea. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned urban water run-off because that was particularly bad in my State of South Australia, as we saw at the Patawalonga. Let me say that there are much worse instances around the coast. We all know of Bondi and the raw sewage that goes out and back into our famous beaches at Bondi. Bondi was once the symbol of Australia, where overseas people saw the beach with our great lifesavers on the white sands. Now there are days when one cannot swim at Bondi because it is a health hazard. But Bondi is not an isolated instance. The Committee saw that this is happening elsewhere along the coast. We saw that down at Lorne and similar places sewage is still being pumped into the sea. Not only is it being pumped into the sea, but also some of the water boards doing that have an old-fashioned attitude that that is an acceptable practice and that the sea is there to have sewage dumped into it. That is not what the sea is there for, and if we keep dumping sewage into it, we will lose more of the sea grasses and our fisheries. We are doing enormous damage to the seas by pumping our sewage into them. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Committee's activities, we went to see Memtech Ltd, an organisation in New South Wales which is looking at a technological solution to these problems. I am surprised that we have not taken up the options offered by Memtech, because its process is an Australian process and one which is very technologically advanced and could solve many of our problems in putting sewage out into the sea. There are some moves to use it in New South Wales, but as far as I can see, it has not been taken up with the vigour that it should be. The only reasons I can see to explain this are not just related to the cost, because the cost of pumping sewage into the sea is enormous anyway, but that it is such new technology that people are reluctant to embrace it and many of the water boards still have very old-fashioned attitudes to this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The member for Richmond referred to the `tyranny of small decisions'. Indeed, that is what we are suffering from on our coast-the tyranny of small decisions. Much of the responsibility for the coast is that of small councils which have very narrow resource bases, yet they have to make decisions about the types of development that go along their piece of the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> When those councils say, `All right, we will give that natural piece of pristine coastline for development', they are actually saying, `It really doesn't matter, because it is only this little bit'. However, it does matter, because with a council making that decision, the adjacent council along the coast will make the same decision, and so will the next one, so that we have this tyranny of small decisions and end up with what we have on the east coast, where 70 per cent of our wetlands have now disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA> In case it is thought this is not important, these are wetlands which filter our waters near the coast, and these are wetlands where fish breed. So it is essential that we stop the process now before it goes too far. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Committee was to see whether the Commonwealth in fact has a role in the coast, and it does. It has a role to coordinate those bodies which are at present looking after the coast, to provide some national guidelines for those bodies. It does not need another role as a draconian level of government; we have enough of that already on the coast. We now need coordination. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks for all the help of the very hardworking secretariat, who particularly asked me not to mention the actual fun we had in going around the coast. But let me put that in; it really was quite a delightful trip. I think I shall remember for a long time the time we had in Broome. Although we were only there for 1 1/2 days, I feel I saw the whole of the Broome area. One of my concerns now for the future, perhaps, is what will happen in that area, and I have some terrible fear of going back one day and finding, next to that beautiful, natural wonderland-the aquamarine water and the red soil-a giant pearl at the gates of Broome saying, `Welcome to Broome'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in speaking in this debate to note the report entitled The Injured Coastline: Protection of the Coastal Environment, the report of the House of House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. As has been mentioned in the tabling statements of the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), as Chair, and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), as Deputy Chair, and the contributions of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), the Committee did make extensive inspections of a wide variety of coastal situations around Australia. Whilst a number of those coastal environments are different, there are great similarities in our ability as a nation to appropriately control what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we reflect upon the number of inquiries already held about the coast, one would suspect that now is really the time to get some coordinated action about the management of the coast. Let me refer back to the predecessor of this present House of Representatives Committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. Back in 1980 it reported on the management of the coastal zone. If we compare the recommendations of that Committee with the recommendations that appear in the report The Injured Coastline, there are definitely some similarities. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1980 there were recommendations that whilst State and local governments had recognised the importance of the coast, they often lacked the resources to undertake research or preparation of management plans. Again this was something the Committee found as it toured around, especially with regard to local government. Due to the size of local government and the resources which are available to local government-compared with the types of things they are required by legislation to investigate-often a great deal of support is required to enable them to carry out their role appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980 report referred to aspects of coastal planning where national interests should override State or local interests. I think in most inquiries of committees of this place, one of the recurring themes can be what are seen to be the difficulties of controlling things at a national level as a result of our federal system of government, particularly the way in which we divide responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the State. This inquiry was no different. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Hawker said, it is not a matter, at a national level, of dictating what should happen, but it is certainly a requirement at a national level that we should have appropriate guidelines and we should give appropriate leadership so that the other spheres of government, and those groups within the community which have an interest, can get on with the job. When we say there is a responsibility at the national level to be involved, that is all we are saying. There is a responsibility at the national level to be involved in appropriate research, there is responsibility at the national level to set appropriate guidelines, but there is also a responsibility at the local level to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose another recurring theme in this inquiry, as we moved around Australia to the various areas that we visited, was the amount of conflict which was created over plans for the use of the coast, plans for outfalls into the sea or such other things. The headline, `The killing of our coast', which occurred in local papers in the Geelong region, is an example of the types of emotive expressions which are used at the local level for some of the things carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> The first recommendation of this report calls for:</PARA>
<PARA>Effective public participation in coastal zone management be encouraged at the local government level by a variety of mechanisms, such as: the preparation of local zoning plans in consultation with the community, the development of better environmental mediation procedures and the establishment of local consultative committees on specific projects and issues. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not to say that in some cases, perhaps in a majority of cases, those mechanisms are available, but perhaps it indicates there is a need to emphasise the availability of those mechanisms so as to encourage the wider debate that is required to satisfy the community that in fact when decisions are made about the coast, they are appropriate decisions. I suppose that was at the kernel of much of the conflict that we saw. </PARA>
<PARA> I compare some of the matters that we investigated in this inquiry with some of the things that this Committee was exposed to in the previous Parliament in its land degradation inquiry. Again there was this Commonwealth-State relationship; again there was this lack of coordination between the many agencies in the different spheres of government which have control. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie spoke of our responsibility as stewards of our environment, and that was one of the recurring themes in the land degradation inquiry; land care groups understood that they were there as stewards for their environment and that they needed to look after it appropriately to pass it on to future generations. In the land degradation inquiry it was perhaps a bit clearer how the community could become practically involved through freehold or leasehold tenure, and other such matters. There was a more direct relationship between the environment and habitats which people were asked to be involved in-to either repair or to look after. It is not as clear when we look at the coastal environment because those issues of ownership are perhaps not as distinct. Certainly the same principles of involvement of the community can be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> To do that we really have to look at the information that is available, we have to look at the baseline data which research enables us to have, and I think the more emphasis we can put on that, the more guidance and the more assistance through research grants we can have to the number of agencies doing work in that field, the better things will be. It became a bit frustrating when people saw things like the London Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, which set guidelines about what we pour into the oceans from ships, was not applied to the things we allow to go into oceans through outfalls. I suppose that is something we really should look at, because it is incongruous to have a regulation about those things dumped at sea rather than those things dumped into the sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The coast is the interface between the land and the water environment. It is very important that something which has evolved over many thousands of years should play a role. The pressures which are placed on the coastal environment through human activity are great, whether they be through recreational purposes, tourist purposes, industry or the stresses of large urban cities. They are things we have to take into account. Those pressures will undoubtedly lead to change, change at a greater rate perhaps than the environment is either capable of or should be capable of taking. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the important things that this report highlights. It is an important report which focuses community attitudes on the way in which we treat the coast. I join with those who have spoken before to congratulate the inquiry secretary, David Crawford, on his efforts. He was ably assisted with secretarial support by Tracy Cumberland. The way in which the Committee has been able to put together this report is a reflection of the professional attitude of the secretariat staff. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I quote from the Canberra Times editorial on the report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA>Just as the nations of the world have begun to realise that they must work together to reduce ozone depletion of greenhouse gases, on a national level we must realise that pollution must be addressed with one voice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also am happy to join in commending the report of the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled The injured coastline: Protection of the coastal environment, and in particular to commend its recommendations to the Government. This report has been prepared over the life of two parliaments. It was begun by the previous Committee and concluded by this Committee. The report is some 126 pages but it is thoroughly readable and provides a great deal of information for anyone who is interested in this vital topic. There is a lot of anecdotal information that helps to draw attention to specific problems that illustrate the national perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a much studied area of community interest, and one whole section of the report deals with a review of some of the work done by other committees and other reviews. David Crawford and the staff and all those associated with the preparation of this report have put together a document that will be a textbook on the subject for many years to come. I congratulate the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), and others who worked on it for the way the report has been prepared. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) also requested that she be identified with these words of thanks, particularly to the Committee Chairman, who has a wonderful way of putting witnesses at ease, ensuring that we receive the information we require. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is one of vast space. A great deal of land is shared amongst not a large number of people. Yet in Dorothea Mackellar's land of sweeping plains and rugged mountain ranges, the fact is that most Australians live in the coastal zone. Something like three-quarters of the entire population is gathered along that tiny strip, leaving vast inland areas largely vacant. So the vast number of Australians are directly concerned by the report and its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> People often move to areas they consider to be beautiful and pristine, but the very reason they move there-often to be away from others-has the effect of attracting other people. Conflicts soon develop; those who went there in the hope of serenity and silence find other people joining them, and the issues grow. Those small communities develop into cities with high rise, sewerage and industry, and the issues grow into ones of monumental proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> As this Committee travelled around Australia, visiting what many might consider to be glamorous locations but usually examining sewerage systems and factories and other less glamorous aspects of those societies, it was almost invariably confronted by local action groups which were dealing with this, that or the other local issue. Many of them asked the Committee to intervene and perhaps to make some kind of assessment of their case. That was not our role, of course, but we were very interested in the dynamics of dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that individual environmental disputes are attracting a lot of attention. A small group sometimes is able to focus national attention on an issue that does not enjoy broad community support but nonetheless is able to generate a great deal of heat and a great deal of conflict. Without doubt our society would be better if we were able to put in place mechanisms that enabled these kinds of disputes to be settled in an orderly and peaceful manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looked at that whole question of dispute resolution. I note with interest that in my own electorate the Fitzgerald inquiry currently looking at Fraser Island and environs is also examining this area. The Fitzgerald inquiry is going about it in a much different style. A grand conference was held in the Sheraton in Brisbane which, regrettably, only people with rather large salaries could afford to attend, so it missed something of the point. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry is trying to come to grips not only with the issues on Fraser Island but also with the fundamental question of how we can better resolve disputes. True, there are procedures in place. There are legal arrangements whereby people can appeal and go to the courts, but they are costly, not just for the protest groups but also for the developer. Many worthwhile projects have floundered because even the developer cannot afford to be involved in the disputation processes of the courts. So we certainly need to look at other measures for resolving these kinds of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have moved to the Green political parties building out of the great number of individual disputes all over the place, but those sorts of parties will never resolve the issues. We need to have in place a system that is effectively able to deal with issues within the mainstream of the political process, without the need to set up particular structures. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that some newspaper articles have suggested that the Committee was advocating an environmental levy. That is not the case, and some of those newspapers have subsequently corrected their errant headlines. The fact is that, without any doubt, the environment is such an important issue in the community that some people are even prepared to pay extra taxes. But we should not allow environmental levies to be used to gild what is fundamentally another tax. Caring for the environment is a fundamental task of government and should be considered within the normal budgetary framework. It does not need extra levies. Environmental issues need to be considered on their merits and dealt with on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone has already mentioned that many decisions are made every day that affect the environment and that these small decisions sometimes multiply and have a significant general effect. It also needs to be pointed out, however, that not all development is evil. The title of this report is The injured coastline.  The coast is not dead; it is not ruined beyond redemption. True, heavy population pressure has changed it in many ways, but some of the development has been for the good. The Committee saw development work that seems to have made the environment even more pleasant. But when we put large numbers of people in a small area in a fragile environment, there is naturally going to be some effect, and we need to manage that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent times there has been something of a change in attitude in our society from one where man was master of the environment and had a right to treat it as he chose to one where man should be subject to his environment. I think the real situation should be somewhere between those two. Humans have a perfect right to live in the world, just as animals, birds, frogs and trees have a right to be here. When a tree grows in a particular area it alters that environment. When humans live in an environment they change it as well. We have the power of reason and therefore the power to manage our use of the environment in a way that other species perhaps do not have. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst other species have a right to be here, so do we. So it is essential that, in reviewing the way in which we live on this earth, we care for our environment and manage it in such a way that future generations can also enjoy it. But we do not have to be ashamed of, or apologise for, our presence here. We just need to use the environment wisely and well. I believe that this report will contribute in that regard. I commend it to the Government and urge the Government to review the recommendations seriously, because it has the capacity to improve considerably the way in which this nation not only manages its environment but deals with the various environmental issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The goals which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts set out to achieve were indeed onerous ones. To identify particular areas of the coastline which were under environmental stress, to identify and propose specific measures to be implemented, to raise the profile of environmental degradation in the coastal zone, and to define an appropriate role for the Commonwealth are indeed difficult tasks. Honourable members from Western Australia, of course, in compiling reports such as this, suffer also from the tyranny of distance because it is difficult to travel the great distances that are required to attend all of the hearings of such a committee. Indeed, for the one part of the trip that I really wanted to go on, to Broome in my own State, I found myself in Sydney with the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the banking inquiry, while other members of the Committee were in Broome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I would like to do in my brief period to speak is just to focus on some of the issues that are peculiarly Western Australian. During November last year, we had the opportunity to spend a day travelling down the coast of Western Australia and we saw the full spectrum of the difficulties which exist there. We started off, of course, at Scarborough Beach. If one stands on the beach in Western Australia, one can look as far as one wants north or south and see beautiful white sands and lovely blue water. Unfortunately, the one thing that obscures one's vision is that monolith at Scarborough, Observation City, a testament to the work of the forces of evil, if I might say so. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who is sitting here in front of me, throughout the machinations that surrounded the building of that monument was one who, to his great credit, opposed the proposal most vehemently. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem with residential beach development and the usage of beaches. Indeed, along that stretch of coastline in Western Australia, the housing developments are considerably removed from the local beach areas. In Los Angeles and in Sydney and in other cities of the world one does not see the separation of the coast and the usages of the coast by individuals from the residential settlement. Indeed, we have made some good decisions in that respect. In the older areas, of course, like Cottesloe, housing is to be found right up to the beach area and there are problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We went further south to Cockburn Sound. The difficulties that exist in Cockburn Sound relate, of course, to industrial pollution. In that area are located iron and steel works, an oil refinery, an aluminium refinery, cement works, chemical plants, meat and fish processing plants, power stations, and facilities for ship maintenance, fishing and tourism. The result has been considerable pollution of Cockburn Sound, which is, of course, a matter of great concern for people in the area. Indeed, there has been a massive loss of the sea grass meadows in Cockburn Sound and it will take many years to turn around the environmental consequences of this pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> We moved further down to Warnbro Sound and we saw the difficulty mentioned by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who spoke before me about public participation and the need for the public to be involved in the processes locally. The local action group told us of their interest in the development of the area of Warnbro Sound and, indeed, in recommendation No. 1 we pick up the possibility for increasing public participation. Local zone plans need to be developed; there is a need for environmental mediation procedures to be developed and, indeed, for local consultation with local committees. In fact, in recommendation No. 1 we pursue that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We then moved further south to Mandurah. We saw the effect on the area of the movement of nutrients from the rural hinterland into Mandurah estuary. The proposal is for the establishment of the Dawesville Cut, an area which will allow the estuary to breathe and to be washed out into the sea. But with every proposal that we saw along the coastline, what needs to be remembered is that, whatever we do to interfere, there are effects and countereffects. So it will be necessary for us to watch very closely what occurs in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that we are very limited in time. Let me finally say that I have great admiration for the Committee, for David Crawford, who is here with us, and Lindy Smith and the staff and, indeed, the Chairman, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), who put so much work into this Committee. I hope that we will minimise the problems for the future and that we will have some long term outcomes and balanced solutions in the future as a result of this report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure today to be supporting and talking with respect to the tabling of this report of the delegation to Romania, Greece and London because it was probably one of the most enjoyable trips certainly that I have been on and because the theme which ran throughout the visit was the overall importance of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation visited Romania, which is itself a fledging democracy; we visited Greece, which of course is the cradle of democracy; and whilst we were in London the opening ceremony of the thirtieth annual session of the North Atlantic Assembly was conducted in Westminster Hall, which is the cradle of parliamentary democracy. So the theme of democracy was uppermost in our minds during the visit. </PARA>
<PARA> The first place that the delegation visited was Romania, and ours was the first visit by a parliamentary delegation since democratic elections were held in that country in May 1990. The visit was characterised by outstanding warmth and hospitality, and we were able to have wide ranging discussions at senior levels-very senior levels, in fact-and we conducted several inspections both in Bucharest and Brasov, which is in Transylvania. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions highlighted the commitment of Romanians to the democratisation process and to the move to a market economy. There was real concern, however, wherever we went at their lack of experience in operating a democratic political system-for example, a major problem in understanding the legitimate role of opposition parties to criticise. We found wherever we went that the National Salvation Front found it very difficult to comprehend that oppositions were able to criticise-that that was their job. They are also concerned, of course, at their inexperience in administering a market economy.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a number of problems in Romania since the May elections, and the most serious was the miners strike and associated violence in mid-June. Since that time, the situation in Romania appears to have improved, and it seems also that the democratisation that has occurred is going to continue. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is one of the recommendations of the delegation that the Romanians should be encouraged to further improve this democratisation by both direct and indirect assistance. We recommended to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) that Australia, in its capacity as a group of 24 nations, join in agreeing to giving assistance to Romania. Of course, not all that long after the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated to us in writing-and it is part of the report-that, indeed, Australia would do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit highlighted the terrible plight of the Romanian people and the dreadful legacy of the Ceausescu years. The country is characterised by poverty. There are queues for even basic items like bread and meat and a lack of variety of nutritional foods. The darkness, the starkness, the greyness, the industrial pollution, the buildings marked with bullet holes and the memorials to the martyrs of the revolution were all things that stick out in our minds when we think about that trip. People frequently asked us, `Do you know what we have gone through?'-and they really are shell-shocked. </PARA>
<PARA> Possibly the most graphic illustration of the former dictator's legacy was evident in the orphanages we visited. A lot has been said about the orphanages in Romania, and I do not want to dwell on that. I want to read one section of the report of the delegation which says it all in terms of some of the orphanages over there. Paragraph 2.4.15 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, the Leader, Deputy Leader and Secretary of the Delegation were invited to inspect the orphanage at Timis de Sus, housing approximately fifty children whose ages ranged from 18 years to infancy. Children with severe mental and physical disabilities were mixed in with normal children of all ages and both sexes. The difficulty of finding adequate accommodation became clear during this inspection-though generally clean, the sleeping areas were very crowded-up to 15 per room-and sanitation and ventilation provisions were most inadequate, with sewerage buckets kept behind the door. However, the children were warm and adequately fed, despite the fact, as the nurses stressed, that it was difficult to provide a variety of nutritious foods, a problem common for most Romanians. Most remarkably, the children were responsive to the nurses, an enormous contrast to what had amounted to apathy on the part of the children when the nurses had first arrived. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that I speak on behalf of the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), and the secretary to the delegation, Anne Hazelton, when I say that the stench is something we will never forgot. It is something which will remain in our nostrils. One of the other things that we will always remember is the heart-wrenching thought when the kids were coming up to us and grabbing our legs and more or less indicating that they did not want to us to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, there is nevertheless a sense of optimism and hope for the future in Romania. The delegation's recommendations regarding Romania are aimed at encouraging the process of democratisation and in further developing trade opportunities. I want to stress that the warmth of our reception in Romania and the friendliness of the people are long lasting memories for the delegation. I am very pleased to say that, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), an Australian Romanian Parliamentary Friendship Group has been set up. We hope to meet with the Consul-General of the Romanian Republic in Australia, Pavel Platona, in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The next country we visited was Greece. Our visit to Greece served to emphasise the very strong ties between our two countries. During discussions, Greek officials frequently mentioned the contribution of Australians during World War II. Our ties were bolstered by very significant contributions to our political, cultural and economic life made by the Greek community in Australia. Enormous debt is owed by Western civilisation to the philosophy of ancient Greece. The delegation was privileged during the visit to inspect many achievements of the ancient past. </PARA>
<PARA> During the visit both sides expressed regret that trade and commerce relationships between Australia and Greece are very small, and we would hope that that can improve. We held many interesting meetings in Greece. For example, the delegation appreciated the knowledge and insights of former Prime Minister Papandreou, who last November-remember, last November-in discussions on the Middle East crisis and its aftermath, foreshadowed a heightening of the Kurdish problem and destruction of the Kuwait oilfields with long lead times necessary to repair the damage. That, of course, was before a shot was even fired. Overall, the visit was one of outstanding warmth, hospitality and friendship. It was really something that we will never forget. </PARA>
<PARA> We also visited London. A major reason we visited London was to talk with the Anzac Parliamentary Group. Unfortunately, something happened that day-namely, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided that she would resign. She announced her resignation on that day and the delegation was in attendance during Mrs Thatcher's last address as Prime Minister to the House of Commons. </PARA>
<PARA> Our principal task in London was to attend the thirty-sixth annual session of the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA). This was a significant step forward for Australia on this occasion as we were accorded associate delegation status, entitling Australia to a seat at committee tables, and the right to speak in committee debates and in the plenary session. The delegation saw this as a valuable opportunity to put forward Australia's viewpoint on a range of issues. The key concern of the delegation was the future of the Uruguay Round of talks, which at that stage had not stalled. The delegation focused on the significance of agriculture to the Round and the need for movement in the areas of export subsidies and market access. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues raised by the delegation were the Gulf crisis and developments in eastern Europe. The delegation has made recommendations to ensure that, in future, steps will be taken to the effect that Australia's delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly will be well placed to present Australia's views on a broad range of issues. Attendance at future NAA meetings for Australian parliamentary delegations is indeed an exciting and challenging prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> Before my time expires, I want to thank a number of people. Firstly, I want to thank the staff who have helped to put the report together, particularly Pat Sherman, who did the word processing, and also Andy Hall and Terry Lyons, who did the printing. If I had 10 minutes more I would tell honourable members how members of this delegation got on tremendously well. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know how important that is. Everybody got on. Bipartisanship was everywhere. They were a delight to be with as far as I and my wife, Tina, were concerned. I want to thank my wife, Tina, who helped me get through a lot of after dinner speeches. It would have been very difficult for me if she had not been there. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to thank the honourable member for Bradfield and his wife, Monique, and the mascot, young Ellis, who I think will probably join the Labor Party after the brainwashing I gave him. I want to thank Senator Austin Lewis and Mrs Willie Lewis, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and his wife, Cathy, the honourable member for Port Adelaide and his wife, Aldona, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) and his wife, Julie, and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck). </PARA>
<PARA> I want to thank in particular Anne Hazelton, the secretary to the delegation. She was just marvellous. She was always available. She was the packhorse for all our gear. I am sure everyone on the delegation would say that she was just simply wonderful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) in noting, for the benefit of the House, the great success, the harmonious activities and the undoubted enjoyment we all shared as members of the delegation, which worked extremely well together. It can best be described as a textbook delegation, in contrast possibly to what happened in Africa last year, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did our best, with considerable success, in maintaining the important tradition of this Parliament. Regardless of political differences at home, when we are abroad we always speak as Australians. Our leader held up the flag extremely well, as did his wife, Tina. Anne Hazelton has already been referred to. I join with the Parliamentary Secretary in confirming that Anne was an outstanding secretary to the delegation. We could not have asked for better support. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the delegation was successful because the group was able to mesh so well together. In a parliamentary sense, one often wonders precisely what is successful, but one thing is quite clear-Australian parliamentary delegations have the potential to make a very significant contribution to Australia's overall diplomatic activities and the extension of our national interests abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw to the attention of the House the fact that there are 11 official delegations each year. Some 50 senators and members leave these shores and visit probably every continent in the world. I have always felt that the parliamentary contribution to Australia's diplomatic effort is significantly underplayed, because there is a perception in the bureaucracy that overseas visits are simply junkets, a way of keeping members of parliament, preferably backbenchers, happy. If people examine the veracity of that assertion against the facts they will find that it is an absurd proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia today has its back to the wall. We are not just talking about `free markets'; we are talking about a free market for ideas. We are talking about the very existence of this country. Perhaps I could draw on none other than Thucydides, the famous Greek historian of the fourth and fifth century BC. Even then he identified this problem. He said that `in the affairs of states the strong will demand what they will and the weak must yield what they must'. When we travel overseas we often go to countries which are weaker than us. We also visit many other countries which are stronger than us. The one thing which is common to both is the almost total lack of knowledge of this country, what it stands for, its political beliefs, its principles, its values, its economic potential and what its role should be in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this goes very much to the core of much of our problem. The world is now influenced so much by change. Yet our incapacity to develop and distribute those ideas and to influence events is contributing to us losing the battle. Our problems with Malaysia at this very moment are merely symptomatic of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation visited Romania-a country which, in human value terms, has little. The capacity of its people was almost destroyed by the Ceausescu Government-by 48 years of deprivation, intellectual regimentation and almost complete destruction of the value systems of that nation. Yet we saw the spark of democracy being relit-a passion of a people to rebuild despite the problems of the past. They wondered why their great ally, that great supporter of democracy, the United States-fortunately, the policy has changed since we were there-was standing back and saying, `You are different from the rest of eastern Europe. We are not satisfied with your progress towards democracy'. Perhaps the Americans and the European Economic Community (EEC) not realise the danger of that approach and the damage it was doing to a relatively few people who had the courage to take up the challenge and were trying desperately to apply democratic principles through their legal and institutional framework. </PARA>
<PARA> As we were the first western European delegation to visit Romania since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime, we were able to hold out the hand of friendship and demonstrate to Romanians that the democratic ideal was worth trying to achieve, despite the problems; that there is a role, as the leader of the delegation said, for oppositions; that just because a government is elected by a majority it does not mean that its word is law indefinitely or in every field; that every idea has a counter view; that progress can always be improved. The objective of Romania and all those countries of eastern Europe must be to combine the intellectual capacity and vigour of their people in their parliamentary system to achieve common goals-the freedom and the integrity of their people. </PARA>
<PARA> When we went on to Greece we discovered a new disease called visual deprivation. May I explain it briefly. In six days in Romania we did not see one neon sign. We did not see one shop with a decent display in a window. All we saw were empty shelves and queues of people. We did not realise the psychological impact of that until we landed in Greece and travelled into Athens from the airport. We saw before us Volvo and Mercedes signs, bright street lights, neon signs, well-dressed people and cars all over the place. If anybody believes that the socialist system as applied in eastern Europe for decades has given anything to its people they should simply spend a week in Romania and then go to Vienna, Rome or Athens and see for themselves the stark contrast of the lifestyles of the people. Nobody could leave that environment and not support the democratic process, with all its faults. As Churchill said, it may not be the best, but no-one has come up with a better ideal yet. </PARA>
<PARA> I make just two brief observations. The Anzac group will present us with a challenge in the future because I believe the links with the United Kingdom are being reduced. We need to consider in detail the importance of the United Kingdom in the context of the European Economic Community, because Britain offers a springboard for Australian economic penetration of western and eastern Europe that must never be ignored for what it can give Australian businessmen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> My final observation is about the North Atlantic Assembly. It is an important institution. This was the first time we had had a delegation led by a member of the government executive and we recommend in our report that that be continued. In many respects, the Asia Pacific seminar was not a success because we were dealing with Europeans, who have no real conception of the Asia Pacific region-and few seem to want to know. Sadly, I have to say that the Americans were the worst because they did not even attend the seminar. Nevertheless, this is a challenge and is one that we must take very seriously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommended at that forum that the Australian Government and this Parliament start considering seriously the implications of establishing in our own region an Asia Pacific parliamentary assembly. We must be able in our own environment to create a political mechanism, in addition to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which is essentially a governmental and economic mechanism, to give parliamentarians throughout this region and the Pacific world the opportunity to come together on a regular basis to discuss and compare each other's systems and to better understand problems. Malaysia is a classic example of the very real difficulties and the clashes which can take place between an Eastern philosophical tradition and Western ideals. </PARA>
<PARA> There are fundamental differences. They are important differences to both cultures. The only way they can be overcome is through a process of education and information. We cannot stand back from Asia. We cannot stand back from the development of the Pacific. It is going to be the economic centre of the world into the twenty-first century. Australia has an important role to play. If we miss this chance and do not take it up now, we will be passed over by Japan, by China and by developing members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. The opportunities which this country should have for its children will be missed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My purpose in presenting the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill to the House is very straightforward. I would regard this as historic legislation. Under section 51(xv.) of the Constitution, it is clear that the Federal Parliament has the responsibility for setting time zones in Australia. Many honourable members would be aware that in Australia currently this responsibility is held by State governments. So far that has presented no major difficulties except when we move to summer time. Painting an analogy, summer time in Australia is somewhat like our rail system-that is, through the stubborn refusal of some people at the State level we do not have a uniform system of summer time. This has presented enormous problems in terms of managing the economy and conducting business, let alone the general direction of Australia as a community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that, for example, in Europe there are two time zones. Western and continental Europe span two time zones, but they choose to operate on a single time zone-one hour ahead of universal time. This zone covers all members of the European Community, except the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Turkey; all members of the European Free Trade Association, with the exception of Finland; as well as Yugoslavia, Albania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. In other words, if one goes from Warsaw in Poland all the way to the English Channel, one has one time zone. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Perth says, it is very sensible. In Australia, because of what I would call narrow-mindedness at the State level, we have had a reluctance, particularly in Western Australia, for people to recognise that in summer time there is a benefit in our retaining a parity of two hours time difference between Western Australia and the rest of Australia. The Liberal and National Party dominated upper House of Western Australia has refused to recognise that it is part of the real world. It still belongs to the fading curtains brigade-those who believe that somehow if daylight saving were introduced their curtains would fade. Someone actually telephoned me and said, `My grass has been drier this summer, and if you bring daylight saving in it will get worse'. That is the quality of the argument put forward. It is not unusual in this place to deal with a similar quality of argument from the other side, but I did not expect it on this issue. However, that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Western Australia we are severely deprived in terms of adopting summer time like the rest of Australia, with the exception of the Northern Territory. I exclude the Northern Territory for geographic reasons. But in Western Australia there is no excuse. There are three major reasons for my argument: a significant reduction in energy usage; improved recreational opportunities; and significant reductions in business costs. Bringing together our time zones represents a major step towards micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say to those who will get excited about States rights that this legislation provides for the Commonwealth to consult with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory or the Premier of each State to get his or her advice on the matter. If, as has happened in Western Australia, we had summer time being blocked by the upper House, the Premier in fact could advise the Commonwealth and summer time could be introduced at the national level. But it is important, in my view, that we recognise what has happened in many parts of the world; that micro-economic reform requires the introduction of measures that reduce costs and improve the recreational opportunities for people. I set that out very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly indebted to John Birch and Professor Goldsmid of the National Standards Commission for their work. I thank them for the advice they have given me in preparing this Bill. It is my view that, if we do move to introduce this Bill and have it passed in the Federal Parliament, and if we have a say in the setting of time zones, their expertise and that of a body such as the National Standards Commission will be very helpful to have on hand for this sort of exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, it is important to emphasise that in Australia previously we have used daylight saving. We used it for wartime emergencies. In Tasmania it was introduced when there was a particularly severe drought; to reduce demand upon energy sources. At a time when we are trying to improve our energy efficiency, to reduce business costs and to improve recreational opportunities, it is important that we have a much better national approach to time zones, and that we give areas of Australia such as Western Australia, which has been deprived of daylight saving, the opportunity to move into the twentieth century with the rest of Australia and share the opportunity to have a common time zone measurement. Accordingly, I am pleased to commend this Bill to the House. I hope that colleagues in other parties see fit to support it. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) notes the major contribution to enhancing local facilities made by the Commonwealth Government's Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities program through provision of financial assistance to sporting and recreational organisations;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) notes that the purpose of this program is too encourage the development of high quality sport and recreational facilities across Australia to enable greater community participation in sport and improved development of skills to enhance Australia's national and international sporting performances, as recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reports of May and December 1989 entitled ``Going for Gold'' and ``Can Sport be Bought'', respectively;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) seeks a continuation of this program in the 1991-92 Commonwealth Budget to enable additional support to be provided throughout Australia for development of further community facilities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) calls upon the Government to allocate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a sum of not less than $20 million over a three year period for the Recreation and Sporting Facilities program; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a similar sum for the establishment of a National Sports Facilities program to provide substantial financial support for the construction of sporting facilities of national significance, particularly in regional centres, in accordance with recommendations contained in the above-mentioned reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of this motion to the House is appropriate at this time, as the Government is commencing the process of framing the 1991-92 Budget. I hope that we can look forward to the support of honourable members on both sides of the House on this motion, as there are no partisan political objectives behind it. In moving the motion, I should reflect on the contribution that has been made in the past by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in pursuing this issue. I appreciate his support for the motion today, although he is not in the House at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur was the chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration when the two reports mentioned in the motion, Going for Gold and Can Sport be Bought?, were produced and tabled. He has been a persistent and articulate advocate for all people in our community who participate in sport and recreational activities, particularly those people who strive to provide excellent sporting facilities for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 12 months since my election I have had the pleasure to meet hundreds of people involved in community sporting clubs in the electorate of Moreton. They have been either keen players or participants in local weekend sporting activities or parents and supporters who work hard behind the scenes to enable the events to occur. I have visited a number of clubhouses, playing fields and swimming pools to present trophies, congratulate winners and commend the efforts of all involved in the presentation of their sport. They are involved in a multitude of sports: cricket, rugby league, rugby union, touch football, swimming, croquet, lawn bowls, tennis, softball, athletics, netball, hockey, soccer, badminton-the list goes on. Their clubhouses and grounds vary greatly in size, range of facilities and standard of equipment. But there is one common thread: their spirit of determination to strive to excel; their spirit of competition; and their desire to provide the children of our community with opportunities to play and to develop skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of children and adults every weekend are out enjoying healthy exercise, developing and honing skills and making friendships which will last throughout their lives. Almost all of these clubs and groups operate on shoestring budgets. The parents or members run raffles, dances, barbecues and other fundraising activities to buy the equipment, maintain their grounds and, if they can, build a clubhouse for training and meetings. Millions of dollars is raised every year by local community sporting and recreational clubs to enable people-young and old-to participate in a healthy way of life. They do an enormous amount for our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to be able to speak in this Parliament on behalf of all of those groups in my electorate, and those all over Australia, to express their hope for a continuation of the valuable assistance provided by the Commonwealth's community recreation and sporting facilities program. This program was introduced in the 1988-89 Federal Budget with a $13m allocation to be spent over three years. It was a popular initiative, and over 1,000 applications for assistance were received. Unfortunately, only about 200 of them were able to be granted assistance, and the $13m was soon spent. The number of applications compared with the funds available demonstrates the need for this program to be further funded in the next Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I know of at least two submissions from my electorate which will be forwarded if further funds are provided. I am sure that there will be many others made by many of the clubs in my electorate. The first one that I would like to touch on comes from the Brisbane Metropolitan Touch Association, which has its headquarters at Whites Hill in my electorate. It was a recipient in the previous program, receiving $15,333 in 1988-89 for the provision of lighting at its grounds. The total cost of the project was $60,515, so it is obvious that the Association members made a major fundraising effort to complete the project themselves. They are now wishing to construct a clubhouse, at a cost of some $200,000, to establish a Brisbane headquarters for touch football at Whites Hill. This clubhouse will serve over 5,000 touch football players who compete every week in the Brisbane area. It is a very worthwhile project, deserving of support. </PARA>
<PARA> The other submission is in considerable contrast to the touch football association's. I am patron of the Stephens Croquet Club, a small but vibrant group who owns its grounds and building at Annerley. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a game played by young and old, and it is enjoyed by many thousands of people around Australia. That club has been for many years, and is now, a well respected and very competitive contributor to State and national croquet competitions. One of the members of the Stephens Croquet Club represented Australia at an international competition held in London last year, and played very well. Its submission relates to its clubhouse, which is now quite old and is requiring renovation and upgrading. It also will be seeking our support through the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those are just two examples of many hundreds around Australia in all honourable members' electorates. Worthwhile men and women, boys and girls, working hard, enjoying their sport and the friendships and personal development associated with it are seeking our support. These are the people whom the community recreation and sporting facilities program was established to support. In the first round, financial assistance offered was snapped up very quickly. The initiative of the Hawke Labor Government in funding this program demonstrates our clear commitment to the community-to families and to children. We need that commitment to continue. Clearly an increased allocation is required to meet the needs of these groups. They are providing very productive, beneficial and efficient means of recreation, physical exercise, personal development and community infrastructure which costs the Government actually very little. Each dollar invested by the Government in this program is repaid many times over in terms of improved health, less crime and better educated and positively developed citizens leading productive and worthwhile lives. </PARA>
<PARA> This is clearly a program of national significance. One has only to review the list of recipients of assistance from the last program to understand this. It is quite an extensive list: from Aurukun in far north Queensland down to Hobart; from the Boree Creek Lawn Courts Committee to the Wickepan Football Club in Western Australia; and from the Whyalla Workers Bowling Club to the Northern Territory Police and Citizens Youth Club. They have invested the contribution from the Federal Government wisely and well in the people of our nation. Funds from this program went all across the nation and in most Federal members' electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not addressed the second program suggested in the motion, the national sports facilities program. I understand that the honourable member for Macarthur will speak on this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude on this note. In good times and bad, whether things are looking gloomy or bright, our community will always need and rely on our local clubs to develop our young people into keen, fit, worthwhile Australians. These programs deserve the support of Government and of all honourable members in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To a certain extent, I personally endorse the terms of this motion. The objectives seem good, though I intend to put some alternatives to the methods proposed by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). I think that somewhere in there we can achieve a result. There is no doubt that, since the instigation of the program, the National Party of Australia and Liberal Party of Australia have recognised that physical fitness really does have a bearing on the general health levels of the community. We are acutely aware that improvement in the overall level of community fitness does impact on the cost of health care and the increase in productivity in the workplace. Benefits of a very important kind in a general sense are accrued to the community if we have a fit, capable and sport conscious community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program that the Government has instigated hands out something like $13m a year to a wide range of groups. These groups sought $100m worth of grants last year and the Government was able to find only $13m to assist in this community area. That indicates that there is a strong demand, a strong wish, for improvements and facilities that this Government-and I believe any government-could not possibly meet. The modest proposal of $20m over a three-year period is an increment, bringing the total roughly up to $20m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the attention of the House to some of the problems of this program. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Moreton, spoke of the Brisbane Metropolitan Touch Association. He indicated that, despite a need for $60,000, only $15,000 was able to be supplied by the Commonwealth Government-and it was one of the fortunate grant recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> Running through the list, the City of Heidelberg, for instance, received $100,000 towards an indoor recreation centre. It would not have been even a drop in the bucket. In those circumstances $100,000 would not even be acknowledged at the opening ceremony by the local authorities. It does not contribute to any major degree to the project. The Shire of Hastings received $100,000 for an indoor swimming pool. </PARA>
<PARA> I am choosing these at random, but we can run through almost every one of the grants and say that a minuscule amount has been contributed to an existing program by the Commonwealth Government. In that regard, while the program is good in intent, I do not know that it is really achieving its objectives. First of all, it falls short, massively, of the total amount of funds being sought. Secondly, where funds are supplied for projects, they touch only a minuscule part of the total cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see the Parliament and our community look at other alternatives. The alternatives that I believe are available to us include tax deductibility for donations to sporting bodies. I would agree to the scrapping of this program tomorrow if tax deductibility could be gained. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, just to use one project in my own area, I know of a large netball complex that will cost $1.5m. My electorate has a large population. Netball is a massive sport, the third most frequently played sport in Australia. The facility demand is intense. There is no way a group of netball enthusiasts and their local council can raise the $1.5m needed for a complex like that unless they can gain significant support. I believe that that support should come down to them through the national body of netball, the national body receiving the tax deductibility so that donations to it can be passed down to the local level for groups raising funds for a facility. </PARA>
<PARA> I put an alternative proposition. I do not believe it is the time for the taxpayer to continue to fork out funds in this way-a little seeding grant here and there. Whilst the objective is good, to extend the burden on our Budget by any method is really not in the best interests of the Australian community. Australia is in a dreadful situation today. How can we afford to keep paying out on everything, no matter how worthy the cause may be? How can we afford to keep paying out on everything?</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget was going to have a massive surplus. It will be a lineball surplus or a deficit. That will impact on next year. There is pain and job loss and all sorts of things happening in our community. The old catch cry of the Australian Labor Party was `What about the workers?'. What about the workers? The Labor Government is not attending to those issues, but the honourable member, worthily, wants to give out more money for the cause of community recreation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that we look at alternatives such as tax deductibility and the encouragement of sponsorship. Being involved in a parliamentary inquiry, I understand that sometimes there is difficulty in achieving a rapport between a sport and a potential sponsor so that there is a continuity of money and goods or services supplied by the sponsor to a sporting group. </PARA>
<PARA> But an educative process is needed for sports which find their presentation is not attractive to the public. Some sports do not lend themselves very readily to much public participation or public viewing, particularly on television. One has only to look at the massive changes that have been made in the presentation of sports such as netball, as I referred to earlier. The sharpening up of the rules, the continuity of the action, the types and quality of uniforms and the presentation of the participants all add to viewers' perception of and willingness to support a particular sport. </PARA>
<PARA> This applies to many sports. A lot of effort has been put in to sharpen up the public perception of women's tennis. Show jumping is another sport which is often seen on television. I would not classify snooker as a sport but, in programs such as Pot Black, snooker-and lawn bowls-can be presented compellingly so that people can view the sport on the field at the place of playing or on television. I believe that, with the coming of cable and pay television, minor sports will take pre-eminence for people who are interested in sports. They will be able to tune in and watch a television channel that will play all sorts of sport continually. Therefore, people will see croquet on television when there is pay or cable television. That then will start to draw a sponsorship reaction. There can be advertising in the background and, in the competitive process, teams will attract a lot of attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Sponsorship needs work from government. I would rather see effort being put into developing a cohesive approach to sponsorship. I would like to see more effort put into developing avenues through which sponsors feel they can be recognised. It should be explained to our amateur sports that they are not losing their status or their role in our society. Amateur sports men and women see themselves as having an ethical role when they accept sponsorship. I have seen a big movement of sponsorship into many sports, but not until there are full time professional players does the sport really change. Up to that point it is very healthy to see the community-those with funds and a wish to advertise what they do-joining with those who participate in sport to present effectively our sports men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Opposition's view that we should be seeking a wider participation in sport. The elite sports program of seven sports only fascinates me. New South Wales has 11 elite sports. There are different approaches throughout Australia. The New South Wales Government is doing a magnificent job. The honourable member has already mentioned much of the work. I would prefer to see sports being developed regionally. Last year in New South Wales $5m was provided to the regional sports facility assistance program. That will have quite an impact. The elite sports groups run in the States, talented youngsters groups-all of these programs are excellent. We in this Parliament should seek a wider involvement in sport, and from that core of participants we will build the elite of the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not a lot of disagreement between members of this Parliament on the need for funding of sport. That flows right through from Commonwealth and State to local governments. In the short time available my plea is that this Government take into consideration the recommendations in the reports of two inquiries of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that I chaired. The first report is entitled Going for Gold and the second Can Sport be Bought?. These reports touch on all the issues that are being debated here. They go to the questions of how much should be allocated; the size of the grants; who should be involved at what level-that is, elite athletes and broad participation; whether the State or Commonwealth government is responsible for facilities; and the question of tax deductions. All of those matters are contained in these documents and, in my view, the recommendations contained in them are worthy of consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we are debating two parts of the program that the various Ministers responsible for sport have been able to put into place since this Government came into office. The first has been covered by my colleague from Queensland, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), and that is the community sport and recreation facilities grants program. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was absolutely right in saying that the amounts of money were not enough to complete the projects he referred to. Notwithstanding that, in many cases the funding was enough to complete small projects such as a croquet field in Queensland or to provide some light so that the National Soccer League team of Wollongong City could participate during the recent summer competition at Brandon Park in my electorate. They were appropriate amounts and they fully achieved what was required. In other areas they supplemented funds which the sport itself had been able to find or which local government had been prepared to put in. In some cases, I agree, it was a drop in the ocean. In other cases, the money went towards providing the necessary back-up so that the facility could be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned-as are you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because of your concern for sport and your support for areas such as the Croome Road sporting complex in your electorate-about the need for some form of national and regional sports facilities program to be developed. In our area, for example, the Steelers play in the national rugby league, the Wolves and Wollongong Macedonia in the National Soccer League, and the Hawks in the National Basketball League. But it is only the Wolves and Macedonia, who share Brandon Park, which was built with grants that came from the Federal and former State Labor governments and Wollongong City Council, who have a first class facility to play on. It is in need of further work, and the trust that has been established to look after it is working on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Wollongong showground, where the Steelers play, has been improved, but in the main because of private sponsorship from benefactors of the Steelers who have been prepared to do the work. That is appropriate. The community and local government are brought in. In relation to the need for the provision of grandstand facilities, the honourable member for Mitchell referred to the New South Wales Government. I applaud it for making a grant of $2m to Wollongong showground to improve spectator facilities and grandstands for the patrons. The Commonwealth Government, with a national facilities program, should be in a position to complement that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawks, who are in the National Basketball League, play in a stadium known as the Snake Pit, for the obvious reason that it is the pits. It is a terrible facility and they recognise that. They are looking at ways of harnessing private enterprise and government to build a new facility. But the Commonwealth needs to be involved. In that regard, I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to read recommendation No. 24 in Going for Gold. I also refer to the issue of funding in the second report Can Sport be Bought? It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that we will conduct another review as to whether these sorts of grants are necessary. They are, and all-party committees unanimously recommended it. The two reports are here. They have been adopted by the Parliament and they need enacting. </PARA>
<PARA> I plead with the Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), when considering the Budget this year, to look at the provision of funds for national sports facilities in regional areas, which seem to miss out because the funds always go to capital cities, and at the community sport and recreation facilities program, so that small battling organisations can get some money to contribute towards the construction of those facilities. Everyone's electorate benefits from that. Equally, there is a need for greater tax deductibility, and I applaud what the honourable member for Mitchell said about that. There are recommendations along those lines in the reports. It all needs examination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) spoke very strongly and obviously believes very deeply in this subject. However, there are many good causes. Every day in my electorate office many good causes are brought to me. People say, `We need money for this project'. The Edwardstown Bowling Club said, `We desperately need loos for the women. We've got great loos for the men, but the women are really hard up'. I felt very strongly for them, but it does not happen only with the Edwardstown Bowling Club. All over Australia there is a need for more sporting facilities. We cannot afford to fund everything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred to Australia as a banana republic. I do not know whether this was a self-fulfilling prophecy, but that is the way we are going. We will have to look at issues such as this and say, `This is an extremely worthwhile cause but at the moment we can't afford it'. We cannot afford everything. </PARA>
<PARA> Regional areas should be a State responsibility. It is the States that know what is needed. How can we, in the Commonwealth, determine that what is needed in southern South Australia is a lacrosse ground? This might be the breeding place for the greatest lacrosse team ever, but we in the Commonwealth do not know this; States and local government will know this. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility of the Commonwealth Government is in international competition. That is where we should be putting our energies. Australia shows off at the Commonwealth level in competitions such as the Olympic Games. We always give excuses for our performances in the Olympic Games. We are either up there saying `Hey, we're doing really well' or `Gee, it's bad that we didn't do so well because we're a small population'. We could do a lot better in that area. My husband keeps pointing out to me that Australia, with a population of 16 million, won a total of 14 medals during the last Games whereas Hungary, his native country, has a population of 10 million, 50 per cent less than ours, and won a total of 23 medals-almost twice what we won. We should be concentrating on this area. This is a Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to regional grants, I had a look through the regional grants and it seems to me that there is great ability here for a government in power to do a nice lot of pork-barrelling. I am not suggesting that this Government would, indeed, stoop so low as to pork-barrel in marginal electorates; I would never do that. But the fact that this is a possibility I think should be considered by honourable members. So perhaps we could leave the pork-barrelling to the States and to their conscience. I cannot see on what grounds we would decide to give Tooraweenah and District Tennis Club a tennis court resurfacing, the Glen Alice Community Association amenities, and Cowra Skateboard Club skateboard facilities and miss out on all the neighbouring towns which, I am sure, have an equal need. </PARA>
<PARA> I have listened to the speeches of honourable members as much as I could. And there was no mention of the need for the Commonwealth to look at the problem we are now facing; that is, the lack of interest in women's sport. I will give honourable members a few facts on that. In the 1988 Summer Olympics there were 151 men's events, but only 78 women's events. In the Winter Olympics there were 31 men's events and 16 women's events. In the programs of the Australian Institute of Sport, 66 per cent of the people there are men and 34 per cent are women. On newspaper coverage, only 2.5 per cent of total sports reporting space is devoted to women's sport. Photographs of men's sport outnumber those of women's sport roughly 12 : 1. At the Olympic Games there were 169 events for men and 76 events for women. This is what we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked honourable members who spoke previously to have mentioned that there is a need for the Commonwealth to look at sport and to be supporting sport-though that support should not go where the States should be acting-and to look Commonwealth-wide at what is happening to women's sport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues raised in this motion. I wish to say something about the national perspective. Indeed, I support the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) when she says that our primary role must be the development of elite sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must mention the contribution by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He suggested that tax deductibility was a superior route because it represented less cost to the Government. I say to him that that is revenue forgone. Tax deductibility represents public revenue forgone. Whether we contribute grants or provide tax deductibility, it is still loss of revenue whichever way we look at it, so the net effect is the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal matter I want to focus on today is the national and international perspective. For too long in this country it has been accepted that the Australian Institute of Sport, which conceptually is something that I support, needs to be the engine that drives that. Increasingly it is the case that the States have the wherewithal, the States are making the contribution locally and the States are where people are living. It is necessary for us through the Australian Sports Commission to contribute to the programs in the States where athletes are being developed and want to live. The fortress that exists in Canberra is no longer an appropriate source for significant public funding for elite sport. There can be programs in Canberra, but we need to make contributions where the athletes are-in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I want to look at what has happened in Western Australia. An article in the West Australian yesterday is headed, `WA Emerges as an Athletics Power'. For the first time since Western Australia has been holding national championships in a number of age groups, it has finished in a commendable position-third behind New South Wales and Victoria, which have significantly larger populations. This represents the start of programs in Western Australia which are beginning to produce results. We are producing talented athletes in Western Australia because of a significant program instituted by the Western Australian Institute of Sport and supported by the Sports Commission, but not to the extent that it should be at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> What we can see happening in Western Australia is that program coming to fruition. Let us look at gymnastics, and at women's gymnastics in particular: there is a contribution from the Australian Sports Commission of $25,000 to the program in Western Australia. The contribution from the Western Australian Government is $100,000. From the fundraising and fees that parents and friends pay, there is $50,000. Over the last few years that program in Western Australia has consistently produced 25 to 50 per cent of the national team in that sport, yet the contribution that is being made from Canberra to that program in Western Australia is insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at swimming, we see that the same situation is occurring. The Australian Institute of Sport, which is where the bulk of the money is being spent by the national Government, produced five of our team of 38 for the world swimming championships. It is the case that in the States there are centres of excellence. They deserve the support of a national government when we talk about producing elite athletes. The differentials are the same in athletics as they are in gymnastics, swimming and a number of other sports. If we look at the gymnastics program in Western Australia, we see that it has Andrei Rodionenko, who is arguably the best gymnastics coach for women in the world. Yet the support that program is getting from the national program is insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> I have argued in this place many times that it should be the case that funds distributed through the Australian Sports Commission to those programs should be allocated according to the quality of the programs. The factors that need to be taken into account are the quality of the athletes, the quality of the coaching and the sports medicine and science backup. In all of those programs where that is appropriate and the States are meeting the standards, there should be significant and greater contributions from the Federal Government. That does not mean additional resources. We have significant funding for sport and for elite sport at the moment. It means the reallocation of those resources which presently exist. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that the Swimming Coaches Association of Australia is asking for this to occur. It is something that needs to happen. There needs to be a focus of attention on decentralising our sporting funding when it comes to elite sport because athletes want to live near their homes. The majority of people are not living centrally in Canberra, they are living in the States and the capital cities, and that is where the funding should be directed. It is the case that for too long reports have been recommending this change and we have not undertaken it. </PARA>

<PARA> I had the privilege the other day of going to the Australian Institute of Sport and having breakfast with some of the sportsmen. They are being provided with training by international coaches.

It is asking Commonwealth bureaucracy to take some sort of a list of worthy recipients and dole out a very small amount of money to help them. Quite frankly, that does not work and it does not work on the figures that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) put forward. Of the 1,000 people who asked for donations, 200 were recipients. So the other 800-they are all, no doubt, taxpayers-contributed to the 200 successful applicants. That is not a terribly fair way, it does not pick winners and it is very selective in the way it goes about it. Obviously we have to look at how we achieve those particular results. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to the logic of this argument. Honourable members should remember that it is taxpayers' money that we are taking. The Commonwealth Government does not have any funds of its own; it gets it from the taxpayers and redistributes it out. If we did not put one penny back into sport, do honourable members think that netball, cricket, football, basketball-all those sports that have been played traditionally in Australia over many years-would disappear? Would they fold if the governments were not active in them? Of course not. We have to find a way to leave more money in people's pockets so that individuals can participate at that level. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, as a politician, if I were given the option of spending $20m on sport or $20m on the hospital system, I know where the money would go. In my electorate we have the tragedy of one hospital being so underfunded that it has stopped taking Medicare patients who need operations, other than those who need emergency surgery. That is a local tragedy. At the same time, one sees a grant of $100,000 going to a sporting complex down the road. Once again we are trying to pick winners rather than targeting money, which is really a Commonwealth and State joint responsibility, into areas of necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much agree with the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who came up with the idea of tax deductibility. When I look around this nation and see how it became great, I realise that it did so not because of bureaucrats giving little dobs of handouts here and there but because pioneers got off their butt and did things that were good for their communities. When one drives around my country electorate, one will suddenly find a hall or church built in the middle of nowhere. The people of that community, some 70, 80 or 100 years ago, or even 150 years ago, decided that that was where they wanted to spend their money, and that is where it went. The obligation on this Government, and on governments of all persuasions, is to have a smaller taxation base and to leave money in people's pockets, letting them decide which sports they would like to fund and how they want to go about it. The Government should not try to pick winners, as it has done, other than in those areas of obvious need, such as in elitist sport where Australia is represented in the Olympic Games and cricket and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the motion proposed by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) today, which calls on the Government, as part of its Budget planning process, to develop and reinstate the program dealing with local community sporting facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This phrase that the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) used-this notion of picking winners-is one which obsesses members opposite and one which is abused in very fundamental ways. I think we saw further evidence of that this morning. The motion calls for a program designed to ensure that the communities throughout Australia have the opportunity to enhance their sporting and recreational facilities, and to recognise the role that sport, physical fitness and recreation play both in encouraging the development of young people and in ensuring a healthy lifestyle for all people. Certainly in urban electorates like mine, where sporting facilities and other public infrastructure historically have been later in arriving than the development has been, this sort of program is particularly important because it is the catalyst to ensure other people contribute actively to sporting activities. </PARA>
<PARA> When the program was last in operation, two sets of grants were given to be applied in my area. One dealt with sporting facilities for the disabled, a group of people which all too often is neglected. With the greatest will in the world, no-one is going to come forward and cater for a minority group like that unless there is public financial support towards those facilities, as there has been. People who now utilise the facilities that those grants helped to provide have been much the better for it. As well as that, the grants in the last program were able to provide funding for new facilities for cricket at both the first grade and junior levels, and particularly training facilities. Again historically it has been difficult to get resources to provide them. Above all else, these grants ensured that other levels of government actively contributed to the development of sporting facilities, as has the community. As much as anything else, these grants form the catalyst for other people to participate in the development of sporting facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> One area which has needed attention is the development of women's sport. Historically, women's sport has not had the attention devoted to it that many of the male sports have had. In my own area the greatest participation in any sport is in netball, yet very little in the way of facilities has been provided for those who participate in that sport. However, we were told earlier, `Look, netball wouldn't finish if there was not public financial support'. That may be, but why not take the correct and appropriate view and say, `Why should not netballers have the opportunity to have facilities that ensure that they have courts which are safe and secure'? At the moment their facilities are second-rate ones and encourage ankle and knee injuries because they are so poor and not enough regard has been paid to them from all levels. Certainly there is not the corporate support that is given to many other sports, in spite of the fact that more people play netball than any other sport in areas such as the western part of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a responsibility to develop these programs in a way which says, `We're going to look at providing sporting infrastructure, not only for the major sports but also for the developing sports where the infrastructure facilities are poor'. This is particularly important when we talk about the development of the elite areas of sport. Sure, we want to provide funding for elite sporting activities, but let us not forget that real sporting excellence is achieved by getting people to develop their skills and participate actively in sporting endeavour. They may go on to become representative athletes as time goes on. But if they do not participate, they will miss the chance to get training and the basic skills and become great athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support this motion and I trust the Government will take it on board very seriously in the lead-up to this year's Federal Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House expresses concern at the deteriorating standard of living of those Australians in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>At the turn of the century a gentleman by the name of James Riley made a statement saying how important the farmers were to the community and the nation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Without the farmer the town cannot flourish. Ye men of the streets be cordial to our rustic brethren. They are more potent than bankers and lawyers, more essential to the public good than poets or politicians. Do all you can for them. Farmers should vibrate wisely and heartedly between the Public Square and the farm-and we of the same should do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>At this time in Australia's history farmers are facing hurt; in fact, rural Australia is hurting. Nothing highlights this better than the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics general projection that the net farm cash operating surplus will fall by 67 per cent this financial year, following a 20 per cent fall last year, and will fall a further 20 per cent fall next year. For some the fall in income will be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I was approached by a successful businessman in my electorate, who was emphatic that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) should come and spend a day on a farm in his district so that he could gain a first-hand understanding of the crisis that exists in rural Australia. It was suggested that if more city-based politicians were to spend a day in the country to gain an appreciation of the rural crisis, this Parliament might start making some decisions that will ensure we keep rural Australia alive. If they do not choose to visit the rural areas now, they certainly will not have the time later this year when the effects of the rural recession hit the economic base of our major metropolitan areas. They will then be far too busy trying to explain their Government's failed economic policies, but no-one at that time will be listening. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that many in the cities are also hurting, but I believe that the effects of the Federal Government's induced recession combined with low commodity prices are taking a greater toll in country areas. As in the metropolitan areas, unemployment is increasing in rural Australia as farms adjust to the dramatic reduction in their incomes by laying off staff and cutting spending. The one small compensation is that many of those now out of work have access to the unemployment benefits or some other allowance, although for many the payment is barely enough to feed and clothe their families. However, most farmers are entitled to nothing except a small family allowance payment, which is eagerly awaited by many families. Thank goodness members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia were able to stop the Federal Government, as announced in the Budget last August, applying an assets test to this allowance also. </PARA>
<PARA> Some families are entitled to the family allowance supplement of $53 per dependant per fortnight if their taxable income is less than $20,056, but this allowance is asset tested and, as farmers must have assets to be farmers, they are excluded from any assistance. This is despite the fact that they have very little, if any, cash flow. In many cases this is resulting in families surviving on budgets of $100 to $120 per week borrowed from the bank, and this is of great concern to me and also should be to the Federal Government and to this Parliament. Many of us in this building would not be able even to begin to comprehend this situation, or how we would begin to cope on such a minuscule income if we were placed in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA> With budgets like this something must give, and unfortunately in some cases it is the children's education. I appreciate that many on the Government side are ideologically opposed to private boarding schools, but for students in isolated areas of Australia it is their only access to high school education. This fact is recognised by governments through the payment of an isolated children's allowance. For each child who is forced to leave home and study because of isolation, a non-means tested, non-asset tested allowance of $1,500 is paid. Any additional payment is income and asset tested. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum allowance per year for primary school students is $2,912, for under 16-year-old high school students $3,235, and for those over 16 slightly more. However, the cost of tuition and board at an average boarding school is in the vicinity of $11,500 per year. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to calculate that there is a shortfall of approximately $8,000 per student per year that the parents have to pay. These costs are horrendous, especially when parents have two, three or four children away at school. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Isolated Children's and Parents Association (ICPA) is holding its annual conference in Bourke. As honourable members would be aware, the ICPA is one of the most effective lobby groups to visit this Parliament, and it is to be congratulated on the work it is doing to improve access to education for students in the isolated areas of Australia. Although welcoming the recent increase in the non-means and non-asset tested component of the assistance for isolated children's allowance to $1,500, the ICPA would like the total allowance increased to 55 per cent of the average cost of a boarding school. I am sure that many honourable members would agree that, given the difficulties and cost of education in isolated areas, this request is not unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, after having cut their spending to the bone, parents are now having to withdraw their children from boarding school. For those in extreme financial difficulties, this means bringing their children home and assisting them with their schooling by means of correspondence. However, in the main this is far from satisfactory because, apart from the social aspects, the children must rely heavily on their parents' time and educational skills. This is placing great stress on many families, because not being able to afford any labour means that both parents must spend a greater time helping each other outside, whilst at the same time the children need parental assistance with their correspondence lessons. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parents are driving their children excessive distances morning and afternoon in order to catch a school bus, and in some cases long distances to and from school. Apart from the physical toll on the child, any person who has driven in western New South Wales recently-and I have no doubt the situation is similar in other outback areas-would be extremely concerned if their spouse were on the road every day, because of the current plague of kangaroos. To avoid this some mothers are leaving their husbands and renting a house in their nearest major centre with a high school so that they can care for their children during the week. This is certainly not conducive to keeping families together. They return home only on weekends, and this often involves a 250- to 300-kilometre drive one way on dirt roads with the added danger of hitting a kangaroo, emu, goat, wild pig or domestic stock. </PARA>
<PARA> For others it will mean placing their children in a student hostel in their nearest major centre with a high school. However, these hostels only have limited vacancies, and cost approximately $4,500 per student per year, so some parents are going to find themselves in a very difficult situation. Recently, on a visit to an isolated town in New South Wales, I was approached by two ladies expressing concern that they could no longer afford to pay hostel boarding costs, and this would mean that they would have to withdraw their children from high school in their nearest provincial centre. These ladies are not farmers, but townsfolk on wages, and they cannot afford to pay the difference between the isolated children's allowance and that charged by the hostels. This is not the fault of the hostels because they also are victims of the Government's high income cost policy. This is just one indication of how the rural recession is affecting everyone in the country, and it is a particularly sad day-and a reflection on this Parliament-when the education of rural students is at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, unemployment is also rife in rural Australia. Managers and farm hands are being retrenched and in many cases they do not know where to go; nor do they have anywhere to go. When they lose their jobs they lose the roof over their heads, and finding suitable accommodation while the rural recession continues is becoming very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> With farmers watching every cent they spend and unemployment rising, businesses in country towns are also suffering, and this in turn is affecting industries in the city. The reliance our economy has on the rural sector was exemplified in 1983 when, after a several year drought broke and farmers started to spend again, the total economy picked up. The drought, of course, had a great deal to do with bringing down the government at that time. The reliance we have on the rural sector has not changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Businesses in country centres are hurting. They have tightened up as much as possible and are now starting to put off staff. Most businesses with a number of people are looking to where those staff can be relocated-or in most cases they are putting them off. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Federal Government does something to assist the rural sector, these centres will end up virtual ghost towns. I am not being dramatic, and I know my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) is going to say something about the effect of the rural recession on these rural towns which mean so much to people in rural areas. Of course-as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in a television broadcast recently said-what we are feeling now is the effect of high interest rates and high input costs that occurred over 18 months ago, so the rural recession really has not struck the capital cities, and when it does I feel sorry for those people who will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it there, and just call on the Government to try to do something about it. Whilst I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has said something about the measures to be taken to assist the rural sector-and I am very pleased to see he is to do something about the rural assistance scheme and other areas, and also is to help the wheat farmers-I believe it goes beyond that. Whilst very, very welcome, we need more than band-aid measures; we need something done very soon about what has happened to the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everybody recognises the important role that rural Australia plays in our economy and in developing this great nation, and we on this side of the House not only support rural Australia but in the last 12 months have worked through some of the toughest challenges and times that rural Australia has faced to bring together measures which are reflected not only in the long term interest of rural Australia but also in the short term, in regard to direct aid and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under these circumstances it is easy to understand political opportunism on the part of some honourable members of the Opposition, in utilising the downturn and the effect that that is having on the morale of farmers, to solicit votes. Over the last six to 12 months there has been a massive amount of politicking, particularly on the part of the National Party of Australia, in regard to the effect that the downturn in commodity prices is having on rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to rationally and logically go through the causes, and address those causes for the long term as well as for the short term. Regarding the short term solutions, the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) announced this week an increase from $64m to $160m for the rural adjustment scheme and, if need be next year, an increase to $240m. As well as that, the Minister announced $35m in compensation for the loss of sales of our grain to Iraq as a consequence of the embargo on Iraq and the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the long term solutions, it is important that we improve and proceed to have a fully integrated transport system in this nation. There is a massive saving of approximately $4 billion to be made if we are able to improve our transport system. It does require the support of all the six States; it does require goodwill, and it does require concessions by all parties if we are to get that system up and running. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the waterfront, this Government is the only government which has addressed the problems of the waterfront. The criticism now is that we are not doing it quickly enough. As I said in a debate earlier in this House, if we climbed Mount Everest the Opposition would want us to climb to the moon. The point is we are addressing this problem sensibly and rationally, but it takes time. The reason it has never been addressed before is that it has been put in the too-hard basket. Previous governments have not wanted to address the problem because they felt it was too hard to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government took a further step recently and sent a bipartisan mission to the United States Administration, which I was pleased to be on, to state our case and to show the Americans the effects their enhancement programs are having on us. Of course, we are taking the fight to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at every opportunity to try to break down the corrupted trade practices of the Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather ironic that Europe gave birth to this nation yet has tried ever since to suffocate us by the most corrupt trade practices the world has ever seen. The behaviour of the cowards in the European countries that belong to the European Community does them little credit. Unfortunately, a lot of politicking has gone on with regard to the serious downturn in agriculture. One of the results of the National Party jumping on the bandwagon at many of the rallies we have had across Australia, gleefully urging farmers to take out their wrath on the Federal Government, has been to convince bankers and businesses that farmers do not have a great future. They do have a great future. As a result, farmers are paying 5 to 6 per cent more in interest rates than anybody else. I lay the blame for that directly at the feet of those people who tried right at the start to politicise this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to looking at policies or alternative propositions for agriculture, I think it is a fair judgment to say that National Party members are political transvestites, wearing a different dress when they go to a different audience, and telling farmers not the facts but what they think the farmers want to hear. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party has caught itself out. A classic example of this has been the argument on tariffs: `Nationals split on backing tariff cut'. For years and years the National Party has politicised the Government's attempt to bring down tariffs and to get the tariff monkey off the back of farmers. The tariff cuts set out in the industry statement will mean a reduction in costs for farmers of $350m to $400m. It is a wonderful decision, yet the National Party is still in a time warp, still supporting over-regulation and the tariff monkey, still agonising over the tariff cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who has been a supporter of maintaining the sugar embargo and maintaining high tariffs, is now agonising. Like the US 7th Cavalry chasing the Comanches, he is caught up with his own stupid rhetoric. The fact is that, by dropping tariffs, end users of sugar in Australia are more competitive; there is less pressure on the consumer price index; and we are in a better position to argue in the GATT. The reality of sugar is that 80 per cent of our market has to be found overseas. To be a short term populist the honourable member for Dawson has made himself look like a goose on this issue. The only other person in north Queensland who has supported him on this is his ridiculous mate, the editor of the Proserpine newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the other issues and at the behaviour of the National Party, we have the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of Australia saying that we would use United States bases as a last resort bargaining chip. That man has no understanding of foreign affairs, no understanding of our national security and our long term interests, to come up with such a stupid comment. The frightening thing is that he is the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. I think we are safe, though. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Liberals are doing. One headline said about Malcolm Fraser-I am sure that some honourable members opposite will remember who he was:</PARA>
<PARA>Libs Lost in Bush-Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that there was no coalition policy on rural Australia. Another report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Malcolm Fraser . . . has accused the Opposition on its lack of rural policies; a crisis committee has been set-up because of the disenchantment with the Liberal Party . . . comments by Malcolm Fraser . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Because things are so tough in the bush the time for rhetoric, the time for populist short term answers, has long gone. What farmers want and need is the truth. If we are going to look after their long term interests, we have to make the tough decisions-not throw money at the issue, because that is not the answer. We have responded with the rural adjustment scheme in the right and proper way because that money is targeted to farmers most in need. But we still have the subsidy can being pushed on the other side. As I have said, it is unfortunate that at every meeting the rhetoric changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing about the high moral ground the National Party has taken is that when it comes to costs it is the party that is going to support a 15 per cent goods and services tax that will go onto the price of food, clothing, and all the input costs across the board. In itself that will drive down the ability of people to buy our own farm products. It will push inflation through the roof, which again will eat away at the viability of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not enough, the National Party supports getting rid of Medicare. Because farmers are doing it so tough, the majority of them do not have the opportunity at the present time to purchase private medical insurance. So the farmers who are doing it tough would be the first victims of the right wing, ultra-trendy group in the Liberal and National parties which is going to give the flick to the very social structures that we in government have set up. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to support for farmers, again it should be recognised that there is a subsidy on diesel fuel of $850m, of which half goes to agriculture. With the Gulf war, the fluctuations in fuel prices impacted directly on farmers, particularly in the grain industry. The Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) was out there saving between 2c and 8c a litre right across the board. What is the Opposition's policy on the PSA? It wants to abolish it-the very mechanism protecting the farmers and all other users of fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that I have not forgotten but which the National Party would love to forget is the $30m drought rort that went into the pockets of a bunch of greedy graziers. That money could well be used now to help those farmers who are in need. What happened? Under the National Party in Queensland, over five years $30m went into the hands of a bunch of rip-off merchants instead of being targeted to those people most in need. The National Party has the audacity to come into this House and pretend that it cares about farmers. What it cares about is its mates with their heads in the trough right up to their ears, getting as much as they can, and still with the tariff monkey on their backs. They have not got rid of the McEwenism disease that imposed a massive weight on farmers and affected our ability to export. The National Party has never had the courage to get into micro-economic reform. It dropped the ball eight years ago and it is not going to get it back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was surprised to hear from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice)-particularly as chairman of the rural task force-the tirade we have just had. I say to the honourable member and to all those on the Government side of the House that the motion before us today is not simply a case of political opportunism. As far as this Opposition is concerned, it is not in the too hard basket. In fact, I would suggest to the Government that we on this side of the House are the only group that in government will come to grips with the real need for micro-economic reform, whether it be in the area of a goods and services tax, on the waterfront, industrial relations, and the like. A lot of what the honourable member for Hinkler said was absolute rubbish. He is really out of touch with what is going on in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion expresses concern about the deteriorating living standards in rural areas. I would go further than that and say that not only is there concern but for many in provincial and rural areas there is very real and deepening hardship . The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) talked principally about the problem on-farm. In the very short period I have available, I would like to talk about the provincial city impact of the problem he raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I use as an example the city of Toowoomba, which is at the centre of my electorate of Groom. For those who do not know, it is a city of about 90,000 people. It is the second largest inland city in Australia, not simply a provincial centre but now a microcosm of everything economically that happens in this country. Two and a half years ago it was voted in the national press-rightly or wrongly-as the best place in Australia to live. Whether that was because of its educational facilities, its health facilities or its housing standards I really do not know, but I take the opportunity generally to support that contention. It remains the best place in Australia to live; but it is in danger of becoming a city without a soul. That is not as a result of anything the city has done but as a result of the recession we had to have.</PARA>
<PARA> My comments today are particularly directed at three Ministers: firstly, the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-that Treasurer responsible for the `recession we had to have'; secondly, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), with the portfolio responsibility for those 700,000 small businesses out there across our nation; and, thirdly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who of course has the responsibility for that subset of the small business sector which provides about 40 per cent of our export income, not an insignificant proportion of the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look around the city of Toowoomba, what do I see? I see farm machinery dealers very much in the grips of the recession-farm machinery dealerships closing. We see seed merchants struggling to make ends meet and, in fact, we have heard recently of plantings being down as much as 40 per cent. As the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) quite rightly said, education is a very important area, particularly boarding education. I have 10 or 12 boarding schools in my electorate; it is therefore a very important element. In fact, all schools are reporting to me a general downturn in enrolments, particularly in years seven and eight, as a result of inadequate provisions for isolated children. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this morning I checked in my electorate to get a rough idea of the number of retail outlets and empty shops in the central business district of Toowoomba. We did a quick calculation and it seems that there are something like 80 shops empty in the central business district of Toowoomba, a city of 90,000 people. That, I think, clearly exemplifies the problems afflicting rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making comments upon the standard of living in rural areas, the subject of this motion before the House, I have to reinforce and agree with some of the comments that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) passed with regard to the actions of the Government in assisting people right across Australia, not just in rural Australia. The honourable member for Hinkler did pass comments about actions pertaining particularly to rural Australia and the benefits which will flow to the people there. He did mention some of the changes contained in the 12 March industry statement, and how there is conflict still between the Liberal Party and the National Party with regard to the effects and the worth of some of those changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I feel that the general populace of Australia, particularly rural Australia, is coming to realise that we have to shake off the shackles of the past and that in doing that there is some degree of pain, but that, as we move towards the future, those jobs, the employment possibilities, and the wealth of the nation will be enhanced if we are prepared to shoulder those changes and to go ahead positively and productively into the future, and not with negative aspects. It is with regret that I have to comment on the fact that too many members of the National Party are still beating about the bush with negative comments, taking up some of the tougher things that we have had to do and simply illustrating those things to the people in the bush, without illustrating the positive things. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the conflict between the Liberal and National parties on the removal of the tariffs, as was illustrated so clearly by the honourable member for Hinkler, is just one of those areas that they just do not seem to be able, or are not prepared, to come to grips with. I know that in my electorate 60 years of neglect was finally put paid to at the last election with the demise of the National Party up there, and it will certainly continue with the State election coming up very shortly, I would presume. Some of the changes that are occurring there, I think, illustrate just the way that the people's perceptions of what is happening will be taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the pleasure towards the end of last year of being at a regional Country Women's Association conference of delegates from branches from not just in my electorate but from the whole coast. In opening the conference, the Mayor of Lismore, Alderman Harold Fredericks, passed the remark that things were a little tough, but that it was senseless for us to talk down the economy in the bush and to talk down the economy in general. He also passed the comment that things were also not so bad in the City of Lismore, the area that he knows so well. He said that that area, particularly the coastal area, was doing quite satisfactorily, and he was most peeved that a number of delegates were prepared to simply talk down the economy in a political sense for a political gain. I must point out to honourable members that the Mayor of Lismore is not a member of the Australian Labor Party, but is indeed a member of the National Party. </PARA>

There are lots of things that we have done in the bush to help people, and I will just run through some of them very quickly. The actions of the Government with the rural adjustment scheme, putting in more packages to help farmers remain viable by subsidising interest costs, is one thing. Our changes regarding the cost of phone calls, which have been now put through Cabinet, are again something to help out people in the bush. Our changes with Austudy have helped people there with income. We have raised the threshold level on assets, with a little bludgeoning from both the country task force members and perhaps the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey)- although we did not take a great deal of notice of it! We knew we were going to get it through anyway. The pension increases and the increases in unemployment benefits-all those things are to assist the people out in the bush.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the standard of living in rural areas, the subject of the motion before the House, I had to do no more than go to my desk this morning and pick up today's mail. I do not want to tell people my views on this matter. I thought it an ideal opportunity to read from some of those letters and give people in this place what people in the country are saying about this Government. This is a small business man and a farmer. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>With respect, our plight on the farm and indeed in the country anywhere, is akin to that of the Israelites in the land of Egypt of long ago. We labour long and hard for what has now become a pittance and before we get that pittance the largest slice of all times has been taken away in costs and propups. We are then taxed indirectly and as well as directly to fatten a lot of greedy bureaucrats . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is signed by a Mr Ridgway from Coomberdale. I have a copy of a letter from Cunderdin addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This lady says:</PARA>
<PARA>I left school at 11 years of age to help on my father's farm, during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA>I have worked, ever since my marriage in 1954, to help my husband on our moderately-sized farm. After good seasons and poor seasons, we felt that in 1988 we could buy a small additional parcel of land . . . Although we have, since purchasing this extra land, met ALL production &amp;budget schedules, &amp;spent a minimum of money on any unnecessary items at all, we now face the possibility of being unable to carry on our business. </PARA>
<PARA>She points out the following: wheat prices halved; wool prices less than half; meat and sheep unsaleable; freight up; fertiliser up; chemicals continually rising; fuel risen; machinery and auto parts risen 50 per cent-and of course, she says, the shearing is going on. I have another letter from a person who wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Keating):</PARA>
<PARA>I write on behalf of my son and daughter-in-law . . . In spite of having met production levels in wheat, coarse grain, wool and lambs, according to the Budget schedule for 1990 . . . actual Farm Income is reduced to less than half!! Reluctantly, he &amp;his wife &amp;children travelled 160 kms to apply for family allowance, or at least see if they were eligible; only to be told at the office, that `We are out of application forms. You'll have to come back when we get some more forms . . . ` If it were not so serious and soul-destroying, it would ALL make a first rate FARCE. Are human lives &amp;feelings really totally so VALUELESS to you &amp;your party-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first 12 years of development of a bush property, John, another lady's husband, held another off-farm job. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems unbelievable that now I will be required to seek a full time off farm job-just to keep the farm. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 25 years we have had this farm we have generated a great deal of overseas income-2-2.5 million dollars by our estimation and still after 25 years of work and careful living we have had to battle to make ends meet. The interest rate policy of the current Government has brought us to this desperate state. </PARA>
<PARA> The discrimination against people who live in country areas is a disgrace, in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Country people have children to educate (a very costly business if so isolated)-</PARA>
<PARA>and the government has not done enough-</PARA>
<PARA>doctors to visit and we would like access to the services that city people enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA>Someone else said:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1988 wool income has been reduced by $70,000 even though the quality and quantity of the wool for our 7,200 sheep has increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Income from sheep sales has been cut to one third of previous sales and barely covers freight and commission and killing charges. Grain income from 350 acres has reduced by 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The letters go on:</PARA>
<PARA> Our own living allowance hasn't increased for two years being $750 per month.</PARA>
<PARA> This year we are expecting to run a deficit budget of $33,000. </PARA>
<PARA>These people have told me that they bought their farm without debt. They have no higher purchase commitments. Another said:</PARA>
<PARA> The once lucrative live sheep trade seems to have been ruined by political misunderstanding and incompetence and it is high time people whose responsibility it is to fix this problem, get off their `backsides' and fix it. </PARA>
<PARA>We know who these people were talking about-the Government. One gentleman sent me his latest notice, dated 25 March 1991, from his bank telling him that his interest rate is 17 per cent and 20 per cent if he goes over his limit. What does that have to do with the Government's reduced interest rates? Members of the Government can tell us in here what they are. This is what the bank is telling my constituent. That is the situation in the bush and that is why living standards are falling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) finished his speech by criticising the banks. Rightly so; he should criticise the banks. That is why at present there is an inquiry into the activities of the banks. He really highlighted the fact about what the banks are actually doing to a lot of people, but it is not restricted to rural Australia by any means. He highlighted the point about set interest rates of 17 per cent and the fact that once those people go over their overdraft limit they finish up paying in excess of that. It is a very valid point, about the only thing on which I would agree with him. That is not necessarily the Government's fault; that is the free enterprise system that the banks operate under that creates that. The market forces determine that. It is an area that I believe needs attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) refer to the assets test on family allowance. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) actually supported an assets test on that in line with the Government's proposal. He was rolled in his party room, which we are all very well aware of. Honourable members need to be reminded again that that particular assets test was net of debt. That is often not mentioned by the Opposition. That is a very important thing. The family allowance helps a lot of people throughout our community. In that particular instance, it was something that needed to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Education has been talked about a lot in the rural sector as well. We talk about ghost towns and such things in certain areas. I noticed there was a lot of talk by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling about the people on the land. There was not a lot of discussion about the workers in the rural sector and the workers in the towns. Over a number of years, when working for a bank in Queensland-I spent quite a bit of time in rural areas-a lot of times we found that people from the rural sector, the farmers themselves, ignored a lot of the country towns and always wanted to be associated with the large cities. In the good times they would all go off to the big cities in their planes and Mercedes-Benz cars to take advantage of things there instead of supporting those local towns. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember, when I was the President of the Australian Bank Employees Union, going into bat at one stage for a little town whose branch of the bank was going to close. Naturally, we wanted to keep that open for employment reasons for our own members. I found out during the course of all this that the business in the bank had dropped off so much that it was not a viable proposition to keep it open any more. That rural sector is in the electorate of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). It is a place called Forest Hill. No-one shopped around Forest Hill any more; they were all shopping in Gatton. Hence, the business for the bank was no longer viable there. Of course, it finished up as an agency that opened for a few hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there is a big problem in Ivanhoe about a branch of the Commonwealth Bank closing down. That is a disgrace. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling was right to take that issue up. At least the Commonwealth Bank is still open in some rural areas of Australia. If it were sold off, as the Opposition would like, we would certainly have no rural representation for that banking sector. We need to look at how some of these small towns are supported. The people who work in these businesses suffer a lot from that. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn to a case in Queensland. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) is the chairman of the country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which I am pleased to be associated with as well. I found it quite interesting, moving around Queensland-particularly in the Federal seat of Kennedy at one stage-to notice the big problems there. The problems have not been caused by this Federal Government. They have been caused after 32 years of National-Liberal Party rule in Queensland. Fortunately, that is now being corrected, but it is going to take the Goss Government in Queensland some time to fix that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It was amazing to talk to some of those people in that area. They were more critical of what actually happened in those times. When we talk about rural Australia we have to look at our Aboriginal people because there is still a large percentage of Aboriginal people in rural Australia. These days something like 60 per cent live in urban Australia. In Queensland, in particular, they were dreadfully treated by the former National Party and Liberal Party governments. Those problems have to be corrected. They certainly will be addressed, in time, by the Queensland Government. I know it is giving it a very high priority. All those areas, including education, are areas that need attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Events at the New Zealand Stock Exchange yesterday have forced me to rise today to ask the Government to come forth with a full explanation of the present financial situation of Qantas Airways Ltd, the true story behind the investment of Qantas in Air New Zealand and what arrangements have been made between Qantas, Japan Airlines, American Airlines and Brierley Investments Ltd (BIL). Yesterday the New Zealand Stock Exchange was advised that Qantas admitted that agreements that it has with Brierley Investments could result in it controlling 35 per cent of Air New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the notice did not make clear the circumstances in which Qantas would be taking over control of the 15 per cent of Air New Zealand presently held by Brierley. At a time when the Government is trying to move towards the partial privatisation of Qantas, at a time when Qantas is facing unbelievable losses, a full investigation and a full disclosure of some of the activities of Qantas must be forthcoming. The records of the Qantas investment in Air New Zealand make very interesting reading indeed. When Qantas moved into Air New Zealand its report of 30 June 1989 showed that the Qantas share of 19.99 per cent of Air New Zealand cost it some $NZ232m. </PARA>
<PARA> There was another fascinating aspect of that too because of the arrangements that it had with Japan Airlines, American Airlines and, indeed, with BIL to ensure that British Airways did not get into the deal. The reports also show that there was $NZ162m that acted as loans to the other shareholders to try to stitch up that particular deal. </PARA>
<PARA> In actual fact, Qantas paid a surcharge to take over its share of the Air New Zealand deal. It would appear that the New Zealand Government price for the sale of Air New Zealand was $2.357 per share, but the Qantas report of 30 June 1989 shows that Qantas paid $4.14 per share-a premium of $NZ100m. We are now aware that American Airlines has taken up its option and wants out of that deal and Qantas may have to take over that shareholding. There is some doubt as to whether or not Qantas may be forced to take over the Brierley shareholding as well. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Qantas is facing losses, variously estimated to be between $356m and $500m for the year, I think that the people of Australia and the Parliament need a full explanation of what is going on in Qantas. The statements by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) in recent weeks do not give one much confidence in terms of what is happening at Qantas. It was Minister Beazley who refused to give his endorsement, or vote of confidence, to the directors of Qantas Airways, or indeed to the management. Honourable members might remember his statement that he had confidence in the Chairman of Qantas, Mr Dix, but he refused to give his endorsement to any other of the major players. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going on at Qantas? It is absolutely amazing when one of its major competitors, such as Singapore Airlines, can say it has had a dreadful year and its profits are down 8 per cent to $US400m, or when Thai International can say it has had a dreadful year, its profits are down 9 per cent and it is making only $US386m, or when Cathay Pacific can say it has had a dreadful year because of fuel prices and the Gulf war and its profits are down to about $US400m. But Qantas blames the pilots strike, the increase in fuel prices and the Gulf for a $125m loss last year and a loss of up to half a billion this year, and there are estimates of what might happen in the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard time and again from the Government how well it has got Qantas on line. Yet we hear that Qantas is going to have to sack some 5,000 staff members. What is going on? Twelve months ago we heard that Qantas was going to have a major reduction in its senior staff. I would like to know how many senior staff have gone. I understand the number is very tiny indeed. We also heard as recently as last month that there were to be massive cuts in Qantas management. Following press reports that high-flying Qantas executives may be forced to take salary cuts in a brutal cost cutting campaign to curb the airline's already devastating losses, within 10 days we found out that a salary cut of 5 per cent for senior management of Qantas had turned out to mean no loss of income for most of the executives it was supposed to affect. The Qantas executives had an extra rostered day off per month and they were going to give that up. That was going to be the cost savings. As one Qantas executive said, who has ever heard of a company which gave its senior executives an extra day off to work 19 days a month?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government must come clean with some of the commercial deals that have been done by Qantas and what has been the cost of those. They were heralded less than two years ago as being the most amazing arrangements with Lufthansa and American Airlines, so there would be code sharing and traffic sharing. Those deals amounted to absolutely nothing. There must be a disclosure of some of the commercial dealings that Qantas has done with some of the consolidators around the place. What sort of yield is Qantas getting on some of those fares it is selling at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> What we would like to know and to understand is this: what are the circumstances surrounding the departure of John Menadue two years ago as the chief executive officer of Qantas? His was a Government appointment; yet he left in mysterious circumstances with a deal being done between Menadue, the board and the senior executives of Qantas. Agreements were signed that nobody would talk about the reason for his demise. Yet we have found out that during the period he was in charge of Qantas there was a massive explosion of staff, that all the commercial decisions have proved to be wrong and now some 5,000 Qantas staff have to be retrenched. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to know how much of a say the Government has had in the day-to-day running of Qantas. Is it true that there is a hot line between the various Ministers and the Qantas management? Is it true when Qantas management complains that it receives up to eight ministerial directives a day? These questions must be answered. Yet the Government is on the record as saying that it is doing all the right things. One can go through the public statements of Ministers Beazley and Willis over the years. It is not too long ago-in fact, less than two years, on 1 June-when the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), referring to government business enterprises, cited Qantas as having a performance that was absolutely outstanding. He said that the Qantas performance within the environment created by the Hawke Government was quite spectacular. He said that Qantas had created a context of more innovative and creative commercial decisions. We applaud that. As we go through all these references we find that we have an airline that is a shell of its former self. It is in an unbelievable financial mess and it is an absolute basket case. There must be a full disclosure of what the real financial situation is at Qantas, because the Government is in the turmoil at the moment of trying to work out how it will have the capacity to privatise 49 per cent of the airline. </PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation is not all about having fire sales of government assets. If we have a financial basket case with the national carrier, what is the Government going to do to get over that situation? Privatisation must be about efficiencies and competition and of being able to bring more affordable air fares to the people of Australia and for international visitors coming here. Yet we are expecting losses of up to half a billion dollars this year and perhaps even more next year. What future does Qantas have under this regime?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition urges the Government, as a matter of priority, to have a very good and close look at what is happening with the Qantas board. Mr Beazley has made a couple of changes, but what Qantas needs more than anything is a high-flying commercialised board-a board made up of proven performers in private industry-to try to get the airline back into some sort of shape so it can go towards privatisation and so the taxpayers of Australia, who are the shareholders in Qantas, have the opportunity of getting some real return when the 49 per cent privatisation comes about. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is in an awful mess. This House and the shareholders of Qantas-the taxpayers of Australia-have a real need to know exactly what the true financial situation is. They have a need to know exactly what is going on and to have a realisation of the unbelievable mess that this Government has managed to make of one of the world's proudest airline carriers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to publicly expose the maladministration and improper financial management of the Queensland Justices Association Inc. (QJA). My allegations come from a past president, a past vice-president and past senior officers of the QJA and are the result of a four-month investigation into the past and present activities of one Peter MacDonald, the full time registrar of the QJA who is also the owner and full time manager of the Peter MacDonald consultancy firm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The allegations have been documented and they include the gross financial mismanagement of the QJA over eight years when MacDonald was part time and full time registrar, as shown by the fact that through improper practices and sheer incompetence MacDonald has turned a highly profitable organisation into one facing a massive financial loss. In 1983, it had $65,000 in reserves in a working account. Last year it recorded a massive loss of $57,274, and this was despite the fact that membership fees blew out from $6 a year to $30 a year and a number of profitable business ventures were introduced; for example, JP plaques, costing $95 each-although the QJA received only $4-video training tapes at $50 each; an upgraded journal; a JP travel service; a JP insurance plan; JP stamps at $25; ID cards at $12.50; and badges. Remember, this is an association that has something like 10,000 members. </PARA>
<PARA> MacDonald is accused of blatantly misusing his position as registrar for his own commercial ends and personal financial advantage. This has been demonstrated by the figures that have been presented to me by these people. He broke a personal and formal undertaking given on 10 September 1985 when he said he would declare all profits he was making through the QJA and he has not honoured that. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, over this period he has made massive amounts of money for himself. He has turned this organisation, which in 1983 had outgoings of $45,000, into one which in 1989 had outgoings of $150,000. He has made massive changes in registration fees for himself and in clerical assistance which he has used. He is accused of manipulating the Association's accounts so that everything possible has to go through his consultancy firm. He operates from the same office, yet the Association pays 85 per cent of the rent of an unknown lease controlled by his consultancy firm. </PARA>
<PARA> He is employed as a full time registrar, yet he operates a full time consultancy firm using the QJA office, using the QJA computer, using the QJA staff-except for one person-the fax machine, the phone numbers and the legal advisers. But in the Queensland Business Directory Peter MacDonald Consultancy is listed as employing five to nine staff and it is supposed to have an expensive NCR computer. This is simply not true. He has even had the QJA put in a new, expensive telephone system, and he lists the entry in bold print in the telephone directory as his numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> MacDonald has blatantly misused his position for personal profit, illustrated by the fact that on 18 June 1988, in his capacity as the full time registrar, MacDonald ran a justice of the peace (JP) seminar. He has tried to smother that fact and has covered up the actual accounts; but invoice No. 661 reveals some of the story. Despite the fact that he was a full time registrar on a substantial annual retainer, he charged $1,000 for his own consultancy services and for himself to attend his own seminar. </PARA>
<PARA> During the same period leading up to the seminar and its aftermath, he charged the QJA another $1,000 in fees. He charged the Association $500 for rent and $2,827.28 for clerical assistance during the period. He claimed $1,624 for advertisements in a major newspaper. He declared an income for the seminar of $2,695, but he charged the Association $3,374 just for advertising, room hire and his personal attendance fee. There are no records of the true cost of running the seminar, of the venue or of advertising. There are no records of the true cost of rental or of the running of the QJA office. There are no records of the true cost of manufacturing the JP plaques, the JP stamps or printing the JP journal Justice . . . and the JP. Everything goes through MacDonald's consultancy firm. He bills the QJA without full substantiation, and the QJA has just paid up. Even the new legal adviser who was employed by the QJA is somehow on MacDonald's payroll. On one occasion the net wages were being paid by the QJA but MacDonald's firm was paying the group tax. I am sure that the Australian Taxation Office ought to have a look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been strange goings-on with the non-payment of workers compensation for QJA employees. There is also a need to investigate a claim by MacDonald's firm for the payment of wages for an employee who had long since resigned and did not even claim her full entitlements. There is a need to investigate allegations of the misuse of proxy votes to elect a council sympathetic to MacDonald. There is also a need to investigate claims that he falsely gave information about the right of the QJA to conduct a State-wide postal ballot to elect its officers. He failed to include nomination forms in the journal prior to the annual general meeting. He failed to send proxy forms to members. He has blatantly kept information from the membership. There was even an attempt to cover up the loss of $57,274. The annual reports were significantly changed last year to cover up income and expenditure details. </PARA>
<PARA> His strategy has been to demand that all key accounts are handled by his consultancy firm. There is no information about hidden commissions or the topping-up costs. The allegations go on. He unconstitutionally signed an annual return in 1988. He even waged a campaign by legal action against his own members and his own branches. He even took one branch on the Gold Coast to court. He has removed any council members who questioned him-even presidents and vice-presidents. In 1984 MacDonald was accused by his critics of milking the Queensland Justices Association. Since that time he has finetuned his operations. Because of the incompetence, particularly of the present President, Mrs Clancy, he has continued to be able to make massive financial personal profits from this association. He has been protected by his cronies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Merle Clancy, in the last edition of the journal Justice . . . and the JP, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The allegations that are being raised now by myself and ex-presidents and many other executive members are``old hat''. </PARA>
<PARA>She claims that they were investigated in 1989 by the Corporate Affairs Commission, which, after a full investigation, `found they had no substance'. I quote from an official letter from the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs, Mr J. V. M. Green, following his investigation of Peter MacDonald's activities and the QJA administration. Commissioner Green says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . breaches of provisions of the Companies (Queensland) Code have occurred and there have been numerous occasions when the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association have not been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that sections 274 and 275 of the code have been breached, as well as clauses 26 and 35 of the articles of association. He talks also about auditors and solicitors not being properly appointed, the registrar acting wrongly at annual meetings and even the president being illegally elected because he was too old. </PARA>
<PARA> The most damning aspect here regarding Peter MacDonald was exposed also by the Commissioner. He exposed that MacDonald, even though he was the one, as a full time registrar, who set up this JP journal for the Association and the business JP Plaques, actually registered the journal and the plaques in his own company's name: Melkadee Pty Ltd. Commissioner Green says:</PARA>
<PARA>I consider the Committee should require the details of his (MacDonald's) business interests connected with the Association to be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA>I see it as being inconsistent with the provisions that the Registrar . . . should be able to use the organisation to make profits for himself to the degree that a commercial advantage is being obtained by him or to obtain a significant personal advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Green says:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless there is strict compliance in regard to the abovementioned directions, steps will be taken for you--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Association-</PARA>
<PARA>to show cause why the licence under which the Association is incorporated should not be revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we have a president saying, `It is old hat; there is no substance to it.' This president has tried to cover up the blatant misuse of association funds. The council, under the leadership of Merle Clancy, has closed its eyes to MacDonald's practices. It has never challenged him for a billing system to know what it has been paying. It appointed people whenever he wanted them. There is still no accountability of MacDonald's use of the Association's office, equipment or finances, yet Mrs Clancy goes on and says that the allegations have no substance and were supposed to be old hat. Mrs Clancy, like MacDonald, has blatantly lied to the members of the Association and like MacDonald she has been part of an attempted cover-up for MacDonald to use the Association for his personal financial benefit. She should immediately resign her position; so should those other councillors who have been involved in this conspiracy to cover up. </PARA>
<PARA> As for MacDonald, his whole sordid role in the Queensland Justices Association should immediately be investigated, not only by the Queensland Attorney-General, but also by the Australian Taxation Office. For eight years MacDonald has milked the QJA for his own financial benefits. He has abused his position as registrar of a most reputable organisation. He has been aided and abetted by a number of incompetent, irresponsible people such as Mrs Clancy, who is also a blatantly dishonest person. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come to put an end to MacDonald's sinister control of the QJA, so there will really be justice for the people of Queensland. This issue has been there for eight years. People tried back in 1984 to do something about MacDonald, but this man was very powerful in the old days because he is also the private minder and private journalist of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. He has even waged legal actions against individuals who criticised him and used QJA funds, legal funds, to carry out those vendettas-yet the settlements and judgments were to go to him. Clearly this is a case that has to be exposed and, despite other matters that I hope to raise tonight in the adjournment debate, I believe these matters ought to be taken up by the Queensland Attorney-General and also by the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave of the House to table documents from the Commissioner of Corporate Affairs and other matters that relate to business names in this connection. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate to discuss matters related to young people and unemployment rates. One of the great tragedies that this country is facing today is the fact that 24 to 25 per cent of our young people aged 15 to 19 are unemployed. That reflects very much, I believe, on the policies of this Government and the policies which have been in place over a period of six or seven years. The tragedy, of course, is that some in the Government quite genuinely would like to have made certain reforms within the waterfront and shipping, with industrial relations in particular. But unfortunately for Australia and for many families and young people the Government has not had the capacity to do it. The Government has obviously been bound to two particular groups of people in this country for the last seven or eight years and is now faced with a recession. We have not got the structural changes which could have been brought about and which would have benefited many young people and many families and far fewer people in this country would have been thrown on to the unemployment scrap heap than otherwise would have been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just go back over some of the figures so that people are reminded of the unemployment situation which we are faced with at this stage. The Government, of course, has been very keen to compare the record of the past coalition government with its record. We find that average unemployment in the Fraser years was 6.3 per cent; under the Hawke years, at the moment it is 7.95 per cent and on the way up. Of course, as people realise, it is now sitting at 9.2 per cent. This means that at the highest period under the Fraser years, 676,000 people were unemployed. Now there are 777,000 people unemployed, on seasonally adjusted figures-just over 100,000 more than the highest figure under the Fraser Government. Over eight years of the Hawke Government, the unemployment rate, on average, has been 25 per cent higher than the average rate during the eight years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians have suffered because employment opportunities have not been there for them. So we are now faced with a set of circumstances where a large number of our young people are unemployed and an increasing number of people in middle age and getting up into their fifties are also finding themselves out of work. Of course, this leads to a loss of self-esteem, particularly amongst our young people. They have a sense of failure and are disillusioned with their society and the community in which they live. Out of that comes, after a few months or years, a great degree of cynicism about the policies and the society in which they are now placed. Not only is there within the person this loss of self-esteem and disillusionment, but also for the nation there is the loss of the skill base within our country. It is very important that our young people can develop skills with which they can contribute to community life-whether it be within their families or in being really positive contributors and participants rather than people who need other people's support. Those skills and skills which are of economic benefit to the country are developed during those vital years, yet we are failing to encourage that as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to a couple of illustrations where this Government has failed dismally, even though it says it is very positive about encouraging investment and development and providing opportunities for people to be employed. Coronation Hill is a classic example, as is the Wesley Vale project, one which is very close to my electorate. Many people who would have been employed on that project live at Wesley Vale within my electorate. I believe the Federal Government really wanted that project; the State Government wanted that project; the local community wanted that project; but when it came to the point the Government was prepared to bow to political pressure from the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though the Government generally says it is positive about business investment and encouraging business opportunities, the consequence of this is that every time a major project comes up, it ultimately takes a course of action which prevents its development. As this occurs year after year, in 1991 the job market is shrinking rapidly. It is a great tragedy for many of our young people that they have to sit at home, work out what they are going to do the next day, decide which video they are going to go out and hire, hire it and then go home and sit in the lounge room. It is a very devastating experience for many of these young people. The Government did have the capacity and still has an opportunity to do something about this by changing the industrial relations system within this country, changing and sharpening up the waterfront and the shipping area. If we did this the country would be far more competitive. Our business operations in this country would grow and develop and as a consequence there would be more investment. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment investment in Australia is at a horrific low. That is why there are no employment opportunities. Twenty-five per cent of our 15-to 19-year-olds are sitting at home, going to the beach, wandering the streets, sitting down at the supermarkets, chatting, and filling in time because the Government has not taken the tough decisions to make us competitive and viable. It had the opportunity and fluffed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group to which the Government is beholden is the trade union movement, particularly the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). If the Government could remove itself from the shackles of the ACTU, it could take some of the policy directions that it would like to have taken. There are some in the Government-I know because I have talked to some of them-who would like to have gone down a different path. We know from some of the statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that he would have liked to have gone down a different path, but could not do so because the union movement would not allow him. So we have a government here that now has got to a point of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two real crises in the country: one is within the Government and the other is out there at the grassroots of Australian society, young people and families. Families do not know whether they are going to have a breadwinner next week or the week after and young people have never had the opportunity to earn bread. The other crisis in this country is that the Government is preoccupied within itself, with its internal struggles, with its leadership debate. There were discussions even this week by one of the factions on whether it should keep the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or have a look at Paul. It is these sorts of preoccupations which the Government ought to move away from. </PARA>
<PARA> I would encourage the Government to get those things behind it and to present some vision for Australia, because young people and families are desperately crying out for opportunity, for a reward for effort. They are prepared to put in the effort, to get into it, but the Government is shackled, particularly by the environmental movement and the trade union movement. These shackles have not allowed it to move down pathways to give people an opportunity. So it has lost its vision. Of course, it is not only that. We recognise when we go out amongst the community and talk to people that the Government is perceived as being arrogant and out of touch, that it somehow does not understand where Australia is now at. I guess that is one of the consequences of not taking the really tough decisions throughout the last five or six years to bring about changes so that there could be real investment in Australia. It is a great tragedy that so many of our young people are now unemployed because of this Government's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the Australian clothing industry is improving its efficiency to meet overseas competition, it is a matter of serious concern that some operators are cutting the industry's throat by using low wage outworkers illegally and improperly. Australia's reputable clothing manufacturers are streamlining their operations, complying with the requirements of relevant State and Federal laws and employing workers in accordance with relevant industrial awards and safety provisions. They now face a growing threat from unscrupulous operators, not entrepreneurs, but despicable individuals who are importing Third World working conditions into this country and this industry via outworker arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of two Brisbane manufacturers and three Sydney manufacturers who are widely known in the industry to supply garments at prices we would expect to find in underdeveloped over-exploited countries. The use of outworkers or home workers is not a new phenomenon; however, it is a growing one. Union officials in this industry have successfully prosecuted unscrupulous producers in this field in New South Wales, recovering over $50,000 in unpaid wages in the last two years. One Brisbane firm, which has specialised in supplying Queensland sports clothes, claims to employ only two people for the entire operation-administration, manufacturing and sales. </PARA>
<PARA> A director of that firm, who claims to be one of the two employees, informed a Queensland industrial inspector that this was the case. What is more, I understand that the company has only one domestic sewing machine, yet it is able to fill orders for hundreds of tracksuits and other sportswear for various schools in Brisbane. What makes the claim even more interesting is the fact that everyone in the industry knows that you require between three and five industrial sewing machines to produce one commercial tracksuit. I am informed that this two-person team supplies approximately 13 south-east Queensland private schools with sports clothes, tracksuits, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to this director myself. The proposition that he makes a living by himself and his wife sewing away frantically-just the two of them-is an absurd and preposterous suggestion. It begs the question: just what sort of work practices, pay and safety conditions is this person so keen on keeping from public scrutiny? A Brisbane manufacturer recently wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that over the last 18 months we have gone from 95 employees to 55 employees and this situation could deteriorate if something is not done about the thousands, and I repeat thousands of home sewers manufacturing garments that would normally be sewn in legitimate factories. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are not covered by award wages, superannuation etc.. and are not subject to the many government regulations factories and businesses have to observe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the actual sewers that are at fault, but the companies . . . who use these people that should be prosecuted. In some cases these people have three or four machinists as a front but manufacture thousands of garments each week through their network of outworkers. </PARA>
<PARA>The fellow whom I previously mentioned is not even smart enough to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday evening in this place, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) once again demonstrated the thoughtful and compassionate nature that has earned him the nickname `Iron Bar'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was interested to hear the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) . . . painting the picture of the sweatshop-of somebody being locked away at home with a treadle sewing machine having to turn out 10,000 pieces of clothing a day to make two quid a day. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Has he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the honourable member for Newcastle-</PARA>
<PARA>ever been in a typical Australian family home recently? For instance, has he ever seen where the sewing machine might be? it seems to be out in that nice, sunny . . . room. </PARA>
<PARA>Then we come to the Opposition's real agenda in these matters, because he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe in giving them the encouragement, the incentives through voluntary agreements, to want to produce more and to produce it cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again the honourable member for O'Connor makes assertions and attacks other people without having the slightest idea of what is actually occurring in the industry. He and his ilk should think about the outworker in Sydney who was being used, or rather abused, by a manufacturer. This individual was working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. After an investigation by the union, an action is being brought against that operator. Had that woman been paid award rates, she would have received an additional $19,671 in pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The following cases involve workers in Victoria. In the first, a prosecution in a magistrates court was brought against the employer concerning underpayment of an outworker. The claim was settled by the payment of over $9,000 to the outworker. In the second case, an outworker made a claim against her former employer for various underpayments. This matter was settled with a payment of $15,000 to the outworker. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am talking about massive exploitation. Are they the sorts of voluntary agreements that the honourable member for O'Connor and the Opposition favour? The Industrial Relations Commission has made clear its view of this practice-and not surprisingly, it does not conform with the sort of view expressed by the honourable member for O'Connor and the Opposition. Deputy President Riordan, in a judgment on one such case in 1987, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The present system of work outside the award provisions represents a serious obstacle to the achievement of justice and equity in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence in this case of breaches and blatant evasion of the relevant award provisions, with the consequential unfair exploitation of the persons concerned, demands that the strongest possible protection be given to ensure compliance with the award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Forget about the breaches of the award and the lack of safety and superannuation entitlements-just as long as there is a ray of light filtering into the room. That is all that the honourable member for O'Connor and the Opposition seem to think that some Australian workers are entitled to. Fortunately, that view is not shared by most people in the industry. I am heartened by and pleased with the cooperation between responsible employers and unions involved in clothing manufacture. They are working together to build a competitive Australian clothing industry which we can be proud of, one in which workers share equitably in the profits of their labour, one in which they are able to enjoy a safe, clean work environment, and one which can compete successfully with imported clothing in both quality and price-an industry where the cancer of outwork is eradicated. I commend those employers and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth and State governments have a role and responsibility in this fight. It requires resources and it requires commitment. If we are to end illegal importation of Third World salaries and conditions, we must act, and act now, while we still have honest and reputable manufacturers left in the industry. As a first step, we should immediately withdraw the opportunity for unscrupulous employers to use the Australian made logo. The Buy Australian campaign is not just aimed at import replacement. It represents to consumers a symbol that the product has been made in Australia to a standard and under conditions regarded as satisfactory in our country. Clearly, in terms of wages, that means payment of relevant award rates and it does not mean sweatshop salary rates at one-quarter of the prevailing award rates. That is the cancer which is filtering through the clothing industry at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I found somewhat interesting the comments of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the Opposition member who spoke previously in the grievance debate, when he referred to industrial relations and the need for some change in the way in which industrial relations is structured in this country. Those on the Opposition benches promulgate a view that we should eliminate the Industrial Relations Commission from the process and allow the workers in their individual places of employment to negotiate with their employers regarding conditions of service. Anybody on either side who has been involved in industrial relations knows where the balance of power rests in that regard-it rests with the person who has the H.R. Nicholls Society, the big lawyers and the right to hire and fire on his side. The result would be a reduction in the living standards of Australian workers across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make clear my intention to pursue this matter further, to work with the industry and relevant Ministers and to see the culprits in this crime brought to account under the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address a range of problems currently facing the electorate of Isaacs as a result of the Hawke-Keating Government's lack of interest in middle Australia. I am aware that many other parts of Australia are experiencing similar problems and I am very conscious of the fact that the rural sector is currently experiencing severe hardship as a result of this Government's economic incompetence. However, during this afternoon's grievance debate I wish to restrict my comments to the damage being inflicted upon Australia's manufacturing industries and, in particular, the Moorabbin industrial estate and the Braeside industrial area within my electorate, which together comprise a substantial part of this nation's small manufacturing base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has consistently got it wrong. It has got it wrong because it relies on the Canberra bureaucrats for advice on subjects of which they have only a theoretical knowledge. The Government's whole approach to economics is based on theory, whereas I speak on behalf of those who have a practical and working knowledge of the crisis facing Australia and the manufacturing sector in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 November 1990, I indicated to the House that unemployment would rise and that the Government's statistics were understating the problem. I made this statement with the knowledge of what was happening in my electorate. On that same day, I asked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to visit the electorate of Isaacs and see for himself the damage that his Government's policies were causing. Once again, I invite the Treasurer to leave the cloisters of Canberra and visit my electorate. He should come and experience the real world of industry. He should come and witness the problems these businesses are having in keeping their doors open. The Treasurer should not delay, because the doors of industry are closing very quickly in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the approach of the Treasurer and this failed Government, there are no quick fix solutions to the current problems facing Australian industry. Yet the March industry statement by the Government is a perfect example of the fact that the Treasurer believes in the quick fix or bandaid approach. The Government's attitude to the removal of tariffs is proof that there is no commitment to substantial economic reform of our economy. To the contrary, the Government is telling Australian industry that tariff barriers are to be reduced and that the industry must either sink or swim within this context. In theory, this might appear an acceptable approach, but let me tell the House that those who are component suppliers to the automotive industry or those who are competing against imported products do not agree. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that there are benefits to be gained from the lowering of tariffs. It will encourage manufacturers and producers to stay at the leading edge of technology and competitiveness. But those advantages can only-I repeat only-be realised if we have a level playing field. To be of value, tariff reforms must be accompanied by significant micro-economic reform which hits at the real heart of the problems facing manufacturers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is willing to throw manufacturers to the wolves. It is prepared to take away the tariff barriers which allow them to compete without any signs that it will address the real issue requiring immediate attention-significant micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been arguing for a flat $12 increase for workers and for an increase in occupational superannuation-all at a time when unemployment is rising and when this Government is telling us that businesses need to improve their efficiency and become more competitive. In his industry statement the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government will continue to open up the manufacturing sector and Australian industry generally through lower protection. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that unless lower protection is accompanied by other reforms, they will not just open up the manufacturing sector, they will totally destroy it. </PARA>
<PARA> Support from the Government for the $12 increase, even though it was not successful, is proof that the Government is not serious about micro-economic reform. Industry is expected to launch itself into a new era, but this Government has entrenched itself in an arbitration system that should be dead and buried. </PARA>
<PARA> This week's pay increase should not be seen in isolation when we talk about the obstacles facing industry in this country. What about the increase in payroll tax? What about the increase in the trainee guarantee scheme contributions based on a percentage of payroll? What about WorkCare and other workers' compensation increases? What about increases in sales tax? What about increases in State and Federal government taxes on bank accounts? What about the effects of this pay increase on long service leave payments? What about the effect that this increase will have on holiday pay, with our unique 17.5 per cent loading? Finally, what about the inflationary impact that is felt throughout the entire economy? And all this at a time when unemployment is rising and businesses are struggling to hold their staff. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about a clever country; we are talking about a very silly government. It is a government that has a blind loyalty to its union mates; a government that cannot see that, by its very actions, or perhaps one should say inactions, it is making the task of manufacturing in this country a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have only dealt with wage increases and the Government's refusal to introduce reform to this area. But there are many other areas which require immediate attention and should be given priority in any worthwhile program of micro-economic reform. What about power? The fact is that in this country our manufacturers pay about 30 per cent more than our trading partners for power for production. On the waterfront, the average turnaround of ships is five days, compared with 12 hours in Hong Kong and five hours in Singapore. Yet the Prime Minister comes into this place and talks about our efficiency increases on the waterfront as a percentage. That is typical of the selective statistics that this Government uses to justify its arguments. These are good examples of the reforms required to create a level playing field that manufacturers need if they are to continue to survive this Government's tariff reduction program.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is constantly telling Australian industry that it is time for it to become more competitive, yet at the same time it allows the union movement to continue antiquated work practices which are strangling small business operators. Examples from my home State of Victoria in the public transport sector include the restrictive work practice that requires single skilled workers to carry out maintenance on Met trains. A union ban on using multiskilled employees means that it takes 20 people to carry out routine maintenance when it could be done with four employees. There are multiskill bans that mean that when matching holes are to be drilled in timber and steel, two tradesmen are required-one to drill in timber and one in steel. There is overstaffing on many railway stations where platform staff can often include one person to wave the train away, another to operate the public address system, a supervisor, a second supervisor, a first man, a second man and a third man, all with unspecified duties. I could go on and on with further examples-the list is endless. With those rorts in full swing this Government has the gall to tell Australian manufacturers to become more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the Government's position, the Opposition is working closely with industry to ensure that the coalition's policies will help, rather than hinder, Australian industry. The coalition parties will introduce a comprehensive and wide reaching program of economic reform in complete contrast to the Government's piecemeal approach. The coalition rejects the Government's bandaid solutions to Australia's economic woes, when what is required is major surgery. Further evidence of the coalition's approach to this important issue is detailed in the speech to the National Press Club on 6 March 1991 by the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . unlike the Government, we consider it would be unreasonable and unfair to expect industry to cope with further reductions in protection without accompanying comprehensive reforms in areas where inefficiencies increase production costs. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I wish to draw to the attention of the House a letter dated 30 June 1987 sent to business houses in the Isaacs electorate during the 1987 Federal election campaign. I was the Liberal candidate in the electorate of Isaacs at that time and I would like to quote from that letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I know that small business is the engine room of our economy. It employs the most people and has the greatest potential to generate jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by P.J. Keating, Treasurer. If it is good enough for the Treasurer to send such a letter of interest in business in the electorate of Isaacs during the 1987 election campaign, and to write letters on government letterhead at taxpayers' expense, it is reasonable to expect that the Treasurer would now display some interest in, and concern for, the well-being and condition of industry and small business within the electorate of Isaacs and throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to report to the House that I received a letter from the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) on 22 March 1991, expressing concern over the Government's proposed banning of political advertising. I want to canvass that issue in the next couple of minutes. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am writing to express our Association's deep concern over the proposal to impose a complete and permanent ban on so-called political advertising in the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Federal Secretariat of the State and Territory motoring organisations, AAA is responsible for representing the interests of their 5.2 million members and, indirectly, all Australian motorists at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to fulfil this role, our Association has occasionally had to resort to paid advertising to ensure that motoring consumers are aware of issues affecting them. </PARA>
<PARA>I was at the receiving end in the last Federal election of some of the paid advertisements which the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland ran against the Government at that time. I do not deny its right to advertise its points of view, of course, but I was not at all pleased with the views which it purported to be the truth and on which it spent a great deal of money to issue to the electors of Petrie. Mind you, it did it no good whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Automobile Association-supposedly representing the interests of five million members-says that it wants freedom of speech, then it ought to know that freedom of speech costs about $13,000 a minute on television. It is not free. The issue for the Australian Automobile Association is: why can it-a powerful, wealthy organisation-put a particular point of view across but others cannot? That is the issue that I want to address. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the automobile associations are basically a lobby for the car industry, oil and rubber industry and the road-building industry, and that position is well known. A risk is being run in this country where large and powerful organisations with a particular viewpoint can be heard much more readily than those organisations that do not have the money to pay $13,000 a minute for television advertising. It is that sort of proposition which the Australian Labor Party is going to address during this debate on the banning or otherwise of paid political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Automobile Association and those who wish more roads to be built in Australia have done very well indeed. In 1981-82, the Federal Government spent $685m on land transport funding, a very minor proportion of which was spent on rail funding. By 1990-91, we were spending $1,610m on roads. The great jump in that expenditure, of course, arose in the 1983-84 Budget, where spending rose from $850m to $1,195m. This was a consequence, of course, of the stimulus given by the previous Liberal Government through the bicentennial road development program which was introduced on Budget night of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not dispute the fact that most of the taxation on petrol and the car industry would easily cover the amount spent on roads. But when organisations like AAA enter the fray, they inevitably put a very biased point of view and that can lead to sufficient pressure on governments to distort government funding. We do not hear the other side of the argument. The Federal Government is at pains to get people to understand that we prefer everyone to have a shot at election time at making their views known, not only those who are able to pay for those views to be expressed through paid advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative side of the argument, which AAA would never have put and would never congratulate the Federal Government on, of course, is that if one increases expenditure on road funding one does not always get a better drive; one does not always look after one's five million members. In a recent report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council entitled Urban and Regional Trends and Issues-this is nothing new, but EPAC has done some work on policies to deal with traffic congestion which I use as an example here-it says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . increased provision of roads does not always lead to reduced traffic congestion and accident costs. United States experience shows that it can lead to:</PARA>

<PARA> The United States electoral system has been totally corrupted because it does not have our system of party solidarity which gives protection to the individual member. The United States has an electoral system whereby individual members of the House of Representatives or senators have their campaigns paid for by large interests such as automobile associations, et cetera. We have a system that enables us to make reasonable decisions without undue influence by a large group of people who have sufficient money to pay for significant amounts of political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a good comment by Claude Forell in the Age yesterday, 17 April 1991, headed: `Manipulation is the message'. He commented:</PARA>
<PARA>Political advertising is something the Labor Party can't afford, the Liberals and Nationals don't need, and the public doesn't want. And no matter how clever or vivid, it isn't going to alter the outcome of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a brutally honest assessment of some of the rationale for introducing this ban on political advertising and Claude Forell, I think, is absolutely correct. But he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Let's not be kidded that this involves some lofty principle of freedom of speech. As veteran adman Phillip Adams has put it, political advertising has as much to do with free speech as graffiti on a dunny wall. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Phillip Adams, as nearly always, is absolutely correct on this one. </PARA>
<PARA> All three major political parties understand now that the cost of putting political ads to air is getting beyond them and that the danger of being induced into taking money from various organisations in order to pay for those ads is just too great. Too great an influence may be brought to bear on any political party in this country if a ceiling is not somehow put on the amount of money that can be spent. It seems to me that Britain, where paid political advertising has been banned since World War II, has coped exceptionally well with freedom of speech and with decent political debate without people having undue influence by spending large amounts of money on political advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Australian Automobile Association that I do not support its particular views about road funding and I really do not care if it never again places another political advertisement. It will have to fight in the political arena as we do to put our point of view to the Australian public and the public shall decide what is right and what is wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the grievance debate to address a subject which this Government has failed to come to grips with since coming to government eight years ago. The subject is the kangaroo industry and quotas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The humble Australian kangaroo is potentially worth a potential fortune in terms of export income if this Government can see commonsense. The industry is a very emotive issue with very little commonsense prevailing from the arguments of Greenpeace and animal liberationists. The kangaroo population is currently 10 times its natural level-in other words, 10 times the level when Captain Cook arrived in Australia. Since 1984 the total numbers in a land study across 2.5 million square kilometres of New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland have grown from about nine million to 14 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Man has pandered to the needs of the kangaroos, creating a perfect environment for their survival and, indeed, prosperity by spreading water across lands where there was never any natural water. It is scientifically recognised that their numbers need to be controlled for the preservation of plant and animal systems. By controlling numbers, we not only protect ecological systems but also provide a basis for earning valuable export dollars and creating a domestic industry to serve local and international markets. The animal welfare lobby, a small group, has clouded the issue, seeing a complicated situation from a single perspective. The value of the kangaroo as a natural resource must be recognised by this Government to avert a potential $150m industry rotting in the paddock. </PARA>
<PARA> A major barrier to servicing the potentially huge export market for kangaroo and kangaroo products is the Federal Government's annual procrastination in accepting kangaroo management programs. The 1991 management program is yet to be announced. We find ourselves in the middle of April and the Federal Government is still failing to renew export licences or agree to an established kangaroo quota. </PARA>
<PARA> This program, subject to only minor alterations, has been put before the Government for the past eight years. Yet it still takes three to four months before the management program, which has scientific support, gains ministerial approval. As a result of the Government's inaction, the industry loses millions of dollars in export revenue and lost jobs. I can assure the House that there are many people in towns in my electorate desperate for those jobs and desperate to see the kangaroo industry revitalised. </PARA>
<PARA> If such poor decision making were to occur in private enterprise, the offending party would be sacked-and I say, sack the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The Government's inability to hand down the management program for the year it applies to is costing and infuriating the industry. In effect, the Government is stagnating an industry at a time when Australia is in desperate need of every possible export earning dollar. The lack of stability and predictability promoted by the Government in the kangaroo industry provides no incentive for the industry's growth. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would be prepared to invest substantial sums of money under such uncertain conditions. For the industry to become serious, an alternative to annual announcements of the kangaroo management program must be considered urgently. The Government must ensure to the industry stability of product. A management program reassessed every five years would ensure such stability and make commonsense. The five-year period would still allow for finetuning in unpredictable times, including drought. </PARA>
<PARA> Land degradation is scientifically recognised as the nation's single worst environmental problem. The area classified by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation as severely degraded is larger than Queensland. Kangaroos, it is scientifically documented, contribute significantly to this land degradation problem. They graze closer to the ground than sheep and, in drought, can destroy vegetation completely. Even light kangaroo grazing pressure can cause vegetation changes in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that kangaroos caused $148m worth of damage to the agricultural sector alone back in 1983-84 and, of course, today's figures would be much higher than that. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics updated those figures and established that each kangaroo effectively caused $3.72 worth of damage, a cost to the average Australian property of $1,364 a year. Back in 1983-84 kangaroos cost the average farmer in the wheat/sheep zone $1,441, which equates to $11.26 per kangaroo and, of course, this would be much higher today. Kangaroos also caused $2,073 worth of damage to the average pastoral property. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised by researchers and scientists alike that population estimates done to date grossly underestimate kangaroo numbers. Last year the commercial culling quota was set at approximately 4 million kangaroos. Therefore, a conservative estimate puts the kangaroo population at 14 million head in Australia. The harvesting of one in 10 kangaroos would maintain population levels at current rates. Harvesting one in 15 would have no impact and kangaroo numbers would in fact increase. The quotas are conservatively set and are in no way wiping out kangaroo populations. Scientific evidence shows that the numbers are being maintained at current levels. The quotas are responsible measures arrived at by professionals for the well-being of Australia's environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for Australia to recognise the value of the kangaroo as a natural resource. If this recognition does not come about, we will be indulging in huge levels of waste. Kangaroo numbers must be controlled and to promote the end product only makes commercial sense. Eighty per cent of our kangaroo skins are exported. The export of kangaroo hide, skin and leather was worth $13m in 1988-89, even with the Government's stop start policy. This valuable industry has the potential to be even more valuable. As I have said, we have to control kangaroos because of the damage they do. A greater number of tanning facilities in Australia could improve the value of the export by at least threefold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would provide employment, as the honourable member says.hhThe promotion of tanning and processing plants across Australia has the potential to attract a valuable industry to remote Australia and, in turn, help maintain rural infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that if those who arrived with the First Fleet had been prepared to live off the land rather than bring their livestock with them, kangaroos by now would be the basis of an established meat and hide export industry, perhaps rivalling the beef industry in importance. Kangaroo is a fat-free red meat, not unlike venison to taste. In game meat terms, this industry would be worth $80m. In effect, this $80m is being left in the paddock to rot. More has to be done to promote kangaroo as a gourmet delicacy. It is a natural resource of Australia. Misplaced Greenpeace ethics should be kept out of the debate. If it is unethical to make money out of a native animal, it is surely unethical to elect an animal as the national symbol, shoot it as a pest and feed it to the dogs. That is what is happening. Kangaroo numbers must be controlled, so why do we waste this unique Australian resource?</PARA>
<PARA> For an industry to be internationally marketable there must exist some stability and predictability. No-one would be prepared to invest money if there were no guarantee of returns. The kangaroo industry is potentially huge, yet after 200 years it is still in its infancy. It will never progress from its infancy with a government that cannot hand down a management report in time for the year it applies. Whatever the by-product, the kangaroo industry will never amount to anything serious with a government pandering to the irrational, scientifically unsound and emotive pleas of a minority lobby group. The result is a huge waste on a huge scale which should not be tolerated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is, of course, a relatively young country. Indeed, in Western Australia, where I come from, it is only just beyond 160 years since the first colony was developed. During early colonisation a large number of significant buildings were established. It is much to our chagrin that many of these have been destroyed in recent times. The most recent controversy in Western Australia that really hit the headlines concerned Barracks Arch and the fact that at the end of St Georges Terrace, that arch stands alone; none of the surrounding buildings are still with us, which is something we should lament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is of concern to me that another of our historic buildings, indeed two or three others within the precinct of my electorate, has come under scrutiny recently. I speak particularly about the old Swan brewery, which has been a symbol and focal point on the Swan River for more than 90 years. The original building was constructed in 1897. It has been, I suppose, a central focus of the Swan River. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who visited Perth would have recognised the Swan Brewery building situated on the river foreshore. It is a building of former glory but presently the site of great controversy. I first wrote to the newspaper about this issue a couple of years ago and was involved in the imbroglio around it. Since that time there have been established some coalitions of interest in respect of this. There is a group of people whose view is that we should knock this building down. The State Government, much to its credit, has steadfastly held to the view that it should be developed as a community resource and as a building of great significance which will provide an ongoing legacy to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments to knock it down are quite numerous and in fact hardly coincidental. Many of them push in different directions. Those who wish to knock it down say that this building has failed to be listed by the National Trust. If one speaks to the National Trust about it, it says it has had difficulty establishing the age and indeed the historical significance of particular parts of the building because the Swan Brewery developed over a number of years by a dynamic process. The argument that has precluded the National Trust from listing the building is not one which suggests that this building should be knocked down. What is required is an objective study of the building and a study of its significance. </PARA>
<PARA> A small lobby group of Aboriginals has fought very hard to have the building knocked over. Its view is that the Swan River site, where the building is, is part of the mythical resting place of the Wagyl. The Senior report established many years ago noted that in fact there was no particular Aboriginal significance to this site. Whatever balance one wants to put on the evidence about this particular issue, it is clear that there is considerable discord amongst Aboriginal groups as to the significance of the site. Some say that the most significant sites are further down the river, others that the sacred site is in the other direction or towards Kings Park. There are differences of opinion within the Aboriginal groups. It is a source of concern to me that this particular aspect of Aboriginal relations has received such prominence. </PARA>
<PARA> I put a question on notice to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) as to the percentage of Aboriginal Legal Service funds that have been spent on the particular court case regarding the Swan Brewery. As yet I am not satisfied by the answer because it is clear to me that many Aboriginals are unable to be defended in court because of lack of funds from the Service. I would like to know how the priorities are established in respect of funds which are made available from the Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a group which believes that there should be no developments around the Swan River, that we should establish a green belt and access should be limited. Western Australia is very fortunate to have some of the best parks and gardens in any city anywhere in the world. There is a lack of facilities for people using the river and enjoying the benefits of that great natural resource. They do not have access to public toilets, places where they can eat and drink or the normal amenities that one would expect. Cyclists, walkers, joggers, tourists and people who use the water all understand the need for some facilities around the river. Indeed, one could hardly say that the Swan River was an area which was overdeveloped in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA> There are others who argue that its position and the shape that the road needs to take present traffic hazards. The State Government has dealt with this issue. A road divider has been provided. The angle and shape of the road have been changed. Are they suggesting that the building be knocked down and that this Aboriginal site, which is so important, should be where the new road takes its place? I do not accept that this argument carries weight. Those who put the argument about the sacred site should realise that the road which passes next to the brewery building surely must be travelling across sacred territory also. Is there a suggestion that the road should be removed? All of these arguments are fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst intellectual argument is the suggestion that because the building looks terrible now, we should knock it down. Not so long ago a similar view was put in respect of a building in Fremantle. Because of the activity and the action of the local council, the Fremantle Arts Centre and Museum building is now one of the most significant buildings in the Fremantle area. That building was in disrepair and in need of refurbishing and refreshment. A breath of life from a local council brought about a change which sees that building as significant and important. </PARA>
<PARA> What needs to be understood is that the old Swan Brewery building is a symbolic building and has been for all of this century an important landmark on the Swan River foreshore. It has particular architectural, historical and industrial significance to development in Western Australia. Aesthetically it is a pleasing building and one needs to look at it as it can be, not as it is at the moment. The argument that it looks dilapidated at the moment, therefore it should be knocked down is, in my view, one of great intellectual poverty. We need to understand that in our country, which is relatively young, there are precious few historical buildings and buildings of significance. It is absolutely important that, when the Western Australian Heritage Council meets to discuss this issue objectively, it thinks very hard about it. Any decision to demolish this building will be fought. </PARA>

I have been seeking the call in adjournment debates all this week in order to make a speech on this, but I have not managed to get the call. This article highlights the concerns that I was going to express. Australia is the only country of the 151 members of the organisation that has withdrawn. We withdrew two years ago and we are now losing, or have the potential to lose, millions of dollars because this is the organisation that organises a lot of the relief works. A lot of the rebuilding work in the Middle East will go through this organisation, and our businesses are going to miss out because we are no longer a member of this organisation. It will cost us $1.4m to rejoin; from that, Australian business will have the opportunity to participate in millions and millions of dollars worth of industry. So I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to accelerate Australia's rejoining this important United Nations agency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has chosen to rubbish publicly a witness, Senator Paul McLean, who appeared before the Committee in relation to its inquiry into the banking system. The success of the parliamentary committee system depends largely on witnesses freely appearing before it without fear of harassment or public denigration. Senator McLean has spent some 2 1/2 years of research on inequities in the Australian banking system and has presented some 3,000 pages of evidence. This material could not have been properly considered by the Chairman prior to his regrettable statement. It was not even available to members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Chairman's premature and dismissive remarks have now resulted in public doubts as to the integrity of the inquiry. Whether the Chairman's remarks turn out in the end to be correct or not is irrelevant; his action was a petty party political statement designed to gain maximum media exposure. The credibility of the inquiry has now been damaged and proper consideration of the material submitted by Senator McLean has been pre-empted. The recent attempt by the Labor, Liberal and National parties to prevent public examination and debate on the Westpac letters, in spite of the efforts by Senator McLean and others, was disgraceful.

However, thousands of businesses have gone to the wall because the policy framework of this Government has not been right. I will give just one example. The Seymour abattoirs has been closed and empty since last October after years of industrial turmoil. The only possible way that this abattoirs can reopen as a commercially viable enterprise is for private enterprise to use its initiative to reopen it by using contract labour paid on a productivity basis. It is vital that this happen in order to improve our export meat industry and to provide employment. The reopening of the Seymour abattoirs will give this Government a lead into establishing the right policy framework in order to meet those economic challenges the Prime Minister referred to.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all won, of course. It saw the retirement from the City of Ipswich of Des Freeman as our long-serving Mayor after 12 years. Previously, he was an alderman of the Council and, of course, was a coalminer for many years. Together, Des and his wife, Colleen, worked extremely hard for the City of Ipswich and continue to do so. I would like to put on record my sincere thanks and best wishes to Des and Colleen Freeman for their great effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the election saw the return of another Labor Ipswich City Council, led by Alderman Dave Underwood and his team. Of the 10 divisions in the Council, nine were won by Labor. All three Liberal opponents were wiped out. I extend my congratulations to Paul Pisasale, Denise Hanly and Wayne McDonnell, who actually took those seats from the Liberal Party. It leaves only one Independent out of the 10. Even the Australian Labor Party candidate in that seat, Rosanne Browne-Mafi, received a 13 per cent swing, and I offer my congratulations to her as well. So, effectively, Ipswich now has no elected representatives from the Liberal or National parties; it is now a Tory-free town. </PARA>

Recently, we saw the defeat of Sallyanne Atkinson in the lord mayoral race in Brisbane by one of the bastions of that lily-white ALP. I speak of `gentleman Jim' Soorley, the retired Jesuit, who has indulged in political grandstanding in recent days about his lord mayoral salary and allowance reductions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the House a very important project currently under way in Queensland, which has implications for all women in Australia. It is, of course, the creation of Women's Place, which is an attempt to establish a national museum to acknowledge the contribution of women to Australian history and to get together all the collections that currently exist. As honourable members will appreciate, there are many small towns throughout Australia whose Country Women's Associations, other church women's groups and a whole range of other women's organisations have a number of collections of material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note at this time that collections are being put together of photographs of women in the union movement, of women in political parties and all other things. It seems an important time, now that women represent 53 per cent of the population, to acknowledge the contributions of women to our fine country and of the work that they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw to the attention of the House that one of the contributions to the collection is a very large portrait of Emma Jordan, who founded the Labor women's movement 100 years ago. Her first speech highlighted the needs of women in the area of child-care, education and equal pay. It seems that those of us who are here today must keep on with her fight and her struggle to ensure that women are treated fairly, equally and with dignity and are, of course, given every opportunity. So it is with great pleasure that I seek the support of the House for such a noble project. </PARA>

<PARA> Yesterday I was asked this question by the honourable member for Bennelong and I made the situation quite clear. He asked me whether I had received an approach from the then Western Australian Premier, Brian Burke, to urge the National Australia Bank Ltd to rescue Rothwells. That was yesterday's ploy. I responded to that and said that Burke was never in touch with me. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>An approach was made to me concerning Rothwells' difficulties with the National Australia Bank. It was made by the late Mr Beckwith of Bond Corporation. The essence of the approach was for me to interest myself in the apparent difficulties of a merchant bank-Rothwells-over difficulties it was having in its ongoing financial relationship with the National Australia Bank. I was asked to approach the National Australia Bank in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I have already told the House the answer to the second question the Leader of the Opposition put to me today. My answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This I did not do, but my office did inquire of the Reserve Bank whether it was aware that Rothwells may have ongoing difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> As it turned out, the Reserve Bank had already been in contact . . . Accordingly, the matter was taken no further by me or my office.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the position. I got a call from Mr Beckwith late on the evening of Thursday, 22 October, I think it was, or early on the 23rd. My office was in touch with the Reserve Bank mid-morning on 23 October. Over that weekend, the 24th and the 25th, the rescue of Rothwells was put together. But I was asked whether I would interest myself in the affairs of a merchant bank. It was put to me that this was the first financial institution in difficulties after the stock market crash and that therefore I should interest myself in its affairs because apparently the National Australia Bank would not clear a cheque of Rothwells. I was asked to speak to the National Australia Bank. This I did not do. I inquired of the Reserve Bank whether it knew of Rothwells' difficulties. It did; it had already had a number of conversations with the National Australia Bank. I then heard from both the bank and the Treasury on the 23rd about the difficulties Rothwells was having with the National Australia Bank.</PARA>
<PARA> A package was put together for Rothwells over the weekend of 24 and 25 October 1987. The rescue package involved support from a number of Australian businesses and a $150m guarantee from the Western Australian State Government for bills issued by the National Australia Bank. There were 16 of those institutions: Kerry Packer, Alan Bond, Robert Holmes a Court, Ron Brierley, Larry Adler, Dallas Dempster, Allan Hawkins, John Elliott, John Roberts, John Dunoon, Brent Potts, Sir Tristan Antico, Bill Hughes, Paul Morgan, and Suncorp, the Queensland Government insurance authority. The package was put together by Wardley Australia. That occurred over that weekend.</PARA>
<PARA> I can only say what I said when I was asked about this issue by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong, on the Monday morning, the same morning the rescue package was announced. I said that neither I, nor the Treasury, the Reserve Bank or my office knew of the rescue package before it was announced. I am saying that now. The honourable member for Kooyong said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I refer him to reports this morning that part of the rescue package to save Rothwells Ltd comprises a loan from a bank backed by Western Australia's Labor Government. Will the Treasurer clarify . . . to what extent is the Commonwealth Government acting as an implicit guarantor . . .</PARA>
<PARA>My answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not familiar with all the details of Rothwells' financing or its structure, apart from what I have read in the newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA>That I answered on the day that the Rothwells package was actually announced. Let me repeat: neither I, nor the Treasury, the Reserve Bank or my office knew of the rescue package before it was announced. I was not approached by the then Western Australian Premier, Mr Burke, about the rescue package, nor did I approach him, directly or indirectly.</PARA>
<PARA> What is very amusing about this is that Mr Howard was very complimentary of the rescue. On 26 October 1987, that same day, he said at the front door of Parliament House:</PARA>
<PARA>The only comment I would make is that it is an admirable example of the capitalist system acting responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA>The questioner said:</PARA>
<PARA>But does the Rothwells matter indicate that some of the more recent merchant banks are fairly fragile-they have arisen so quickly?</PARA>
<PARA>Howard:</PARA>
<PARA>No, I don't believe it does. I think what it does indicate is an admirable willingness on the part of the leading corporate figure to act responsibly in a difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA>He was very laudatory of the package. But not only was he laudatory of it. I was saying that I saw no need for the Government to be involved. He thought there was a role for someone to be involved, particularly the private sector.</PARA>

<PARA>In the State Parliament late yesterday the Premier, Mr Burke, claimed Mr Howard had supported the State Government's role.</PARA>

<PARA>The Federal Government had not been asked to help Rothwells and Mr Burke had not discussed the issue with the Treasurer, Mr Keating.</PARA>

He said Mr Howard had told people he had made clear his attitude to Mr MacKinnon. But Mr MacKinnon insisted this was not true. He said Mr Howard had not pressured him, nor had he given an opinion about the package.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that obviously we do not expect Mr MacKinnon to put in the honourable member for Bennelong; but Burke would know who helped him with the matter, and Burke said that he helped. This is the same person who lauded the package. He went on to say:</PARA>

God, they have got some front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen this onslaught against the integrity of the Prime Minister, an onslaught that has now been brushed away by the facts. Those opposite are now back to the rescue of Rothwells in 1987, trying to inveigle the Government, when we have stated very clearly where we stand. I gave another answer to then Senator Chaney through Senator Walsh, which I will not bore the House by reading, that only further corroborates my position.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is supposed to be about finding a new agenda for Australia. The picture is of a Leader of the Opposition with a thoughtful, moderate and sober demeanour. We thought over here that he was just thinking; we now find out that for the last 12 months he was just vacant. He has been sitting over there vacant. What we thought was a moderate, sober demeanour from a leader thinking about a new agenda-it boils down to this-was really dead ordinary and vacant.</PARA>
<PARA> When push comes to shove, he is just like every other common or garden Liberal: he is up into the mud slinging. Instead of a `visiting professor', he is a `visiting mud slinging professor'. That distinguishes him from the honourable member for Berowra, who is an ordinary common or garden Liberal professor. This is a `visiting mud slinging professor'. That is the best he can do. He got into the Prime Minister. We found that Senator Chaney had his hand out for the money. He was over there seeing Bond to get a contribution to the Liberal Party. He then saw Connell, and Connell gave him the money. That went into the Liberal Party's accounts, and never turned up in the declaration, of course.</PARA>
<PARA> Where has the mud slinging got them? Nowhere. At least they have peeled away the myth of the honourable member for Wentworth being some new bloke on the block they grabbed from a merchant bank and shoved into public life without all the baggage of political partisanship. He was going to think about a new agenda for Australia. We now realise that he has no thoughts about a new agenda for Australia; he is just hanging around for a bit of dirt, like all the others before him. This very shabby episode reflects absolutely poorly on the lot of you.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those reports appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald and elsewhere. I will go through the voluntary fundraising code that is referred to, said by the then Leader of the Opposition to be applicable in the 1987 election. He was very specific. The code states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>You never have any bank accounts over which you have control.</PARA>
<PARA>You do not have any leaders' accounts and you do not control money.</PARA>
<PARA>That is rule one. Rule two:</PARA>
<PARA>You do not involve yourself in collecting money. You do not ask people to give you cheques or accept cheques even to pass on to other people. Rule three.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst obviously you will occasionally go to functions which involve people who are current or prospective party supporters, you must be careful not to be in any way directly involved in the raising of money.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally:</PARA>
<PARA>You avoid, except to the extent that it is impossible not to have a general idea who one's supporters are or may be, knowing details of who has supported you, to what extent and with what regularity they help.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Liberal Party's fundraising code. Mr Seccombe records that when he attempted to get this public document he was told it was private. When it was eventually revealed that it was in his hands, the Liberal Party Federal Director rang him back and confirmed it. He then went on to say that it was unusual that Fred had gone out soliciting himself, in regard to the honourable member for Pearce, but that was not technically a breach of the guidelines. I hope Mr Robb never has to be in a position where he defends me in court if those are the grounds on which he will raise whether or not there is a technical breach of the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of notable things about what Mr Robb has had to say about fundraising. First, there is his attempt to distance himself from the Liberal Party, from the actions of the then Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, and maintain that this was unusual, that this was separate from the sort of thing the Liberal Party does, that we do not do that with any regularity and that, by implication, it was something on his own initiative. The second feature is the assumption that everything else that is done in fundraising conforms as far as that code is concerned. Of course, that is not true.</PARA>

<PARA>This is not just an odd fundraising dinner where one pays $100 a plate and everyone goes along to hear a politician sing, with which we are all familiar. This 500 Club had these characteristics when investigated by Four Corners a couple of years ago. The Four Corners correspondent said:</PARA>
<PARA>Here's one way you join the 500 Club. Conveniently, it's based right here at Liberal Party Melbourne headquarters. Party boss and Elders' chief John Elliott conceived the scheme. You sign up 500 corporate sympathisers.</PARA>

<PARA>The fact of the matter is that he does not know whether it was used for those purposes or otherwise.

<PARA> There is no question about it-I conclude on this-as far as disclosure is concerned, the Liberal Party is running around the place like a chook with its head cut off. It knows very well that any particular promise to go down this road will stand on its head the fabric of the way in which the Liberals have conducted business as a political party for years. We have no better authority on that than an article which appeared in the Adelaide newspaper by David Barnett, a journalist close to Liberal Party sources. When asked what was going on and why the Liberals had committed themselves to it, they said that the reason why the Liberal Party came down in support of the Government's disclosure of legislation was this:</PARA>
<PARA>Sources said this was because they were stung by Prime Minister Bob Hawke's taunts in Parliament and they knew the legislation would go through anyway with Democrat backing.</PARA>
<PARA>Also, Dr Hewson had given an immediate favourable response to the announcement and the coalition felt it had to back him. We decided to make the best of it.</PARA>

Rothwells apparently wanted the National Australia Bank to meet its cheques-that is, to extend it more credit-and, as it turned out, the National Australia Bank was not of a mind to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The coal industry has decided to put its best face forward-the face of coal, as it is our largest export industry. Eric put his face forward too, and it was a very nice face. The coal industry has worked out that if it does not blow its own trumpet, someone will come and pluck the strings out of its harp. Coal is now our premier export industry. Its earnings for 1991-92 are forecast to be of the order of $6.3 billion, which is about a 5 per cent increase on the previous year. This industry employs around 30,000 people, depending on what the multiplier is, which is vitally important for regions such as the Hunter Valley. Our export performance is now about 100 million tonnes. The estimates are that we should get to 150 million tonnes by the year 2005.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In keeping with the coal industry's promotion of National Coal Week this week, I think it is appropriate that members from the various coal seats in this Parliament give recognition to this great industry, because it is characterised by very strong and experienced companies. It now has a work force with some outstanding leaders. It has a long tradition of market development, high levels of capital investment and efficient technology and, perhaps surprisingly to those who do not understand the industry, a commitment to environmental excellence. I instance Coal and Allied Industries Ltd's Hunter No. 1 mine in the Hunter Valley, which received the inaugural award for environmental excellence for mine site rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Coal Week, to which the honourable member referred, was organised by the Australian Coal Association; he was there, as was the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the New South Wales shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Rogan, and many other local people. The objective of this week is to bring home to the Australian people the importance of the contribution that coal makes to the total quality of life of us all. By educating, informing and challenging the Australian people the organisers are trying to get us to think about coal. I think we should all endorse those objectives.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to get a legitimate question on fishing. The honourable gentleman takes a very close interest in it. It is very complex; last year when we were negotiating access to tuna resources with Japan, understandings were reached whereby the Australian and Japanese industries would work together to catch southern bluefin tuna by long-lining. The idea was to generate an Australian industry that could successfully participate in the most valuable part of the raw fish, or sashimi, markets in Japan, and at the same time we were catching larger fish, as long-lining does, which is better for the stock in the long run. This method of fishing requires rather specialist techniques and equipment, and we made significant efforts to encourage cooperation between the two industries. The transfer of expertise and technology from Japan to Australia is vital if we are to proceed down this path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the concept hit a whole heap of problems. It was hoped to have as many as 24 Australian-flag boats operating under the scheme in 1991, but we are now looking at perhaps only three. The remaining tuna quota that was set aside for these operations in 1991 will probably again have to be caught by joint ventures. The main problems have been at the Japanese end of the deal, with neither the Japanese industry nor Government being able to fulfil, at least at this stage, the undertakings that were given last year. I have taken this issue up with my counterpart in Japan, the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and intend to discuss it further at the Australia-Japan Ministerial Council meeting in May.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, through the Japanese side being unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, the Australian industry has been placed in a most difficult situation-one for which it must take some share of the blame itself. It set aside a large portion of its tuna quota to fish in the cooperative long-lining ventures with Japan, and when things did not progress the Australian industry had no alternative but to seek permission from me to catch the fish using the timeworn joint venture approach-again with Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not happy with this lack of progress, it is clearly unreasonable for me in the circumstances to refuse the Australian industry the opportunity to catch its quota this year. I thank the honourable member for the case that he has been putting forward on behalf of the Australian industry. I will approach other Commonwealth and State Ministers who have an interest in this matter in the near future, outlining the precise arrangements. I am only agreeing to this in principle in the short term. It is just an interim arrangement and we hope to get this matter all resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> Just one last point: the Government caught two vessels in a similar joint venture doing the wrong thing. As a result, we ended up owning one of the vessels and gaining substantial fines from the other. The level of monitoring and surveillance of this venture is going to be higher again than last year, with all costs being met by the joint venturers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the economic rationale for levelling the tax playing field through the removal of tax concessions, and what are the Government's intentions in this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2973" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rationale is that national resources savings, scarce national savings, go to the most productive places in the economy. The notion of a flat field is a notion of a flat field at home. None of us believes that there is a flat field abroad, but if we are in the position where we are not placing our resources in the best places in our own domestic economy, then of course we are doing ourselves a disservice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tariff preference and tax preference, which have otherwise dragged national savings from one place to another, and put them in places which have not optimised investment in Australia, have been part of our problem over the last 30 or 40 years. That is why we removed, amongst other things, the exemption on goldmining income. It was taking investment into goldmining where it might otherwise have been in national terms more optimal, optimising, in other parts of the economy. That is why the Government removed the gold tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> But the fact of the matter is that this has been a big issue in Australian public life. If we go back to 1985 when the honourable member for Bennelong was leader of the Liberal Party, we find the Kalgoorlie Miner saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Liberal tax threat stuns gold men. The goldmining industry has been stunned by shadow Treasurer John Howard's statement that the next Liberal Government will consider introducing a tax on gold. The President of the Kalgoorlie South division of the Liberal Party, Mr Krepp, dismissed Mr Howard's comments which run against current Party policy. `Mr Howard has a crack at the industry every year', Krepp said. ` It is . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Krepp says:</PARA>
<PARA>`It is his hardy annual. Every time he meets members of the other mining industries he tells them that a gold tax would be considered'.</PARA>
<PARA>This is part of the ambience of the time. Then there is another report in the West Australian in August 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Liberal Party is in a quandary over the Liberal Party's policy on the gold tax. The State Liberal leader, Mr Hassell, has fought strongly against the Hawke Government's proposed gold tax. He is worried by the possibility that his Party would introduce a gold tax. Yesterday he asked the Federal Liberal leader, Mr Peacock, to explain fully remarks made by his Party spokesman on treasury matters, Mr Howard. Mr Howard is reported to have said that he could not guarantee that a future Liberal government would not introduce a gold tax. `I strongly urge that such uncertainty be clarified', said Hassell.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in the same paper on 10 August 1985, two days later, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, yesterday reaffirmed the Party's commitment not to introduce a gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>So here he is-two days earlier we have Hassell having a go at him, two days later Peacock has moved straight back into line; he has reaffirmed there will be no gold tax. The statement stems from a plea for the clarification by the WA Opposition Leader, Mr Hassell. The WA branch of the Party was left in a quandary over the Federal Party's policy after Mr Howard had said what he had to say. Then, in the Australian:</PARA>
<PARA>Peacock reaffirms Party's opposition to a gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is on the same day, 10 August. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>`It is now clear for all to see that the Federal Liberal Party's policy is in line with my views on the matter', said Hassell.</PARA>
<PARA>We then jump two years to the lovely Senator Panizza-who apparently is in the gallery today although I do not know him, so I cannot recognise him. But he had this to say in his maiden speech:</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to thank the Liberal Party of Western Australia for the opportunity for me to realise the ambition I have had since I was a 20-year-old to be elected to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, the honourable senator has come in to hear what we say about them. We have, these days, a lot to say about them-particularly Western Australian senators. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>At that election the Western Australian team consisted of Durack, Senator Chaney, Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Knowles, Dr Alan Eggleston and young Cam Tingley and me.</PARA>
<PARA>This was obviously called the gold ticket. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I am an old boy of the college in Perth, the Aquinas, which has turned out many good politicians. There were three old boys in the Liberal Senate team-Chaney, Durack and me.</PARA>
<PARA>Also the lovely Laurie Connell went to this school, so I am told. Then he goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>There have been noises in this place and others that a gold tax should be--</PARA>

<PARA>There have been noises in this place and others that a gold tax should be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>But listen to this one:</PARA>
<PARA>No one would dare impose such a tax.</PARA>
<PARA>So says Senator Panizza. Then there is another article, headed `All that Glitters'.</PARA>
<PARA>`Are we killing the goose that has been laying a very valuable egg', Senator John Panizza asked today.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, but laying the egg for whom? Obviously not the nation-only the people from whom those opposite received election funding. In the last adjournment debate for 1990 the honourable senator drew attention to the state of the gold industry in Australia. Then we find that the debate goes on into 1988, and by then what has happened is that Mr Peacock has gone, Mr Howard is leader-the honourable member for Bennelong-and the Federal Opposition, it is reported:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will fight the Government's plan for a gold tax despite leader John Howard's recent support for it on economic grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>We start seeing it come through then. Then there is a question put to the then Senator Chaney by Michael Maher-I am not sure of the reference-on The World Today, 9 November 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Was Mr Howard rolled by the joint parties on the issue of gold tax? No, not at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we find, in the last couple of days, we have the honourable member for Bennelong saying to Mr O'Dougherty:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Western Australians were quite crucial to the decision to change your leadership?</PARA>
<PARA>Howard: Yes, I know that.</PARA>
<PARA>O'Dougherty: I can only rephrase the question. Is it possible that business figures in Western Australia who were donating to the Liberal Party had a say in your downfall?</PARA>
<PARA>Howard: Oh look, I don't-look, I have no idea. Why don't you go and ask the relevant people?</PARA>
<PARA>O'Dougherty: All right, perhaps we will do that.</PARA>
<PARA>Then on the ABC last night we have Senator Chaney saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, that's a bit of Keating nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Middleton says:</PARA>
<PARA>But people close to John Howard-</PARA>
<PARA>cop this one-</PARA>
<PARA>claim quite the opposite. They say they have no doubt that in 1989 opposition within shadow cabinet to a gold tax was used to make life difficult for the then Opposition leader, the theme the Government has taken up with gusto.</PARA>
<PARA>While the honourable member for Bennelong is not going to mark himself by saying this, people close to him have; so they have gone and said there is no doubt that part of the reason for his removal was his attitude on the gold tax. In the meantime we have:</PARA>
<PARA>`I am the man to lead', says Chaney.</PARA>
<PARA>Red Fred-now Dead Fred. And then we keep coming back to this very, very interesting piece by Peter Rees, again on 14 October 1989, where he outlines it all, and we have this extraordinary claim that everyone has a distortion which suits them-Senator Chaney's claim. All of the gold ticket people, including the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for O'Connor, and the honourable member for Pearce, and the senators-some in the gallery-were about changing the leadership of the Liberal Party because Mr Howard was too expensive a person to the gold industry to be maintained as leader of the Liberal Party.</PARA>

<PARA> It was a serious incident in our national affairs.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as the Government is concerned, we have sat in this place now for two weeks and listened to the utmost canting hypocrisy on the issue of the gold tax and on the issue of campaign donations that has proceeded around it. It is hypocrisy that has finally been found out, finally established, because one member of the Opposition who managed to sit through that canting hypocrisy while the effort was made to impugn the reputation of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on questions of receipt of donations-which he did not at any point of time receive-was prepared to sit there on the front bench and allow that blackguarding to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition, presumably in the full knowledge that it had that sitting there behind it, was prepared to go along with that, and a leader-presuming too that he had full knowledge of it-was prepared to sit there and tolerate that. We have heard in various debates in this chamber a whole raft of efforts by the Opposition to impugn us on a whole series of issues. An allegation has been made by the Opposition that Labor Party policy is there to be bought. When asked to establish that in successive debates in this House, as far as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is concerned he has provided us with nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a serious allegation. It has a specific meaning, that is, there is a sum of money; there is a decision to be made. An amount of money is given to the person who has authority to make that decision or who can influence that decision to be made, and then the decision is made as a result. Pure and simple, that is what buying policy means. As far as the Opposition is concerned, that is the allegation it has made here. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked to establish that-`What do you mean by having your policy bought?'-the Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh well, it has something to do with your relationship with the trade union movement. Your whole wages policy is based on the fact that you have a policy bought'. As far as the Opposition is concerned, that is an example of serious political corruption. It has demeaned the meaning of the term `serious political corruption' because, as far as wages policy is concerned, it sits in the very centre of decent public policy in this country. The fact that this is a party that is prepared to deal with the trade union movement on a sensible basis on behalf of wage earners in this country is used to impugn it, and the allegation is made that the Party is somehow bought. </PARA>
<PARA> In my area of telecommunications, the accusation is made somehow that the policy of the Labor Party has been bought. We all know that there is a public understanding of what that term means, and I go back to it: that somehow there is an exchange of resources or favours in return for a decision that has come forth. The policy decisions were taken by this Government after debate inside our ranks-where there is invariably going to be division on any policy issue. It does not matter what political party one happens to be in, there will be divisions on those sorts of matters. The claim is then made by the Opposition that somehow or other the decision has been bought because we came up with a solution-not a solution, I might say, that the trade union movement or the particular trade unions are concerned about, as they made amply clear at the time, but a decision based on our understanding of what is needed by the telecommunications industry in this country, both to have strength and to have an effective, competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has over the past two weeks debauched the notion of propriety in the way in which it has debated it in this House. It has come into this place with a grab bag of accusations without substance and has attempted to cite that grab bag of accusations as a ground on which the Government or members of the Government ought to have their integrity impugned and their rights to be members of this place ruled out. Of course, it is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Opposition came back to the one area where it was going to try to establish that there was somehow a linkage between political donations and a particular set of decisions in relation to the gold tax. We get here to the nub of the censure notion. The Prime Minister has said from the time he stood up here first to answer questions on this matter that there were no private deals done in regard to the gold tax, or any matters, as far as that is concerned, in return for policy. He has persisted in that. That has not been successfully challenged by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It has asked the same question about 30 different ways, day after day in this chamber, until today. The same question has been asked day after day, and it has received exactly the same answer on each occasion: there was no exchange of money for favours, no private meeting. The Opposition has not established that at any point of time. It has not even had comfort from the person who created the environment in which such an accusation could be laid because that particular individual stated quite emphatically that, in the course of the meeting with the Prime Minister, whatever matters may have been discussed at that meeting, one matter was not discussed and that was the subject of his particular donations. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other meetings, however, which that person had at that particular time with senior politicians of this country in which the subject was most emphatically discussed, of which we have received evidence over the past two weeks, and of course that was with the then Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> People on both sides of this House know the nature of the gold tax debate that took place at that time. It was one involving a whole plethora of factors and influences in Australian national life. There is the question of what is correct policy in that area and, basically, both political parties have at different points of time identified what was correct policy in the gold tax area. </PARA>
<PARA> Both political parties-at least, individuals within them-have at different points of time attempted to establish that; and both political parties confronted the possibilities of severe political losses in pursuing particular courses of action. From our side of the House, of course, that severe political loss would be a product of what the Opposition was arguing at the time in relation to the gold tax, had we persisted with the recommendations which had been placed before us on cleaning up the taxation arrangements of the gold industry-no particular mystery, as far as this country is concerned, as to why we arrived at that those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House arrived at those conclusions, firstly, because we were concerned about the possibility of political losses. I do not make any particular cover for that point; that was an obvious political consequence if we went down the road of changing a position we adopted on the gold tax. The second reason was that there were being presented at the time-in relation to some proposals on deep mining and in relation to some representatives in areas where deep mining of gold might take place, and of course in relation to the gold industry generally, which was earning export dollars at the time arguments which suggested that, if we went and took that course of action, those opportunities might be shut off. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason was that, in the realities of politics in this country, when the Liberal Party states in the course of a close fought election campaign that it will not introduce a gold tax, it leaves the Government nowhere to go or lose office. That effectively was the position we adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> What Liberal Party spokesmen in this place over the last two weeks have tried to do is to suggest that there is another motive: `All those factors, well understood in our national life, are to one side; those are irrelevant. What we shall do is accuse the Labor Party of having based its entire policy on what is alleged to be a donation from Laurie Connell to the Prime Minister'. When those opposite debate the issue of corruption in this place in that debauched fashion, they deprive this chamber of the capacity to be an effective chamber to deal with those issues of public policy which are central to our national life. We did not start this process in this chamber. Those opposite started this process two weeks ago when it came to the question of gold tax. And, boy, do they wish they had not done that at this stage of the game!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cro-Magnon is at it again. Boy, do they wish they had not done that! Professor Leakey will make a fortune out of him when he gets hold of him. When we then had to deal with this point, we came to it from a position of relevance. Those opposite, having stood up in this place and, by making those accusations to us, debauched the decency of this chamber to debate these sorts of issues, then found the issue firmly turned upon themselves. A correct question is now being asked of them: `Why have you come to the various conclusions that you have come to in relation to your position on the gold tax and what influence has that played in the way in which you have determined your stand on national affairs?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me tell those opposite this: they have provided evidence of having back-scuttled in the face of a dishonourable campaign in the worst possible way, and they have never given answers on that, which they could do in this place. We will not, of course, be listening to any answers from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) because his capacity to convey what happened at the time John Howard was overthrown as leader was besmirched by the fact that he was prepared to go on Four Corners and say, `My normal course of approach to my colleagues in the parliamentary party is to lie to them'. We had on the record that the honourable member for O'Connor would wander around the place telling lies when it came to dealing with questions of leadership changes. And we have established--</PARA>

All right, I will withdraw that statement about him in regard to the question of lies. On television he said that he found it extraordinarily difficulty to tell the truth to his colleagues when he was in the process of lobbying them on the subject of leadership changes. During the course of that election campaign one of the leading goldminers in this country-not new goldminers, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out, but one of the old goldminers, Western Mining-said, `We, of course, know that in a week or two we will be getting a position from the Liberal Party on the subject of gold tax; we know we are going to be getting a position from them; just wait for it, you will see it coming down the line'-and indeed they did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What a humiliation this whole episode provided for honourable members opposite. I might say that one of the most interesting features in the declaration of gifts, as I pointed out the other day, is that there is a total lack of coincidence between gifts declared and moneys expended. There is no question of the provision of things coming forward from trust funds, which are admittedly, as I have said here today, a blind that is available to both sides of politics in this country to conceal substantial donations. There is not even that. We have to assume that the funding basis of the Liberal Party's last two campaigns somehow or other disappeared into the ether and that they were paid for by nothing. It just appeared, then disappeared; no bills were presented; it cost the Party nothing. We are expected to believe in this debate that some of these very large companies which have been supporters of the Liberal Party for years made to it no contribution which in any shape or form could find its way into the Liberal Party coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> Remember, we did not start this particular debate on the relationship between the issue of gold tax and these particular matters. This is a debate that has been provoked by opposition members' continuing argument around the point of that alleged statement that the Prime Minister's policy was there to be bought.

The second issue-and this is a new theme that members opposite have warmed to, having had themselves belted about the ears by the Treasurer on this subject-is that somehow or other the questions which those opposite asked and which were perfectly adequately answered at the time of the Rothwells Ltd bail-out are something that this Parliament ought to interest itself in at this point of time. That is a load of nonsense. It is simply slander from them: an attempt to create an atmosphere of difficulty where none exists; an attempt to create a linkage where none exists.

<PARA> Then we had this latest effort in infamy, when the Treasurer clearly established on the record that he had nothing to do with the Rothwells bail-out at the time. He clearly established that on the record. There has been a plethora of material written on Rothwells. All the ghosts in Rothwells are out singing and dancing. They have been out there singing and dancing for the last three years, and none of those ghosts, none of those problems, ever bore the Treasurer's or the Federal Government's face. Not once in those three or four years beyond that initial questioning have those opposite sought to raise in this place until this week those issues to which the Treasurer went. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition expects us to take it seriously as some sort of arbiters of the public good and public morality when it comes down to the question of how we should conduct our affairs in this place.

Only one person has come out into the public light and said that. That was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Many people at the time thought that that was quite a good idea. He was not Robinson Crusoe. He was the one person in authority in the Federal Parliament at that time from whom a comment was sought on what he thought of all of that who gave one. That is what he was. He was not Robinson Crusoe in the general public sense; he was pretty close to it when it came to positions being adopted in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has not established, either in relation to the gold tax area or in relation to the accusations he has made in this other area, any point of impropriety as far as this Government is concerned. What we do know about him on the gold tax is this: whilst his position on the gold tax was, from his own point of view, an aspect of his political opportunism, it was for us a struggle to finalise the establishment of decency in the taxation system in this country, the debauching of which was established quite clearly under the period of time that Fraser was in office and members of the Opposition were his servants. All of them were his servants. That is what we were dealing with when we came to deal with the tax regime in this country. The rorts and ramps that underlay the tax regime were steadily peeled away with the Opposition thrashing us all the way to the election. It thrashed us all the way to the election when we had to deal with each of those particular propositions which imposed enormous burden and pain on us. We had to carry it through. This was the last proposition. Members of the Opposition will go to the next election campaign promising to undo this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition will support those in the goldmining industry with opportunities that arise from a removal of the capital gains tax. He will impose a 15 per cent tax on the ordinary people of this country to make sure that they pay for it. He is totally deserving of censure by this chamber because he is totally unworthy to be debating these sorts of issues in the national Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes this opportunity to reject the censure motion out of hand and to put its case on the record about the events that we have been raising in the course of the last couple of weeks. It is not just in the course of the last couple of weeks that we have been raising these events. We are interested in the proper processes of government in this country. We are interested in ensuring that the Government governs for all the people of Australia, not just its special friends, not its special interests, not just a few of its mates, but all the people of Australia. That is what this debate is about. That is where this debate comes from. It has been a consistent thrust of our position in this Parliament in the last 12 months that this Government governs improperly, that it governs in the interests of just a few people and that it does not govern in the best interests of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This particular motion today arrives for two reasons. The first reason is the leadership issue on the other side. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has sat there defenceless in his attempts to get any publicity for his run for the leadership. Members of the Government know that the man at the table, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), is finished. He sat there as events passed him by. He is playing no part in this. The Prime Minister's surrogate is very concerned about the publicity that the other guy-the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister-has been getting in the course of the last couple of weeks and the way the press has focused on his performance relative to the Prime Minister's bumbling performance. The Leader of the House has started his run for the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why this censure motion has been moved today is the blatant attempt to get out from under WA Inc. The Prime Minister knew WA Inc. was going to go all the way through to the Prime Ministership of this country and he has been trying to duck that issue and remove the stench that is there from his inability to remember and from his inability to do the job that he has been put there to do. After eight years in the job the country is in the worst economic circumstances ever seen since the 1930s. Day after day the Prime Minister stands by while his Treasurer inflicts more and more hardship on average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, there is a leadership challenge on and there is a dead concern about the impact that WA Inc. will have on the Government as a party in the course of the next 12 to 18 months. This censure motion is a cheap attempt to divert attention from the real issues, which is basically the way the Prime Minister attempts to govern this country. It is about the way he does deals, the way he looks after mates and the way he does not operate in the best interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go to the specific allegations raised in relation to WA Inc. in the course of the last couple of weeks, we find a Prime Minister who is suffering from selective amnesia. He has a total inability to remember certain key events and details about the way he changed the Government's gold tax policy in the run-up to the 1987 election. He has very selective amnesia when it comes to key things that we raise, but categorical assurances in other cases in which he knows precisely what happened. He can probably tell us what vegetables were on the plate; he just cannot tell us whether he had a meeting before he went to the lunch on that particular day. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen an attempt on the part of the Prime Minister in the course of the last two weeks to divert attention from the fact that here we have before us, as a result of a set of allegations made in the Western Australian corruption inquiry, a very clear-cut example of precisely the way this Government has operated, precisely the way it looks after its mates and precisely the way it does not govern in the best interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back to the arguments of the Prime Minister in the course of the last two weeks-the last six sitting days-we find that he has been unable to come up with any defence of the allegations that have been made in relation to that lunch and the subsequent change in policy. Indeed, all the evidence on the record disproves the position that he would have us believe applies. Members of the Government are trying to argue that they have never changed policy on the gold tax. They have tried to argue that they are the saints when it comes to reforming taxation in this country. They are trying to create the impression that there was no impact of that lunch on their policy on gold. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go back to December 1986 and when we look at the initial Cabinet decision not to introduce a gold tax we cannot find any mention of a three-year commitment. As we go through every stage of the process after that we cannot find any evidence of a three-year commitment. When does the three-year commitment emerge? It emerges after the lunch that took place in Western Australia. It appears in a letter on 7 July which was not made public until 10 July, just one day before the Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we rationalise this series of events? One possible explanation, which I think is the appropriate one, is that although the Government was on the record in December 1986 as not supporting a gold tax, the Treasurer, Senator Walsh and Senator Evans all intended to introduce a gold tax as soon as they got back into power. They tried to keep that option open right through that pre-election period. The Treasurer is nodding as I am saying this. He knows that he was intending to introduce a gold tax. The problem was that somebody got at Hawke. Hawke did a deal, according to these allegations. Hawke's problem was how could he announce that deal without--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be happy to. The Prime Minister did a deal. He had to announce that deal without risking the public attacks of his Treasurer and his Minister for Finance and Senator Evans at the time. He hung on as long as he could and then he finally put it in that letter on 7 July and it did not appear until 10 July. That is what happened. There was a change in policy that took place after the lunch and after the special meeting of 15 June. The Prime Minister finally had to make that a public commitment so that the donations would come in. It is probably no accident that the date on the receipt given to Laurie Connell for the $250,000 was 14 July, after the election date itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Prime Minister that he has a case to answer. He has to demonstrate precisely how it is that that gold tax policy was changed, given that on every opportunity that he had on the record prior to 15 June to do so he never once mentioned that it was a three-year commitment. He cannot create the illusion that there was a three-year commitment. It never appeared as a three-year commitment until the letter of 7 July and, as I say, was not made public until 10 July. </PARA>
<PARA> Related to this, and an essential element of it, is mateship rather than leadership. What the Prime Minister has demonstrated in recent days in a matter also related to WA Inc. is an incapacity to put leadership above mateship. For example, today in the Senate an urgency motion was moved by the coalition, and successfully passed by the Senate, calling on Senator Gareth Evans to stand down Ambassador Burke. The second challenge I issue to the Prime Minister is this: what is he going to do with that Senate resolution suggesting that the Government now stand down Ambassador Burke before he does any more damage to our international reputation?</PARA>
<PARA> But these guys in government do not care. They do not have any concern for the status of our ambassadorial service. They do not have any concern for the other people-the good men and women that are serving this country at that level. They do not have any concern for the status of that position. They do not have any concern about the impact that that will have on our reputation in Ireland and the Holy See where Ambassador Burke presently operates. They do not have any concern about those things because all they worry about is mateship. </PARA>
<PARA> This begs another question: why does the Prime Minister worry so much about that? He is obviously very concerned as to what Brian Burke might say when he comes back. He is not game to call him on. He is not game to break mateship and show a bit of leadership. He is not prepared to look after the best interests of Australia, and that is indisputable. He is not prepared to bring Brian Burke back because he knows that, if he puts him under pressure, he may lose control of what he is going to say. That is precisely the set of circumstances before us. The Government is putting mateship above leadership at a time of major economic crisis in this country. That is the real tragedy of what we have observed in this Government in the last couple of weeks-that is, the cheap political stunts it has pulled to try to muddy the waters by making accusations about us, saying that we changed our gold tax policy and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some fundamental differences between what happened on our side and what happened on the Government side. First, we have a declared code of conduct in relation to political donations and that has been observed. We are seeing a good example of the Government's code of conduct in WA Inc. right now. Secondly, our fellows were not in government: they have not been in government since then. So they were not delivering any deals. Thirdly, there was no change of policy and there was no discussion of policy by former Senator Chaney when those political donations were sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and perhaps most importantly and most distinctively, honourable members on this side of the House-be they Fred Chaney or John Howard-have a memory, and it is not a selective memory: they have a memory which they have put on the record. This man opposite has not put his memory on the record. His memory is so selective that, when it comes to the absolute crunch points, he says, `Jeez, I dunno. I haven't got any idea'. He has absolutely no idea of the significance of the stupid games which those people play while the rest of this country slides further and further into recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the place where I began in rejecting this censure motion, that is, to point out that there is a proper way to govern this country and those opposite know nothing about it. In almost all cases they have got here by doing deals. The Treasurer's preselection is notorious from the point of view of an example of how to do deals: you get your mates running away on motorcycles in the middle of the night. That is the whole basis on which those opposite operate. They do not think in terms of the best interests of Australia; they think in terms of deals, deals and more deals. When they get into trouble they do another deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of whether they relate to the labour market, the waterfront, the blocking of a development such as Coronation Hill or Wesley Vale, or changing tax policy in Western Australia in the lead-up to the Federal election-they are all deals. The Government cannot move because it is hogtied by deals. The bottom line of those deals is pain and misery for the average Australian. The pain and misery of the average Australian now is worse than it has been since the 1930s and it is entirely the consequence of the processes that those opposite use, the policies they end up adopting as a result of these deals-rather than having the capacity for leadership and getting out and acting in the best interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently we have record bankruptcies, near record unemployment-undoubtedly it will get there in the near term-record numbers of small business failures, and the deepest and most protracted recession since the 1930s. Every time an Australian focus is on the magnitude of the damage the Government has inflicted on people, we will draw their attention to the sorts of deals the Government has done against their best interests. For example, when this country desperately needs genuine and substantial reform and more change than at any time in the last 50 or 60 years, this Government is incapable of delivering it because it is hogtied by the deals it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot deliver in terms of labour market reform, waterfront reform, privatisation, a broad-based goods and services tax and development projects such as Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill. The Government cannot deliver because of the type of person the Prime Minister is and the types of deals he has done right through his political career. The country is paying an enormous price in terms of the impact on its international reputation and the hardship that average Australians are being expected to bear. </PARA>

I am establishing at the outset the total hypocrisy of those opposite-particularly the Leader of the Opposition-because they have revealed throughout the whole of this business that principle is something that they would not recognise and that they have contravened in these debates and in Question Time the most fundamental of principles which must be followed if any democracy is going to be able to properly operate. Not least among those principles is that we cannot have a position in which it is going to be demanded that a person in public office be stood aside simply because allegations have been made against him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout these debates and these proceedings, as I come to these other issues of substance, I am going to hammer the point that members opposite are revealed, they stand totally exposed, as being absent of principle on this issue.

Let me come to this issue of my involvement with Mr Connell, as it is alleged, and compare and contrast it with the situation of the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). The fact is that Mr Connell's own evidence in regard to the question of donations says specifically that I was not involved in the question of his donation. His words were that these matters did not arise until after the Prime Minister had left; that this had happened after the Prime Minister had left. But honourable members opposite would try to tag me with something that happened after I left-a situation in which the honourable member for Pearce was engaged in exactly the opposite situation. Mr Speaker, could you imagine anything more laughable than what was said by the Leader of the Opposition in his debate? He said, `We've got a code of conduct'. Let me remind you, Mr Speaker, of what that code of conduct is that he got up and stood behind, that he has put up as his shield and defence. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>While parliamentarians can and, indeed, should, voice the Party's needs for funds or services (and sign appeal letters), a member of Parliament or candidate should not personally accept money . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What does the honourable member's press release on 16 April say? It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 I was leading the Senate team in WA and agreed to assist the WA Liberal Party in raising funds as the Party had very limited financial resources . . . I approached a number of Perth business people including Laurie Connell, and asked for support for the Party. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he goes to speak of payments which came to his office. </PARA>
<PARA> I am in the position, in regard to this question of a connection between donations from Connell and myself, of having Connell himself saying that I was not there. Those present went to this issue after I left. I contrast that with a man operating under this code of conduct who dashed upstairs to Laurie and said, `Hey, have you got a spare $50,000 or $100,000? What can you spare, Laurie?'. What sort of hypocrisy can we expect from this Opposition? Can we imagine a greater level of hypocrisy than that? Connell himself says that the Prime Minister was not there, and at the same time we have goody-goody two-shoes, as he has been referred to, sitting here, nodding and saying, `Isn't it terrible what the Prime Minister did?'-when Connell said that I did not do it at all. While he is sitting there shaking his head in condemnation of me, he knows that at the very time, he was doing the very opposite-he was directly going and soliciting funds from Connell. </PARA>

On the very Howard test, as you know, Mr Speaker, Mr Connell's evidence itself clears the Prime Minister. What he had to say was:</PARA>
<PARA>What I was wanting was some confirmation of the Prime Minister's view in respect of the introduction of a gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that right throughout this matter, as the honourable member for Bennelong knows and as the honourable Leader of the Opposition should know, my statements before this House have been consistent that there was no private commitment, there was no change of policy, there was nothing told to Mr Connell or anyone else at that luncheon which was not already public knowledge. There was nothing done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the sense that Mr Connell says that he sought a confirmation, that is all he could have got-a confirmation-because it was a matter of public record revealed by the Australian Financial Review the following day. On the sixteenth the Australian Financial Review referred to what I had said on the fifteenth. It said that the Prime Minister had publicly, explicitly, given this undertaking in regard to what would happen. It is known-just as what was contained in all of the 14 press releases of Chaney, Durack, et al was known. They did not say `three years' in any of those; they did not mention three years. They referred to the time of government. Obviously they were not saying that it had been the case for one month or two months. In all those press releases, where they did not mention three years, that was the clear intention. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no political meaning in a situation where people say in an election period-coming up to the next election-that they will not have a gold tax if they do not mean that it is for that period of government. Of course, that is what we did. We did not introduce it in that period of government; what we did do in that next period of government was to do what those opposite-at the cost of how many millions of dollars, I do not know-did not do. Those opposite made the commitment that they would not bring in a gold tax. We were in a position where we had given the commitment. It was not for the next term, but certainly in the next term we made sure that we would do what those opposite would not do. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me finally say this about the Leader of the Opposition. He had the gall and the temerity to talk about this Government, in the area of taxes, dealing with its mates. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of another royal commission, the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was simply that there would be no gold tax. But the industry sources-the rumours were about the corridors of power-indicated that in fact that policy was about to change. We need to understand that background. The public statements, the public agenda, from the Treasurer of the day and the Prime Minister of the day in the broadest terms was that there would be no gold tax, but indeed the change was on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then had the secret agenda, which was very clear-cut. It was exposed last week by Senator Walsh. The secret agenda was that there would be no gold tax before polling day, that a gold tax would be introduced in the first Budget after the 1987 election if Labor were successful, and that would apply shortly thereafter. We then had a third dimension, one which has not been fully recognised and one which I bring to the House. It is the report of the inquiry into the taxation of goldmining, dated August 1986. It is sometimes referred to as the Gutman report. What does the Gutman report say about goldmining? It states:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Sections 23 (o) and 23c should be removed making income from gold mining subject to taxation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>2. There should be no phase-in period for introducing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: no phase-in period. The Government's own report ruled out the very course of action which this Government then embarked upon with a three-year phase-in period. That is why we legitimately ask: what is the rationale for the Government's conduct and its actions and the commitments given by the Prime Minister in his letter dated 7 July 1987? Suddenly, this Government's public agenda and its secret agenda were thrown out the window. Suddenly, out of the blue, we had a more finite, a more specific, commitment-an absolute commitment-that no gold tax would be introduced within a three-year period. That came in the letter from the Prime Minister dated 7 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The House has a right to know why the change. The nation has a right to know why the change-and why and how the Government justified the change against the background of the Government's own report in August 1986, which argues in very clear-cut terms that there should be no phase-in period for introducing the gold tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a clear-cut situation. The motion before the House is cant and hypocrisy coming from the Government, coming from the leadership contenders of the Labor Party. In fact there was a very sharp change in the announcements of the Government about the gold tax. Senator Walsh has given the lie to the defence mounted in this House. He said that the Treasurer and he were angry that the Prime Minister had suddenly given this upgraded commitment on gold tax. Senator Walsh said that they had not expected it, that they did not want it, and that suddenly the Prime Minister, out of the blue, had completely changed tack on the gold tax. The proof of that is in this report, which the Government had had since August the previous year and which was absolutely clear cut. The House and the nation have a right to know. There is another aspect to this matter, and that is mateship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has said all these things about distortions and yet the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has got the gall to talk about special friends when those opposite have, in fact, changed their policy and removed their leader to change their policy. He talks about special friends and governing for everybody. He was fuming at the end of his speech about how we should be discussing the great national issues. He referred to the recession in the late 1930s. What is the matter of public importance about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The need for the Prime Minister to give a full and coherent explanation of WA Inc . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Leader of the Opposition's great national issue. Then he referred to the Prime Minister's selective amnesia. What did the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) say when he was asked about the meeting with Mr Bond? He said, `I cannot give you a verbatim account of every minute detail of a conversation. Could you remember a conversation you had four years ago?'. That is not an issue. I can remember the discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the House earlier this week, the honourable member for Bennelong blew the Leader of the Opposition's case apart when he said, `You cannot impugn the Prime Minister over selective amnesia when I am saying that I cannot be expected to remember what I said at a meeting four years ago'. That is absolutely what he implied. That is his quotation. The Leader of the Opposition then talked about no change of policy, when we find all these press releases from senators about all that glitters. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the very interesting issue of Senator Durack. He actually told the Senate about the written letter undertaking from the honourable member for Bennelong two weeks before the undertaking was actually published. He is recorded in the Senate as saying so. I have the references here of the Senate debate where Senator Durack said this. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has the absolute temerity to try to suggest that there was no change of policy on the Opposition's part. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition then parades himself as a person of integrity. He was impugning the reputation of the Prime Minister while he knew of the position of the honourable member for Pearce. He was happy to stand up here and impugn the reputation of the Prime Minister knowing that one of his own front bench had asked and received $50,000 from the same person. How could he describe himself as a person of integrity when he is up impugning the motives of the Prime Minister, the chief Minister of the Government, saying that he has shifted his policy when one of his own front bench had been to the same person in question, the said Mr Connell, and had asked and received $50,000? That is what this `person of integrity' is supposed to have us believe as he puts these questions. While he was putting these questions to the Prime Minister, he knew of the press report reporting Alan Bond. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Fundraising did not arise during discussions because when I referred to Mr Howard's meeting with Bond he said, ` We know all about that, we have seen the report'. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, he had seen the report; he had also seen the paragraph above where the spokesman for Mr Bond said that the question of fundraising did not arise during discussions. The Leader of the Opposition knew that, but it was not going to put him off his dirty game, was it? He is an ideas person, someone new in public life, not besmirched by the rest. What a joke! Let me not hear from the press gallery ever again that he is a non-political person. Frankly, we will faint if we hear again that he is an ideas person. He is not really out of the mould of most politicians, he is just a common old garden Liberal, just a common old garden conservative right wing hack who will try to besmirch an honest person's reputation for just cheap political advantage. That is his position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has asked these questions, knowing nothing. He knew that the honourable member for Pearce had got $50,000 and he knew of the Bond report, but he asked these questions for two weeks. You fraud. You disgraceful, disgusting fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Pearce said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Yes, but the test is the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Pearce failed the test because he turned his Party Leader's view over. He voted against the Bills to tax the income from goldmining companies and we did not. This week, in humbug which only he can traffic in, in a media release headed, `Chaney called for end of fragmented decision making', he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Government had a key role to play in this process by giving some sense of national purpose while ensuring that it was not the creature or captive of any industry or lobby group. </PARA>
<PARA>Only somebody with no pride whatsoever, only someone with the front of a Liberal front bencher could get up and give a long speech on the environment and say-after he had his record paraded in front of him about distortions he favours about securing funds while impugning another man's reputation-that there should be a sense of national purpose. This is the sort of humbug which just makes us sick and it particularly made us sick about the honourable member for Pearce. He has been playing this goody-goody role for years, running around the thing, sort of Red Fred-he is not really right wing-a bit tense, with a sort of social conscience. When he had the social security job he did this and did that. They said, `Oh, he is not a bad guy'. He went round the gallery. He is one of the Menzian-type Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact what we find is that the member for Pearce is really red hot; he is up to his ears in any matter that can advance the partisan interests of his Party. The member for Pearce has very hard right wing views, and he pushes them for all they are worth. But worse than that, he protects constituencies, as he put it. Then the member for Pearce goes on with this disgusting humbug. This is what we have had from these people. This is a disgusting Opposition; this is not an Opposition with a skerrick of integrity. It is up there attacking the Government for everything, even suggesting that the Prime Minister changed the policy. There was a crude interjection from one of the Victorian members about the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and he made the charge that the Prime Minister had closed it down-and had established the National Crime Authority in its place, which the honourable member did not mention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Costigan Royal Commission opened it up and lifted the rug on all the rotten corrupt tax practices in this country, which Senator Durack, as Attorney-General, had let happen despite the fact that he had been warned-the famous two-year gap in the documents which Senator Durack had been given. This is the same Senator Durack who waddled up and down St Georges Terrace looking for contributions from goldmining companies, from Western Mining Corporation and all the Opposition members' pals down on the strip from Kalgoorlie to Coolgardie. That is what the Opposition is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government came along and said, `Oh, we better make the taxation system decent; we will tax all income, including capital gains; we will bring in a fringe benefits tax (FBT) for people who have cars, credit cards and all the rest; we will stop this ramp of entertainment being a deduction; we will actually tax lump sums so that we can set up a decent retirement income system for the whole of the community; we will actually put an assets tax on social security payments, so people of real wealth do not get it; and we will tax gold'. No, no, the Opposition would not have a bar of that. It has punished us for every measure; politically, the Opposition has taken us to elections and has punished us for every measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong in the 1987 election campaign got up and campaigned against all these things-`We'll remove Labor's capital gains tax; Labor's FBT; we will turn over the entertainment deduction; we will remove the tax on lump sums; we will turn over Labor's assets test.' We remember: the Opposition has never done anything decent to make the tax system better, and when the Government has done it, particularly with gold, and especially in this case with gold, the Opposition has frustrated us in this House by opposing it and then opposing it in the Senate when its then leader knew that there could be no rational case for exempting one metal against other metals. He knew it, said it, and was rolled by a front bench that had sold itself to the Western Australian gold industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So we know what policy buying means. As my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said, we know what policy buying means. The Opposition has shown us in the most vivid and graphic way that could be imagined, and yet Opposition members have the hide to ask me questions today about Rothwells four years ago, when they know clearly that the Government had no involvement in that rescue package. Opposition members failed when they attacked the Prime Minister, so they are trying to get up another issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), who is about to get up to speak: where is the honourable member for Pearce? Why is he not speaking in the debate? Why is he not up here? In fact, we on this side will extend the debate to allow the honourable member for Pearce to make a contribution, and we will see his veracity; but to have now another cheap, tawdry political speech from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who traffics in all sorts of distortions to make a cheap political point, will not cut the ice. The fact is that Opposition members have impugned the reputation of the Prime Minister, they have failed and they deserve the censure of the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this motion, which is that this House censures the Opposition for its hypocrisy on the issue of a gold tax. Let me graphically demonstrate what I think of this censure motion by tearing it up. It is literally not worth the paper it is written on. I must say that I think this is a sad day for this Parliament. I ask myself: what are the people in the gallery and those who are listening to parliamentary proceedings today to make of the performance of this Parliament? We talk about standards; we talk about people's respect for the Parliament. No wonder the respect for this Parliament has been subject to diminution in recent years, when we have the sort of sham and shameful performance that we have had from this Government today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the people listening to this debate now would they have any sense, any appreciation, of the fact that it was only a few days ago that we heard that the unemployment level had risen to 9.2 per cent? Would they have any sense that there are over 800,000 on the unemployment queues as a result of the recession that this Government has admitted it deliberately induced? Would those people have any sense that not only are there over 800,000 people unemployed, but also there are over 400,000 people who would work more if they had the opportunity to do so? That is, 1.2 million Australians are unable to fully satisfy their desires to work and to achieve a standard of living for their families. </PARA>
<PARA> They would have no sense from listening to this debate that this country has had in the past few years a massive increase in our national debt. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) came to office, this country had a debt of only about $20 billion. The Government is forever saying that today's problems are the fault of the last Liberal Government, but it has never explained how it is that under this Government our country's debt has risen from $20-odd billion to a massive $131 billion today, and rising. I say to my colleagues in the Parliament: we are simply kidding ourselves if we believe that this country can continue to live off debt. We are addicted to debt, and the more time we spend playing games, as this Government is doing today, the longer will be delayed the essential reforms that really would make a difference to the people in the gallery and to the people listening to this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to round off these introductory remarks, I have an interesting statistic that came out earlier this week from some research. It reveals that under this Government, the rich have been getting richer and the poor have been getting poorer; a massive gap has been widening between those who are fortunate to be well off and those who are unfortunate to suffer a continuing decline in their living standards. There was not a mention today from this Government of that simple but very embarrassing statistic; it is not just a statistic, it indicates the true consequences of the Australian Labor Party's economic policies and the failure of leadership of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said today about the gold tax and the policies of both parties at the last election. If one goes back to the 1987 election, one finds that as people went to the polls on Saturday, 11 July 1987, both the major political parties were opposed to the introduction of a gold tax. In fact, there is an advertisement from the goldminers stating that loudly and clearly for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation that has been made in the corruption royal commission in Western Australia is that this Government changed its mind about the gold policy that it took to the 1987 election. It is true that both parties opposed the gold tax, but it is on the public record and well known that while Labor publicly opposed the gold tax, it secretly intended to introduce it after the 1987 election. The allegation is that Labor abandoned that secret intention as a result of influence exerted upon the Prime Minister at a lunch. That is the central allegation. There is no allegation about the Liberal Party of Australia and the gold tax policy that it took to the 1987 election. Why was there no allegation? Why could there be no allegation? Because there was no change in the policy. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation made is an allegation about the Prime Minister's conduct; and a very serious allegation it is. Let me simply quote to the House the evidence that has been put before the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Is there any doubt whatsoever in your mind that you obtained a personal commitment out of the mouth of the prime minister that no gold tax would be introduced if Labor was returned at the next election?</PARA>
<PARA>What did Mr Connell say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There's absolutely no doubt in my mind at all. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt whatsoever in his mind. We all now know that secretly $950,000 was collected after that lunch and it just happened to find itself across in the coffers of the Federal Labor Party to assist it with the 1987 election campaign. That is the guts of the allegation that has been made; that is the basis upon which allegations have been put to the Prime Minister, and to which a response has been sought from him. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that that is the allegation, an unanswered allegation from the Prime Minister; given that the Prime Minister is under pressure to respond to that, what do we find from this Government? What do we find? We find it attacking the Opposition. It really is the classic. The economy is in recession-it blames the Opposition. The Prime Minister faces an allegation of impropriety, so it blames the Opposition. Now it is absolute nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, has contrived an elaborate defence mechanism against what it knew was going to be exposed in the royal commission into corruption in Western Australia, and of course part of that was disclosure provisions. The Government says, `Oh, these disclosure provisions aren't good enough'. One would never know that it was the Labor Party which introduced the disclosure provisions, with all their loopholes, back in 1984. Is it coincidence that six years later there is suddenly this great enthusiasm for reforming the disclosure laws? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government brings forward the disclosure law issues, which we support as a matter of principle-we will debate the merits of the legislation when we see the detail-but no one should be fooled about the cynicism behind Labor's motive in attracting that. The Government has run out of money, of course, and is concerned about its prospects at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> A second characteristic of the attack on the Opposition is the leadership tussle between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Not only was this an elaborate tactic to try to throw mud on the Opposition and say to the public, `You know, politicians are all just as bad as the other'-a favourite tactic-but it was launched by the Treasurer as part of his own game plan to knock off the Prime Minister. It is to make the Treasurer look good. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we find a third motive, and that is to divert attention from the Treasurer's own involvement in WA Inc. Today we had a very inadequate, dissembling, confused and contradictory response from the Treasurer during Question Time about his own involvement with Rothwells. Remember, the Rothwells Bank lies at the epicentre of WA Incorporated, at the epicentre of this sordid and corrupt saga now known as WA Inc., and the subject of a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the questions put to the Treasurer, and the charge against the Treasurer, are that he misled the Parliament as a result of his involvement in the Rothwells rescue. Critical in that claim, that charge against the Treasurer, is his claim back in the Parliament on 26 October 1987 that he knew nothing of the details of the Rothwells financing or its structure apart from what he had read in the newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> His statement yesterday-confirmed today-was that he had had a telephone conversation with Mr Peter Beckwith of the Bond Corporation on that crucial date, 23 October. The reason I say it is the crucial date is that on the public record, in the interim report of the National Companies and Securities Commission, there is evidence-accepted and endorsed by the interim Commission report-which states that on 22 October the directors of Rothwells contemplated putting Rothwells into receivership, but then abandoned that plan and decided to proceed with the rescue of Rothwells: 22 October-a date to be fixed in our minds. </PARA>
<PARA> It was late on 22 October or on 23 October that the Treasurer received a telephone call from Mr Beckwith. Mr Beckwith was not a member of Rothwells who was concerned about the day-to-day management of Rothwells; he was the managing director of Bond Corporation. As is well known, it was Bond Corporation that led the rescue, that gathered together those in corporate Australia who were prepared to support the rescue of the Rothwells Bank. So it is that when Mr Beckwith contacted the Treasurer he was not just ringing up as some sort of gossip merchant to give the Treasurer the latest from the markets in Perth; he rang as a principal agent of those who were gathering that very day, as confirmed in official evidence to the National Companies and Securities Commission. He rang the Treasurer as the principal of the rescue team for Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Australia Bank, which was the subject of the conversation between Mr Beckwith and the Treasurer, was the backer to Rothwells which was putting together the $150m bail out package, part of a total package of $370m. I believe that the National Australia Bank, whilst being prepared to be in it in terms of providing the $150m, was prepared to be in it only on the basis of a guarantee from the Western Australian Government and, most importantly, only on the basis that it satisfied the Reserve Bank of Australia about prudential requirements vis-a-vis its additional exposure of $150m to Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask myself: why is it that Mr Beckwith rang the Treasurer? I say he rang because he wanted to ensure that the Reserve Bank would give the necessary approvals for the $150m from the National Australia Bank to bail out Rothwells. On the facts that is the only reasonable interpretation that one can come to as to the possibilities and the motives of Mr Beckwith contacting the Treasurer. That is not a piece of information that the Treasurer wants on the public record. Why does he not? Because in the week after, when he was asked what was his involvement in the Rothwells rescue, he claimed no involvement in the Rothwells rescue. He said, `Look, all I know is what I read in the papers', and he attempted to distance himself, to wash his hands of that saga-the putrid centre of WA Inc. in the Rothwells Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Today when the Treasurer was asked as to what advice he received, he was confused. Today he said that he personally had received advice from the Reserve Bank, and yet on the public record yesterday, in Hansard, it is in fact shown that it was his office that was to contact Rothwells on that fateful 23 October, just following the share market crash. They are contradictory answers which require an explanation. So it was that I asked him: `You stated today, Treasurer, that you received advice on 23 October from the Reserve Bank. Was it in writing or was it verbal'-to which we had no reply but a reply in the form of a censure motion from the Leader of the House as a diversionary tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Government it is a sad day, because this country, in a state of economic crisis, needs some leadership. We do not need the political games that it plays. I can guarantee that no one out there in the real world will give the Government a moment's time as a result of the silly games that it played today. This is nothing but a farce. The Government ought to be ashamed for treating the Parliament with the disrespect it does-with this nonsense motion. The Government will carry this motion on the numbers, I say to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, but it will not carry the spirit of this motion in the community. It deserves to be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made some remarks about the fact, publicly known as far back as October 1987, that Mr Alan Bond contacted me in relation to the Rothwells bail-out. The circumstances are that Mr Bond rang me on the Sunday evening of the weekend of the bail-out. He informed me in general terms that the bail-out was under way. It was the first I knew of the bail-out, although I had read in the newspapers previously of some of the difficulties of the Rothwells bank. He told me that the bail-out was being held up because the Western Australian Premier, Mr Burke, was refusing to sign the government guarantee unless Barry MacKinnon, the Leader of the Liberal Opposition, gave him a political indemnity against any criticism of the deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was essentially what Burke was saying to Bond, to MacKinnon and to all the others-`Look, I will sign the guarantee, providing MacKinnon guarantees not to criticise it'. It was the first that I knew of it, so I rang MacKinnon and he explained the circumstances to me. He explained the reason why the Liberal Party in Western Australia was unwilling to accede to Burke's request. I indicated to him that I thought his position was reasonable and understandable. I subsequently spoke to Bond again. I told him of MacKinnon's position. I told him that I did not believe MacKinnon would change his view and that I would not be seeking to put any pressure on him to do so, because I believed the view that MacKinnon took to be correct. I maintain that to this day. I would like, just for the edification of the Treasurer--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Yesterday the honourable member for Bass as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and on behalf of the Committee, raised a matter of privilege.

<PARA> It is alleged that Mr Willis, a shareholder in a company, has been asked to withdraw his submission and that a statement has been made to the effect that, unless Mr Willis withdraws the submission, proposed changes in a company structure may not be supported by the Chairman of the company.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government proposes to request that this Committee make an amendment to the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill, which is before the Committee, in order to accommodate in principle certain views expressed by the Opposition but to set out in the legislation an achievable result. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the requested amendment be not made, but that, in place thereof, the Bill be amended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 7, page 3, at the end of the clause add the following subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Before regulations are made for the purposes of section 6, the Commissioner must consult the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and such other persons as the Commissioner considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) A failure to comply with subsection (2) does not affect the validity of the regulations.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government appreciates the underlying intention of the Opposition in requesting an amendment to insert into the provisions of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 certain requirements concerning consultation with the superannuation industry about the superannuation levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had very much in mind the importance of consultation with the superannuation industry and other relevant bodies. Accordingly, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has been directed to maintain full liaison on these matters. The Commission has already undertaken consultation with the superannuation industry on the levy for the first year of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that in introducing the legislation the Government did not consider that it should be necessary to insert such requirements regarding consultation in the provisions of the Bill, but rather that it is appropriate to achieve the consultation requirements by other means. In particular, the Government considers it would not be appropriate to have restrictive provisions in the Bill such as those which have been proposed by the Opposition because, for reasons which I will discuss shortly, it might not always be possible to achieve such requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Before moving on to the arrangements which are already in place regarding consultation with the superannuation industry, I want to place on the record my objection to the timing of the Opposition in moving the amendment to the Bill and the confusing way in which it did it. The Bill was introduced in this place several weeks before debate commenced on it. We have had a lot of criticism on this side of the chamber for the fact that we do not give enough notice to enable the Opposition to respond. In this case, there was ample time for the Opposition to make its views known. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech on 9 April, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) indicated that at the committee stage of the Bill the Opposition would seek to make some changes to the regulations to make sure that the Treasurer was directed to consult the `insurance organisations'-and I emphasise those words, `insurance organisations', because that is how it appears in the Hansard-about the superannuation levy. Why anybody would seek to consult insurance organisations about the superannuation levy is beyond me, and clearly it did not make sense, but it added to the confusion in the way in which this was brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The first we knew of a proposed amendment to the Bill was the circulation of a paper during debate on 10 April which indicated that the honourable member for Dawson was to move an amendment to the Bill concerning consultation, this time with the superannuation industry-at least the right industry. That is not what he said the day before. The amendment was moved virtually after the debate was over. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, the Government had given its assurances that consultation would take place, and it is taking place already. I am confident that the amendment now moved by the Government meets the concerns expressed by the Opposition in this place and by the Opposition and Australian Democrats in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the issue itself in hand today, the arrangements which the Government proposed in bringing forward the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 include a requirement for consultation with the superannuation industry. My second reading speech for the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 indicates that the intention of the levy is to recover the cost of the supervision of the industry and that there would be annual discussions with the industry in the determination of the scale of the levy. In addition, the speech also indicated that consultation is to take place between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Department of Finance in determining the amount of revenue needed to fully recover costs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, discussions have already been undertaken with industry representatives concerning the amount of the first year's levy. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the industry consultations, which are continuing, are with a broad grouping of superannuation industry bodies and representatives, not just with the two associations mentioned in the request for amendment circulated by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy here today to reaffirm the Government's commitment to consultation with a broad range of bodies and persons in the superannuation industry on an annual basis and to reaffirm that the amount of revenue required to be raised by the levy would be agreed annually with the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the Government requesting the amendment before the House is to acknowledge the concerns expressed by the Opposition regarding the consultation process and to set out such a process in the Bill in a way which will provide for these industry consultations with a wide group of bodies and persons-in other words, wider than the two associations mentioned in the Opposition's requested amendment-and not require the involvement of the Minister in the consultation, as was proposed by the Opposition. It is the Government's view that the involvement of the Minister in this level of discussion would not be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we want to ensure that the mechanism required for consultation can actually be achieved. The concerns I have with the Opposition's views on this matter are that it may not be practical or possible, in some circumstances, to have regard only to the views of the industry associations mentioned by the Opposition. Those mentioned in the amendment are the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Ltd and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. If, for instance, these industry associations expressed divergent views it might not be possible to have regard to all of the views, and that could threaten the validity of the whole of the levy regulations. A requirement to have regard to industry views could also be seen to be too restrictive if it were seen to be exclusive. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting the scale of the levy, it is likely that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner would need to have regard to other factors. These would include taking account of relevant aspects of the Government's retirement incomes policy and cost recovery policy and taking account of the views of other persons and bodies, including the Department of Finance. The Government amendment I have moved places a legal obligation on the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to consult with the superannuation industry. He is bound to observe this obligation, and bodies whose interests are affected could bring action in the courts to enforce such consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause (3) of the proposed amendment has been included not to negate subclause (2) in any way but to ensure that the validity of the regulations cannot be threatened. Without such a clause it is strongly arguable that trustees could claim that there had been some technical deficiency in the consultation. This could be used as a ground to challenge the validity of the levy regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I have outlined, the Government requests an amendment to the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill 1991 which would ensure that consultation was undertaken but which would not, of necessity, include the Minister; which would require consultation with a broad representation of the superannuation industry; and which would allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to take account of relevant matters other than industry views concerning the supervisory levy. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the surface, this appears to be almost what the Opposition put forward at the time of the general debate on the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Bill. I will take up a few points. First, as I understand it, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) was not present in the House to reply to the second reading debate. I am not sure to what extent he was present during the general debate. Certainly he was not here when I was leading the debate for the Opposition, nor was he here at the end. In fact, I remember an exchange between the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), who was at the table at the time, and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) about why the Minister was not here. The Minister should be here, not for the whole debate but certainly during its closing stages. The Minister was not here that night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister talked about absence of knowledge of the amendments. On the morning after I spoke, the Minister's office and the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner got in touch with my office to find out the meaning of the amendment. That was a warning of at least 12 hours before the closing of the debate. In fact, I think 36 hours elapsed. To say that there was no warning is absolute hogwash. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister talked about warnings, but this is the first indication I have had from the Minister on this matter. I did not know about his proposed speech. In addition, we were unaware of how the Senate would view the amendment we had moved. The Minister talked about there being no warning, but there was 36 hours warning-enough for the Minister at the table to come in with a prepared speech from which there would be no deviation. He could argue the case and it would appear in the Hansard. At that stage there was no intimation that the Government would agree to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the difference in the terms of the amendments now before us. If the Minister had been here at the time to debate his legislation it would not have been necessary for us now to debate these amendments. My point is that this has gone from the House of Representatives to the Senate. It is obvious from the manner in which the Senate has passed the amendments that there has been no intervention by the Minister to argue the points he is now arguing at this very late stage. I do not agree with him when he says that the case for clause 7 (3) is strongly arguable. It states that, before regulations are made, the Commissioner must consult. In the next sentence it is stated that a failure to comply with subsection (2) does not affect the validity of the regulations. That is double talk. Without the advantage of hearing the argument or seeing the reasons for this, it is strongly arguable that this in effect means that the Commissioner may not consult at all. There is no consultative mechanism in this. Failure to comply is an acknowledgment that it will not be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not accept these amendments for those reasons. They vary considerably from the thrust of the debate in the Senate. Firstly, we were not notified. The Minister has obviously not talked to anyone. It was only by accident, because I was in the chamber at the time, that I knew it was being called on. The Minister gave my office no notice that this was to be brought on, nor did he give me the advantage of looking at it so that I could discuss it with my colleague in the Senate who is responsible for this area to get his reaction. At this stage, because of the lack of consultation and because of the wording of the amendment, the Opposition will not accept it. It is double talk; it does not conform with what we were looking at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to these Appropriation Bills, my comments tonight are directed at the Government's industry statement and relate to those matters relevant to technology and its application across the manufacturing sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin by commending the Government for its initiative in reviewing the commercial orientation of industry related research and development (R and D) programs conducted by the Industry Research and Development Board (IRDB), to which I will speak shortly. The Government's actual plans, however, are ill defined and constitute statements of intention. As I foreshadowed in the House on a previous occasion regarding legislation affecting the IRDB's discretionary grants and generic technologies grants schemes, this is a direction in which the coalition will move. If Australia is to make a fist of commercialisation, it will need to work towards building a much more commercially oriented technology development program. The public research sector is coming to realise this truth. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government's intention is to encourage industrial R and D which is internationally competitive and has significant commercial application, I am curious as to how this is achievable under the current structure of the generic technologies grants scheme. A prioritised strategic R and D grants scheme, while admirable for its social role, tends to lack the hard-nosed commercial orientation for a scheme masquerading under an industry related R and D program. I look forward to witnessing the Government's own initiatives in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also announced an initiative designed to assist in the pace at which Australian companies take up locally produced advanced manufacturing technologies. While the initiative, if it can be called that, has hitherto gone without any public and detailed explanation, it too must be seen as a move designed to redress failings on the part of the Government. A report released last month by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce demonstrated the extent to which there has been under-investment in advanced production equipment in Australian industry. The report, entitled Australian Science Innovation Impact Brief, clearly demonstrated the extent to which the investment climate had militated against the replacement of equipment with advanced technologies. The extent to which Australian industry makes use of basic robotics in production processes is appallingly low by international standards. All in all, some 30 per cent only of Australia's medium-sized firms have no familiarity whatsoever with advanced manufacturing production processes. On the basis of available business surveys, some 65 per cent of Australia's small firms are unacquainted with computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, which are at the heart of advanced manufacturing processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to extend the relevant bounty scheme for machine tools and robots and to create a form of procurement program to develop and trial local manufacturing technologies is meant to redress this problem to some undefined degree, but in so doing it makes a mockery of certain of the past claims made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> The House will recall that it was informed, along with the Australian public, that Australia's massive import bills were feeding a once in 20 years' capital stock replacement program in local industries. If this is so, why are we back here introducing schemes of this sort, which really are an indirect means of compensating for market-driven forces which make for genuine technological restructuring? We are back here for the simple truth that the economic conditions which determine the extent to which industries invest in plant and equipment and develop long term technology strategies have been absent. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures confirm that high interest rates have sharply curtailed the manufacturing sector's capacity to re-equip itself. This is the fundamental problem for Australian industry in re-equipping itself. In fact, the share of gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to new plant and equipment is at its lowest level since 1975. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 6.8 per cent of output was invested in new capital stock over the course of the last financial year. This represents the third-lowest annual investment in new plant, equipment and machinery in the past 30 years. The other lowest years on record were 1974 and 1975-coincidentally also under the stewardship of a Labor Treasurer. The next quarter's figures may be worse still. It is conceivable that the Government, despite the Treasurer's past claims, will preside over the worst level of annual industry reinvestment in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> In last year's Budget statement, the Government predicted that investment in new plant and equipment would fall by 4 per cent. What prediction does the Government offer now that we are well and truly into an engineered recession? Is it any wonder that the Government made a quick grab for a depreciation policy in the industry statement? The Government knows what is staring it in the face. While depressing in their own right, these observations about the rates of reinvestment tell us just how far Australia really has to go before its manufacturing sector is able to obtain even a measure of competitiveness in respect of its production processes. Each year industry dips in its reinvestment levels, the further and further ahead streak its trading rivals. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the course of the industry statement, the Government also committed itself to the further open-ended extension of the 150 per cent tax incentive scheme, which after 1993 will be at a reduced rate of 125 per cent. That is a low-risk initiative; the Government will not be here to meet the cost in forgone revenue that this will result in. So the scheme, quite frankly, will be handed on to the incoming coalition government. It is a commitment which should not have been made in the absence of a mandatory review period. This is not a political judgment; it is just a sound public administration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also add that in throwing open the taxation scheme in perpetuity, the Government has sent the wrong signals to industry on its approach to industry development strategy. Schemes such as the 150 per cent tax incentive scheme must be accountable to public scrutiny. I think the Government must balance the carrot-and-stick approach; the Government must provide an incentive to industry to look to and actually experience the rewards of higher investment in research and development, but it must not promote a sense that the public purse will for all time be the essential trigger for making decisions in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is to be used effectively, the scheme must provide the impetus for expanding levels of private sector R and D in the economy. But what if the level of R and D slows or plateaus in the next few years? If this happens, what will be the role and function of this scheme? Is it then to underwrite a nominal level of R and D investment, which might represent core industry commitments alone? Generally speaking, the knowledge of the determinants of current levels of R and D expenditure in the private sector is still inadequate or, at best, imperfect. Australia does not have an historical perspective-that is, a sufficiently stable representation of R and D performances over time-to make hard and fast judgments about the long term significance of schemes such as the 150 per cent R and D taxation incentive scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the Government has not been able to sift out the key factors making for R and D activities, and quantify them or their outcomes with any accuracy. We do not know on any empirical basis, for instance, whether current levels of R and D would have been attained without the existence of the incentive; that is to say, there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to the direct and real impact of the existence of the scheme on management decisions as against other larger financial issues affecting the company's performance, or as a result of changing business strategies. We need to study R and D performances over time and in different economic circumstances in order to make firm judgments about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the changing definitions of R and D have dramatically altered statistical representations of levels of research and development activity. In view of this, the Australian economy is still coming to grips with the concept of R and D activity and management and, particularly, R and D measurement. Despite this the Government has seen fit to throw open access to the 150 per cent research and development taxation incentive for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> A review simply designed to assess the scheme would take into account the continuing relevance regarding the extent to which it is effectively changing industry attitudes in respect of R and D investment, the impact of changing economic circumstances on its operation, the implication of such matters as dividend imputation for its effectiveness, and the extent to which it is simply effective in realising its objectives in respect of other social objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> These tests are essential to measure the commitment of the public purse to a 150 per cent tax scheme, let alone an open-ended 150 per cent research and development tax incentive scheme. Such schemes do have relevance in the current economic environment, but they should also play a role as a means of encouraging industry to develop eventually its own self-sustaining R and D effort. What sort of signal is an open-ended taxation deduction scheme free of any continuing built-in review sending to industry? Moreover, what indication does it give of the Government's commitment to common standards of public administration?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also moved towards recognition of the impact of the wholesale sales tax system, but not nearly sufficiently so. The wholesale sales tax system impacts disproportionately upon the high technology industry sector. The limited and qualified efforts to alleviate this in the industry statement of 12 March will not markedly affect this situation. The statement provides for changes to the wholesale sales tax system which will alter only $375m of the incidence of tax. The incidence of wholesale sales tax on business input actually amounts to in excess of $5 billion. So one can see that the Government's changes are a drop in the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Government made a vain attempt to lure the superannuation and other investment funds into a contrived venture capital pool. The industry understandably baulked. It will understandably baulk again when word filters through that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) would like to see union influence at work in the direction of investment decisions affecting superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, we now see the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, offering to offset the impact of the Government capital gains tax if the superannuation funds would only come to the party. At least Senator Button has come to understand how serious is the impact of the capital gains tax on the mobility, and therefore on the availability of venture capital across the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter about which the Industry Commission will have a great deal to say in the wash-up from its inquiry into obstacles to the formation of venture capital in Australia. The rush to formulate the industry statement for last March has, of course, meant that the Government is out of kilter with the Industry Commission's findings in this regard. There is little doubt that the Government will be unwilling to listen to the Industry Commission's findings in respect of the availability of venture capital. We already know that it will largely argue that the pool of venture capital is directly affected by the dynamism and performance of the industrial base. If one wishes to understand this, then one must look at how the venture capital industry operates in countries like the United States of America, Japan and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of local capital and therefore interest rate policy, the level of domestic savings, the taxation settings which determine capital mobility and so forth are all matters which will provide a direct critique of Government taxation and macro-economic policies. No wonder the Government chose to pre-empt the Industry Commission's report. We all know just where the Government stands on those critical economic settings which determine the viability of the manufacturing sector-indeed, for all industries in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's preoccupation with schemes like a directed fund of funds, and so forth, provides further testimony to its failure to bring change where change is needed. For all the debate about the need to direct superannuation funds to provide capital support for high technology industries, the Government has turned its back on one of the main determinants of capital support for, as an example, research and development efforts within small high technology start-up companies, and that is the cost of capital itself, or interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> For advice on this matter, the Government had no need to go further than its own Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) in this regard. In its 1987 review into small business, the BIE surveyed 119 high technology companies. The survey spanned biotechnology companies, communications and information technology companies, micro-electronics companies, and new materials and scientific and medical instruments industries. The survey revealed that the major constraint to higher levels of R and D activity was the cost of capital. It was not just fragile start-up companies which were adversely affected in this regard, but the more stable ends of the more high technology industry sector. The BIE review concluded, at page 29:</PARA>
<PARA>The factor which emerged as the most important constraint . . . was the cost of finance. Around 90% of firms regarded this as at least `important' and of these 70% perceived it to be a `very important' constraint. </PARA>
<PARA>Remember, this review by the BIE was published in 1988 and drew on 1987 data; that is, the firms surveyed were only just beginning to feel the impact of the high interest regime imposed upon the economy by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> So we can validly ask: what is their experience now, three years down the track-three years of labouring under the world's highest interest rates in real terms? Even with interest rates falling off in the recession, real interest rates-that is, prime rates less consumer price index-remain at 10 per cent as at December 1990. This compares with 4.5 per cent in Japan, 4.1 per cent in the United Kingdom and 3.7 per cent in the United States. Is it any wonder our market competitiveness in the tradeable high value, high technology goods sector is eroding?</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs, as all honourable members would agree, to retain and build upon its scientific and technological skill base. It needs to invigorate the various research processes at work in the public sector research community. It needs to ensure that the structure and the physical resources which underpin those processes are adequate to the task. But the other hard policy work must also be carried out. I really do believe that the Government has to make some of the hard decisions that impact generally across the economy, but nowhere more so than in high technology manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the House must be reminded that in order for Australia to capture the benefits of its present R and D efforts, in order for it to capitalise on the body of existing intellectual property and strengthen the market position of its youthful high technology manufacturing sector, the Government must as a priority establish an economic environment which is conducive to those ends. There is, on the Government's part, a belief that these areas of activity are somehow separate from the economy. This is simply a convenient and useful fiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills are designed to provide funds to keep the programs of the Government running after the moneys appropriated last year are exhausted. They arise because extra funds are required as a result of new programs, and despite savings that have been achieved and were set out in the papers. A large number of programs are involved here and I rise to speak to only two of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to make a couple of comments about the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). By and large, I agree with his statement that the Government should-and in fact the Government does-place considerable emphasis on the development of new technologies. I spent five years before coming into this place on the board of a company that was seeking to develop new technologies and commercialise them. It was extremely difficult. Some of the remarks the previous speaker made were appropriate in pointing to the difficulties involved. We started from way behind the starting line in a society that historically has not commercialised its new technologies, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which is where our attention was devoted. </PARA>
<PARA> The management and investment company (MIC) program then in place was an attempt to encourage the development and commercialisation of new technologies, and we started off very enthusiastically. As we got into the business it became clearer and clearer that the lead times from an idea to a commercial application were much longer and that the percentage of such ideas that became commercial successes was much smaller than we had previously conceived. Some societies and economies have proved very successful at commercialising new technologies. I suppose Japan is the most startling example of this at the present time, but the Germans and the Americans have also had successes. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion I reached eventually was to some degree along the lines put by the honourable member for Gippsland-that we need to get the general economic settings right and to make the capital markets awash with capital to the degree that they are prepared to take risks in new technologies, which are very risky and very long term investments. There are a few other micro-economic policies that can be applied, particularly in the form of a fund of funds, which I think is a good idea if it can be got together. </PARA>
<PARA> The MICs as part of an overall policy setting are useful. But I note that, particularly in Japan, which has recently been the most successful economy in this respect, the new technologies have tended to be developed within arms of much larger companies that have a cash flow from lower level technologies. So typically one finds a large conglomerate engaged in the production of, say, newspapers, soap, beer and perhaps motor vehicles, which provide a cash flow, setting aside part of its annual earnings into high risk and long term investment strategies dealing with the development of new technologies. As a result of the five years experience I had in the field, that is a habit that I fear will take a longer time to acquire than I realised a decade ago. Nonetheless, I am encouraged by the fact that both sides of the House recognise the importance of getting that process under way. </PARA>
<PARA> I rose to speak about two other matters, the first being tertiary education and the Austudy program and the second our foreign aid. These Bills incorporate an increase in expenditure of $28.677m on the Austudy program. I note from the reports that are coming out of the universities this year that there is overenrolment in some of our universities. Nobody is very happy to see overcrowding in the facilities of our universities and nobody, particularly an academic or a former academic like myself, wants to see library facilities clogged and unusable, students unable to get the books they require, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> This has to be set in the historical context that a decade ago, when I was still working in universities, some universities in this country had considerable difficulties filling the quotas they had for some of their courses. Young Australians were not going on to tertiary education. The rate of completion of secondary education was very low, both compared with today and compared with other economies at a similar level of development. To compensate for that the Government has tried to undertake an expansion of university places. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is with mixed feelings that I now find that we have excess demand for university places. This is extremely good in that there has been an increase in the number of Australians wanting to go to university for training, but it suggests that, despite the massive expansion that has been undertaken, we have not been able to increase the supply of university places at a commensurate rate. I believe the Government should continue to maintain its program of increasing facilities and staff at universities such that the demand for places can be met. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to plan right now to avoid the projected 20,000 shortfall in the number of university academics by the end of this decade. I have looked at the study that projected the 20,000 and, with due respect to the authors, one of whom is an old acquaintance of mine, I think they exaggerate. Nonetheless, there is the likelihood of a shortfall of academics. We need to address that problem now and to increase the attractiveness of university teaching as a career. This will involve, as in all other supply and demand situations, improving the pay and conditions of academics. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that this is presently under review and that an agreement has been reached between the employers, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and the employees, the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations. The agreement is now being examined by the Government with a view to providing the additional funding that will be necessary to reach a satisfactory resolution. I hope this receives the attention it requires. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also expanded scholarships for students who want to stay on at university and who lack the financial support to enter university. Austudy has become an integral part of the expansion of that system. This appropriation continues the expansion of Austudy to students who need financial support to get to tertiary education. I get, and I am sure I will continue to get, complaints from people who feel they are entitled to Austudy but do not get it or are not to receive it because of the means and assets tests that are applied. Without committing ourselves to the existing levels of means and assets tests for all time, I think the principle does need to be recognised by everybody that the more lax the assets and means tests that are applied to the receivers of Austudy, the fewer poor children will be able to receive total Austudy payments and thereby enter the university system. </PARA>
<PARA> So the factor that has led to the higher than expected expenditure on the Austudy program, to the extent of $28m plus, is that the Austudy program has been extremely successful since it was introduced in 1987. It is expected that over 350,000 students and their families will be receiving assistance during 1990-91, an increase of 9.5 per cent over the previous year. It is also true that a higher than expected increase in the number of students receiving assistance means that $28.7m more will be spent on Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the number of beneficiaries is related to a number of factors, including the higher than expected enrolments in the tertiary education sector, to which I referred just now and which is to be welcomed; the higher retention rates that have been experienced in years 11 and 12, which has been a development occurring over the last 10 years, and one which I hope continues; improved marketing and information materials that have led to increased numbers of eligible secondary students applying under the scheme; an increased program recognition-and I note here that an Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls survey shows that the Austudy scheme receives the highest recognition among 15- to 24-year-olds of all government programs directed at youth; and an increased recognition on the part of students of the benefits of completing appropriate education and training before entering the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, while we come before the House to vote on whether an extra $28m should be devoted to this program, it is clearly a success that we are having to appropriate more money. It is a recognition of one successful step towards making the cleverer country that the Government is trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I should like to talk about is our aid program. In these appropriations we find that there are two different line items relating to aid. One is a saving of $6.2m in development assistance to South East Asia, and the other, moving in the other direction, is an increase of $5m in assistance for the Middle East. I should like to speak about these items together but deal with them rather discretely. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the cut of $6.2m in expenditure in South East Asia development assistance has been due not to a governmental decision to cut the aid programs, although that might well be undertaken, but to an International Monetary Fund aid program in Vietnam being postponed and to a Thai pilot equity scholarship scheme being absorbed under other headings. However, I would like to take this opportunity to make some observations about our aid program to east Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it very clear at the start that I am not against foreign aid programs in general. In some cases it is quite clear that they can produce economic development where it would not have otherwise occurred, or achieve a level of economic activity which would not have occurred without such an aid program. I suppose that the two most startling examples of these instances are Israel and Cuba, which until recently were the two most strategically dependent economies in the world-one very heavily dependent on a United States inflow of funds, the other on similar kinds of arrangements from the Soviet Union. Quite clearly both of them, by being underwritten by superpower programs, were able to achieve a degree of economic activity which otherwise, particularly given their military commitments, would have been very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, such aid programs do not always work and I suppose that, in the literature, the most commonly cited instance of them not working very satisfactorily has been in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been a major-possibly the major-recipient of international aid programs during the last decade but which, nonetheless, has one of the least successful economic performances of any region in the world, with what now would appear to be the exception of the Soviet Bloc, sections of which have perpetrated absolute disasters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the case that aid programs can achieve strategic advantage for the donor state that wants to achieve military strength in a particular part of the world and provides economic assistance to other states. I suppose that the most striking example of that is the Marshall Plan of American assistance to postwar Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Against these kinds of backgrounds, I ask myself what kinds of assistance programs we should be delivering in South East Asia-and east Asia, for that matter. It is very widely known that the economic performance and growth rates of the east and South East Asian economic sector as a whole have been quicker than Australia's. The Australian currency has slipped against many currencies of the region over the last 10 years or so, and many of them, or at least some of them, are generating large external surpluses and have now become major foreign investors in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the latest Westpac Bank survey of per capita income trends in east and South East Asia, including Australia, published in April 1991, the movement of per capita incomes has been significantly to the relative disadvantage of Australia, which still rates at No. 2 in the region after Japan but has slipped relative to many of the others, with the exception of the Philippines, as far as the open market economies are concerned, which has very badly slipped during the 1980s. In other words, many of the economies to our near north are producing very significant growth rates of economic development, some of which would be, to a degree anyway, our envy. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that in such circumstances, we ought to scrutinise much more closely the aid programs that we deliver to that part of the world and direct them either to strategic purposes or to emergency relief against natural and other disasters-which I regard as always part of our international commitment-or to specific projects with definable outcomes and/or diplomatic advantages; otherwise I think that the focus of our aid programs should be towards clear cases of need, such as Cambodia to our north, to the South West Pacific countries that are not having such success stories in economic development, notably Papua New Guinea, or to regions of great disaster, and I would include here the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The other region I would like to talk about is the Middle East, where we have been providing special development assistance over the last eight or nine months. I have received-I will not say a pile of letters-a steady flow of letters, phone calls and personal requests, since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in early August of last year, saying that it is a shame that we have had to get involved in this war, and what are we doing to ensure that the postwar world of the Middle East will be improved?</PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to say a few things about our contribution in that respect, before closing. We have, since August 1990 to February 1991, provided $5m in various forms of relief and aid to the Middle East. I note that on 9 April, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) announced a further contribution of $1m, which involved, on 13 April, a Royal Australian Air Force 707 aircraft leaving for Turkey with some 22 tonnes of relief supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> I might point out here that I had a number of offers from constituents, including notably the Salvation Army, to provide material assistance for the Middle East, and much of this had to be refused because the requirement at the time was for tents and for blankets and the offers that were being made particularly by the Salvation Army were of clothing. That gives a total of $6m that has been provided already, and we should note that the Government is, in addition, giving urgent consideration to identifying further sources of humanitarian aid, particularly for the Kurdish problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out also that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is fast-tracking about 100 longstanding Kurdish refugees in humanitarian applications; our charge d'affaires in Tehran has visited the border area where the Kurdish problem is involved; and our embassy in Ankara has been in close contact with Turkish authorities. In other words, as the military resolution of that conflict took place, alongside it Australia was providing developmental assistance and emergency aid to the people who were suffering partly as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but also as a result of the unhappy situation that obtains in the Middle East in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that the war is over, we are providing humanitarian aid and have been providing humanitarian aid to the situation in the Middle East. I noted that yesterday, when I had been contemplating speaking on these Appropriation Bills, I was intending to make some very critical remarks about the United States policy; instead, I will confine myself to merely critical remarks. The United States, I think, undertook essentially a just war in liberating Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. It then openly and very volubly suggested that the Iraqi people should rise and throw out Saddam Hussein, an idea which I, too, thought was very good. But having unsuccessfully undertaken that project in northern Iraq, they were left stranded in their hundreds of thousands across the mountains of northern Iraq where the Turkish military were denying them entry to Turkey, for reasons that I understand, and they were finding it physically difficult to gain refuge in Iran. The Americans' determination to wash their hands of the problem, given United Nations commitments to sovereignty of its national constituent states, was understandable, I suppose, but very much a shame and was a blemish on the otherwise very successful, if you like, finest hour of American intervention in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received again many phone calls from constituents over the last couple of weeks asking what the United States intended to do about this particular tragedy, and I was delighted to see in the paper today that the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Turkey are about to build what amounts to, as it is described here, `security enclaves inside northern Iraq'. I also notice that our mission in New York has made known our wholehearted support for such operations and our views in support of the development of safe havens in which relief can be provided for the Kurds and our exploration of the scope of use of provisions of Security Council resolution 687 to maintain pressure on Iraq in relation to its treatment of the Kurds, and we are actively exploring possibilities for further action through the Secretary-General. We are, in other words, undertaking aid in conjunction with the leading coalition powers from the Gulf war to try to alleviate the difficulties presently presented by the Kurdish situation, particularly in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say something about the shuttle diplomacy being undertaken by the American Secretary of State, Mr Baker. I would welcome very much the more positive attitude that the Americans have adopted towards the resolution of the Palestinian question. I spoke in the adjournment debate a couple of weeks ago on the urgency which I believe should be attached to the resolution of that problem. I am delighted that the Americans are giving it top priority in the post-Gulf war period, and I think that, as part of our continuing readiness to provide Australian development assistance and emergency aid for the Middle East, we should contemplate assisting in that fashion the resolution of the Palestinian question. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will implement one of the most significant changes to the Australian system of social security since the 1940s. It involves the end of the unemployment benefit (UB) program-a program which was created in a world very different from today's. It will see the introduction of a new strategy-the Newstart program-which will help us deal far more effectively with the pressing problems of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I do not need to remind honourable members of the urgent need for a program such as this at this time. We must not repeat the mistakes of 1982-83. Those who lost their jobs at that time were largely ignored. As a result, enormous damage was done to their skills and motivation and serious problems of poverty were created. When the recovery came, long term unemployment remained a serious problem that has taken many years of government effort to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA> The major changes which are introduced in this Bill build on the successful reforms of recent years which have received widespread community support and produced far more effective outcomes for the unemployed. The Jobsearch allowance for youth and the initial Newstart program for the long term unemployed have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of positive measures of assistance, and form the foundation for our new approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Newstart program provided for in this Bill is a wide-ranging strategy. It centres on the creation of two new payments-Jobsearch allowance and New- start allowance-which in turn involve new patterns of obligation, greater emphasis on training, increased responsibility for the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), and improved Commonwealth Employment Service/Department of Social Security liaison. </PARA>
<PARA> Newstart is a major step forward in the integration of income support with labour market assistance. We recognise that it is simply not enough in these difficult times to provide people with income support and leave them to their own job search. We have to find out why people are having difficulty in finding work. We have to think about their prospects, not just immediately, but in the longer term. We then have to make serious attempts at dealing with their needs through training and other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the keys to the success of this strategy, Mr Speaker, therefore, is the availability of labour market programs. The Government has substantially increased the availability of these programs for the long term unemployed in recent years. As part of the Newstart program, an additional $227m is to be provided for labour market programs until the end of 1993-94, giving over 50,000 additional program places each year. This increase will be supplemented by the $105m expansion of labour market programs announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March 1991 Industry Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Newstart program, we will not be repeating the disastrous social and economic policy of 1982-83. We will be working with unemployed Australians in the most effective way possible to ensure that they will share in the benefits of economic recovery. More than that, we will be working to improve the competitiveness of the Australian economy and its labour force. The Newstart program integrates social and economic goals in a way which will build on Australia's proud reputation as an international leader in social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In developing the arrangements for Jobsearch allowance, a major aim is to help prevent long term unemployment wherever possible-to deal with problems before they become entrenched. Recipients will be required to participate in a labour market program or vocational training if this is likely to improve their chances of finding a job. The CES will provide early intervention assistance to Jobsearch allowance recipients within the first three months where it is needed. There will remain a strong focus on helping young people, and the current arrangements for 16- and 17-year olds will be incorporated into the Jobsearch allowance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that Jobsearch allowees, like Newstart allowees, who start Commonwealth Employment Service approved training will continue to receive their Jobsearch payment together with the normal training allowances. Improving skills should be seen as an integral part of effective job search, particularly in the current economic situation. The change will help resolve some problems of interruption of income support that people have experienced under current arrangements when transferring from unemployment benefit to a training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> When unemployment benefit was first introduced, and indeed for most of the first 30 years of its operation, long term unemployment was largely unknown. For the last 10 years, however, it has been a major community problem. The introduction of Newstart allowance for the long term unemployed will enable us to meet this problem in the specialised way that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience has shown that the key to tackling successfully the problems of the longer term unemployed lies in integration of income support and other forms of assistance. Since the Government upgraded efforts in this area, with the first phase of the Newstart program, the results have been striking. Newstart has also shown that concentrated efforts, utilising options from a range of available measures, to assist the long term unemployed can contribute to useful employment outcomes, even for persons in receipt of UB for five years or more. No country has found this problem easy to deal with but the figures show that significant numbers of people can be helped. </PARA>
<PARA> Between February 1989 and December 1990, 134,000 persons in the Newstart target group left unemployment benefit. During this time, around 75,000 unemployment benefit recipients have participated in labour market programs which will improve their employment prospects. The proportion of the unemployed who are long term fell from around 38 per cent in February 1989 to 25 per cent in November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the arrangements for Newstart allowance, therefore, the CES will have greatly increased responsibility for the long term unemployed. Willingness to undertake training or take advantage of other program assistance will be a major condition of income support. The CES will, under delegation, administer the activity test for Newstart allowees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Newstart program will see assistance and requirements tailored far more closely to individual needs and capacities. A key feature of the Newstart allowance will be the activity agreement that recipients will have to enter into to receive the allowance. In each case, the activity agreement will set out the steps that individuals will have to take to improve their employment prospects. There should be no misunderstanding about this. The activity agreement will be a requirement for payment. If a person is not prepared to enter into, and abide by, an agreement he or she will not be paid Newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an initiative very much aimed at providing real hope and assistance to people. It offers scope to people to acquire skills so that they will be better placed when the labour market starts to improve. I should stress, however, that the Government is strongly of the view that acceptance by the community of increased obligation to help the unemployed must be accompanied by increased reciprocal obligations for the unemployed to take advantage of the assistance available and so help themselves. Recipients of either allowance who unreasonably refuse offers of assistance or make insufficient efforts themselves will have their payments suspended for a period, or cancelled. Jobsearch allowance for those over 18 will be available for no more than 12 months. Transfer to Newstart allowance is not automatic. These are firm signals that income support will be payable only where recipients' obligations are met. </PARA>
<PARA> The interests of the community will also be protected by continuation of the measures introduced by the Government in recent years within the Department of Social Security to reduce the risk of fraud and incorrect payment. The Department will maintain its efforts in this area through its program of interviews and reviews, computer data matching, mobile review teams and other strategies. Those receiving Jobsearch allowance and Newstart allowance will have to lodge a form in person each fortnight to continue payment. Compliance will be enhanced by significantly improved liaison arrangements with the CES and the increased contact with individuals that is an essential feature of the Newstart program. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Newstart program was announced in the February 1990 Economic Statement, it was estimated that the program would be a minor net cost to the Commonwealth in 1990-91 of $0.4m with net savings of around $12.13m accruing in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement of new labour market programs in the March 1991 industry statement and substantial changes to the UB parameters since early 1990 will change the overall cost savings of the program from the February 1990 estimates. However, net program savings are still anticipated from 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who would wish to deal with the problems of unemployment in a simplistic and socially and economically irresponsible way-by, for example, providing little or no program assistance and terminating benefits after a period regardless of whether a person has genuinely been able to find work. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, however, has no intention of making scapegoats of the unemployed. The necessary measures to require reciprocal obligation on the part of the unemployed and to maintain the integrity of the system should be seen in the context of the positive assistance and encouragement which will be provided. The Newstart program is intended to address the real problems of the unemployed and work in their interest and that of the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would also incorporate initiatives introduced during the Budget sittings 1990 that would impact on the payability of Jobsearch allowance or Newstart allowance or the rate of payment at which a person is to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It contains measures to extend normal mainland Australian taxation arrangements to the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Bill also contains amendments that relate to the measures enacted by this Government last year to deal with the avoidance of Australian tax through the use of controlled foreign companies and trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to the changes the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced on 13 December 1990 to the taxation arrangements for foreign employment income derived by Australian residents. These changes will greatly simplify a complex part of the tax system that affects individual Australians working overseas and will benefit, in particular, Australian missionaries and volunteer aid workers engaged in foreign service in a country that does not tax their income. Following consultations with the finance industry, measures are included to give effect to minor concessional modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the income tax law. Amendments to the land degradation provisions to give effect to the measures announced in the 1990-91 Budget arising from the review of Landcare objectives are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide for taxpayers to be able to claim a deduction for both current and capital expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1991 in the course of rehabilitating mining or quarrying sites. Amendments to various provisions relating to the quotation of a tax file number for the investment phase and to simplify the provisions of the Act relating to pensions, benefits and allowances are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will extend the taxation relief presently available for securities transferred between lenders and borrowers under securities lending arrangements. The gift provisions of the income tax law and the law in relation to the assessment and payment provisions for companies and superannuation funds will be amended. Finally, as part of its continuing commitment to the fight against organised crime, the Government has decided to extend access to taxation information to three law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures. In relation to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands the Bill will give legislative force to certain taxation measures that are part of a number of reforms to be introduced under the Government's commitment to give effect to the vote by the Cocos Malay people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to integrate with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, under the proposed changes, residents of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands will, from 1 July 1991, be subject to Australian tax obligations in respect of presently exempt income and capital gains. In addition, previously exempt fringe benefits will become taxable from 1 July 1991. These changes, the main features of which I will briefly outline, mirror those set out in a memorandum of understanding that was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and representatives of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands community on 7 March this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Personal income tax is to be phased in so that a tax in respect of previously exempt income and capital gains will be reduced by 50 per cent during the 1991-92 income year. Full rates of personal tax will first apply to such income and capital gains in the 1992-93 income year. As Cocos (Keeling) Islands residents already have access to Medicare benefits, normal rates of the Medicare levy will apply from 1 July 1991. Full rates of company tax will apply to previously exempt income and capital gains of Cocos (Keeling) Islands resident companies in the 1991-92 income year. Capital gains tax rules will now apply to all assets disposed of on or after 1 July 1991 by residents of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. However, in respect of previously exempt assets, only the gain which has accrued on or after 1 July 1991 will be subject to the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequential effect of the proposed amendments is that the residents of Norfolk Island will, in the 1991-92 and later income years, be liable to tax on income or capital gains derived from sources in the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the same way as they are presently liable to tax on income or gains from sources in mainland Australia. Revenue from these changes is estimated at $260,000 in 1991-92 and $750,000 in 1992-93, although this will be offset by other aspects of the integration package for the Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading of foreign source income, amendments in this area reflect the Government's willingness to act on proposals for the smoother implementation of these measures. In this vein, the Bill will exempt from Australian tax certain dividends paid by a controlled foreign company from income that has been taxed under another country's accruals tax measures, and will clarify that distributions from non-resident trusts that qualify for the rebate of tax on winding-up will not be subject to the interest charge. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, I must emphasise this Government's determination to ensure that these measures have their intended effect in countering tax avoidance. Some of the amendments will therefore streamline the provisions that were enacted to deal with tax avoidance through disguised distributions of profits, while others will ensure that offshore money lending businesses cannot claim excessive deductions for bad debts. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to taxation of foreign employment income, under present law an Australian resident person working overseas on certain approved projects, or otherwise as an employee, may be entitled to a full exemption from Australian tax as long as the foreign service is not less than 12 months, or a partial exemption for periods between three and 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The law also makes the exemptions subject to the tax treatment of the income in the other country, and requires complex calculations to take the exempt income into account when taxing other income of the taxpayer. The Government considered several representations concerning difficulties arising under those provisions, including the position of Australian missionaries and volunteer aid workers who generally receive only a modest amount of remuneration and were often disadvantaged by the existing rules. I am therefore pleased to say that the measures proposed in this Bill will provide a more generous level of tax treatment to these volunteers who contribute to Australia's foreign aid program by working abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concluded also that the variable tests and complex calculations under the existing law should be rationalised in accordance with the Government's announced policy of simplification of the income tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will therefore amend the income tax law to:</PARA>
<PARA> * extend the exemption in some circumstances where the foreign earnings are exempt from tax in the other country;</PARA>
<PARA> * reduce, from 12 to three months, the length of time a person must work overseas to qualify for full exemption-a consequential amendment will give a similar result under the fringe benefits tax law; and</PARA>
<PARA> * apply an average rate rather than a marginal rate to the taxpayer's non-exempt income and thus effectively reduce the Australian tax on that income. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to foreign earnings derived on or after 1 July 1990 and are estimated to cost about $3m in 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Thin capitalisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes minor modifications to the thin capitalisation provisions of the law which operate to limit interest deductions for Australian companies or other entities on borrowings from related foreign sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The first modification will exclude from the definition of foreign debt of an Australian company debentures eligible for the section 128f interest withholding tax exemption which are temporarily held by a foreign related party for the purpose of distribution overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other minor technical modifications will extend the existing thin capitalisation concession for a foreign owned resident holding company which partly owns a resident bank. The revenue effect of these cannot be estimated, but is not considered to be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Land degradation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The deduction available to primary producers for capital expenditures designed to prevent land degradation is to be extended to taxpayers who derive business income from rural land. The proposed amendment will allow both primary producers and rural businesses to claim a deduction for fences erected to separate different land classes in accordance with an approved farm plan designed primarily and principally to prevent the degradation of land, whether or not it is already degraded. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments, which see to fruition an undertaking given by this Government in its July 1989 statement on the environment, will have effect, broadly, from 22 August 1990 at an estimated cost of $2.7m in 1990-91, $4.2m in 1991-92 and $5m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Mine site rehabilitation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's 1990-91 Budget announcement that current and capital rehabilitation expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1991 is to be immediately deductible against income from any source. Rehabilitation expenditure will qualify for the deduction where it is incurred on a site where exploration, mining or quarrying operations have been conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional measures in the Bill will ensure that the rehabilitation process is treated as part of a mining operation for the purpose of deductions available for housing and welfare and plant or articles under both the general and petroleum mining divisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the amendment is $10m per annum in 1992-93 and later years. </PARA>

<PARA> These changes, which will have a negligible effect on the revenue, are in response to representations from investment bodies and investors and will lessen the administrative burden associated with the reporting requirements of the tax file number arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The law will be restated to make it clear that where a person makes an investment in a capacity as trustee he or she may quote the tax file number of the trust estate even though the investment is not held in the name of the trust. Further, the quotation rules will be streamlined where a person invests in an investment body through an interposed entity that is a solicitor or a body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA> Where all of the primary investors are identified in the investment made on their behalf by an interposed entity, the amended quotation rules will allow each primary investor to quote his or her tax file number to the investment body directly. If all of the primary investors are not identified, the interposed entity will be able to quote a reference number-to be called the `investment body remitter number'-instead of its own tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments proposed by this Bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to vary the date on which investment bodies must remit amounts withheld. Also, the existing exemption from quoting a tax file number where the income being paid is subject to non-resident withholding tax is to be tightened. The exemption will apply only where the investment body paying the income is actually required to withhold the tax, or would have been so required but for certain exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in this regard, the Bill will remove the requirement-which is technically defective-that a deduction be made where a tax file number is not quoted for certain deferred interest securities. It is proposed to introduce new rules in the Budget sittings to deal with such investments. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensions, benefits and allowances</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A project to improve the readability of social security and veterans' entitlements legislation by the use of a clear English drafting style and format is nearing completion and required consequential amendments to the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> In giving effect to these changes in this Bill, the opportunity has been taken to simplify the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act that exempt from tax certain pensions, benefits and allowances. The new legislation is intended to reflect existing policy and, accordingly, will have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities lending arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The existing concession for securities lending arrangements will be extended to remove the restriction that currently denies relief if distributions are made or rights or options are issued or exercised during a borrowing period. Relief will be available where lenders receive any such distributions, rights, options, new securities or a compensatory payment. The allowable borrowing period will also be extended to less than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments follow consultations with the Stock Exchange and other parties involved in introducing improved settlement procedures in the securities industry. They were foreshadowed when the Government introduced the concession last year, and will have no effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Company and superannuation fund self-assessment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to correct a technical deficiency in the assessment and payment provisions for companies and superannuation funds that commenced to apply in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision of tax information</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Access to tax information is already given to certain other bodies including all Australian police forces, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to communicate, in specified circumstances, taxation information to authorised officers of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales and the Crime Commission of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner will be allowed to disclose taxation information to the authorised officers where he considers that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence-that is, an indictable offence-has been committed. He may also release information relating to a person convicted of a serious offence for evidence purposes for a post-conviction proceeds of crime proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements of secrecy applying to taxation officers and other persons privy to confidential taxation information extend to officers to whom taxation information is to be communicated. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>

<PARA> The gift provisions of the income tax law are amended to reflect a change in name of the College of Nursing, Australia, to the Royal College of Nursing, Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will insert the text of those agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act. The agreement with Hungary was signed on 29 November 1990 and that with Kiribati on 25 March 1991. Details of each agreement were announced and copies were made publicly available at the time of signature. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and Hungary and Australia and Kiribati respectively. The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Conclusion of the agreement with Hungary reflects Australia's support for that country's decision to adopt democratic structures and move towards a market economy, whilst negotiation of the agreement with Kiribati is in keeping with Australia's recognition of the development aspirations of regional developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As with Australia's other modern tax treaties with such countries, the agreement with Kiribati provides for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by Kiribati under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. This means that where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives and is subject to Australian tax, a tax credit is to be allowed by Australia as if the Kiribati tax forgone had been paid. By this means the development incentives will retain their attraction for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries, as they will not be negated by Australian tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Each of the respective agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the last of the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in the respective countries has been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for that purpose. The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment and wider relationships between Australia and the treaty partner countries, but it is not possible to predict their effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91 provide additional estimates for a whole range of activities. In speaking to these Bills I will address briefly some of the issues that these additional estimates raise. I note that the additional estimates provide $32.2m as a contribution to the cost of the deployment of Australian naval vessels and personnel to the Persian Gulf task force and the vessels that took part in Operation Desert Storm. I am happy to support this appropriation, which forms part of a total cost of the Australian involvement in the Gulf war and the sanctions that preceded the Gulf war of about $100,000m, although as yet we do not know the total figure. It has to be understood that Australia played a very small part in that triumphant exercise, Operation Desert Storm, but we should never forget--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party says, Australia played a significant role. As a nation we did ourselves proud by participating in that exercise. Never let it be forgotten that all the alternative options that others put forward to us-and, of course, on a grander scale to the United States of America, Britain, France and others-were substantially worse than the option the world finally decided on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make three particular points about both the Australian involvement in the Gulf deployment and the more general issue of what has happened subsequently in that part of the world. As I said earlier, Australia was proud to make a contribution. We were very proud of the work done by our naval personnel in particular in that exercise. There is no doubt that they behaved with characteristic dignity in the best traditions of the Australian armed forces, particularly the Royal Australian Navy. They upheld the reputation of this country quite admirably. I understand from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) that we have present in the gallery tonight two naval officers who have just returned from the Gulf. I am not sure where they are sitting, but on behalf of everybody here I extend our congratulations to them on doing such a good job for our country. All of us appreciate what they have done. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As everybody would know, we sent two warships and we also sent a support ship. I make a handful of points about the totality of our contribution. I mentioned earlier that it was a small but proud contribution; but it was a matter of concern to me in the lead-up to the Gulf war when I learnt that there were so few ships in the Royal Australian Navy which had the capability to participate in that exercise. The ships that did participate did so admirably, but it is a concern-I was told by the appropriate officials-that only four ships out of the total Australian naval fleet had the appropriate close-in weapons systems to be able to make a truly useful contribution to Operation Desert Storm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia could have considered a number of other possibilities. Hypothetically, we could have considered sending some ground troops and some Air Force deployments as well. But regardless of the politics of this issue, regardless of whether it would have been right or wrong to send additional support to Operation Desert Storm, we simply did not have the defence capability to do so. We could not have sent ground troops even if we had wanted to because we would not have been able to provide appropriate support for those ground troops. </PARA>
<PARA> We could not, as some people suggested, have sent F18s to make a contribution, as I think Canada did, because our F18s are not properly equipped for that sort of work. In particular, in Australia we do not have the radar jamming devices used on comparable aircraft in countries such as the United States and Britain. We were asked by the United States whether we would send some F111s with surveillance capability. The Government, for political reasons, decided that it would not send those F111 aircraft. History will judge whether that decision was right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> My major point about Australia's contribution is that we had so few ships, and no other capability beyond those F111 surveillance aircraft, to offer to Operation Desert Storm. It really underlines the fact that the Australian Defence Force has been allowed to deteriorate over recent years as a direct consequence of Government policy. One could say that it is the primary role of any government first and foremost to ensure that the country is properly defended. Therefore its primary role is to ensure that we have an effective defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> My great concern is that our Defence Force now has insufficient equipment and there is low morale amongst Defence Force personnel because of lack of training and lack of career opportunities. Related to that, it has insufficient resources to be able to conduct appropriate exercises. Aircraft are not able to fly sufficiently on exercises. There is not enough money to pay for the Navy to participate in exercises. It has had to cut back its steaming time. Training exercises for the Army have become extremely limited. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that the morale of our defence forces has sunk very low. Over recent years the potential effectiveness of our Defence Force has been weakened. The prestige of our Defence Force, despite the extraordinary degree of professionalism and commitment of those in the Defence Force, is simply being eroded. In a military sense, in the Asia-Pacific region and in particular in the South East Asian region Australia has nothing like the relative position it had 10 or 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> That was one of the consequences of our participation in the Gulf war. It focused the minds of Australians and the minds of this Parliament, I would hope, on the inadequacies of our Defence Force and the need to reconsider the whole structure and operational effectiveness of our Defence Force. That is why the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) decided to establish an Opposition review of the whole of the Australian defence efforts, starting with a complete reassessment of the 1987 Defence White Paper, which is the basis of the Government's own defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point in relation to the Gulf war that I want to address involves this question which is much debated now about what the trade consequences of that war are. There is a view around in the Australian community, and certainly in the business community, that there are an enormous range of opportunities for Australian businesses to participate in the reconstruction of Kuwait and perhaps other parts of the Middle East. The Kuwaitis are in the process of letting a large number of contracts. As a result of that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Aid (Dr Blewett) visited Kuwait a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Austrade has established what it perceives to be a special unit in order to assist the business community in Australia to get some of those contracts. The fact is that we need to understand one or two simple points in this country about those contracts. In the first place, if we are to get any of those contracts-so far I do not think we have any; Telecom has a good chance of securing some, but beyond Telecom we certainly do not have any-we will need to make a much bigger effort than we are already making. </PARA>
<PARA> We have one or two Austrade officers who are based in Kuwait. They have a mobile telephone system which has been set up for them by Telecom, and so we have some capacity on the ground. The Government may think that is just terrific and will tell the business community what a great job it has done. In truth, we have to look at that in relative terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take Britain as an example. Rather cynically, before the war was over Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, took a trade delegation to Saudi Arabia to begin negotiations with Kuwaiti politicians and the Saudis about contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait. Just in the last two weeks, four British Ministers have visited Kuwait with businessmen-and women, no doubt-as part of a trade delegation. That is just to take the example of one country, Britain, which is making an enormous effort to get contracts there and is already securing contracts. As I said earlier, so far we have secured no contracts. If we are really serious about getting some of the business in Kuwait-the business that is available; perhaps there is not as much as people sometimes think-we will have to make a much grander effort than unfortunately as a country we are already making. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also add that in this country we think that because we participated with 27 other countries in asserting the United Nations sanctions, and also with some countries in Operation Desert Storm, that that would give us automatic access to those contracts. I can assure the House that that is not so. When I was in Japan recently, the Japanese were telling me that they did not believe they would get any contracts at all except where they might be providing services or goods, which they had the unique capacity to provide. The point is that Japan did not provide anything except money. They did not send any military forces whatsoever to assist, but they did underline the point that the countries that had sent ground troops in Operation Desert Storm were the countries that would get the major contracts-obviously the United States, close behind it the United Kingdom, maybe France as well and, beyond that, possibly Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth our while understanding that it will be very difficult for us to get some of this business because despite the very valiant and professional effort put in by our Navy in Operation Desert Storm, it is a fact that, for political reasons, we sent no additional forces and, for military reasons, would not have been able to even if we wanted to. Therefore, we do not have the capacity to get the business in the post-war reconstruction that would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point in relation to the Gulf war issue that I want to mention is the post-Gulf war arrangements themselves. During the Gulf war, the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill, and I, as shadow Minister for trade, talked about the need for Australia to be prepared for the post-war reconstruction process-in the case of Senator Hill in a political sense and in my case in a commercial sense. The response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) to our assertions that we should be doing more to prepare for the post-war environment was that we were premature. We did not know that the Gulf war would finish so quickly and so successfully, nor did Senator Evans. But it has to be said-I think history shows that we were not premature-we were right to be trying to encourage the Australian Government to take up many of those important issues as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the issue of wheat. We said during the Gulf war that Australia should negotiate with the United States to ensure that in the post-Gulf war environment Australia does not get wiped out of the Iraqi wheat market which used to take 10 per cent of our wheat exports before the Gulf war by the United States export subsidies or by dumping from the European Community. This passionate plea on our part for the Australian Government to talk to the United States about that contingency was ignored until much later, after the war, the Australian Government accepted the proposal of this side of the House that we should send a bipartisan trade mission to Washington to discuss the wheat issue in general. While we were in Washington-I was a member of that delegation-we were able to take up this issue, but very late. I think that if we had taken it up during the war our representations would have been substantially more effective. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this issue of post-war arrangements, the focus of the international community is, without doubt today, on the plight of the Kurds. In conclusion, I want to say a little about that. Before I do so, I would like to quote to the House a report which appeared the other day. I think it highlights the quite terrible situation that is now taking place. I remind the House that approximately 1,000 Kurds a day are believed to be dying and approximately two million Kurds would now have the status of refugees. Many of them are on the Iraq-Iran border and a smaller number on the Iran-Turkish border. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that this quote was rather heart-rending. In the few minutes left to me it might be appropriate for the House to be reminded of it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Six small bodies of Iraqi refugee children, wrapped in muddy wet towels, lay in the mosque of this border village today. </PARA>
<PARA> They had perished of cold at a makeshift camp overflowing with families who fled Iraq in terror of Saddam Hussein and who are now fighting to survive freezing rain and hunger. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Kill me,'' shouted Ihsan, a middle-aged Iraqi jostling with a soldier trying to push back crowds fighting for bread. ``Drop a chemical bomb on us. It is better than dying slowly like this.'' Two other bodies lay beside the dead children in the mosque-a man of 40 who died of exposure and a girl of 18.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many other stories such as that which we see on our television screens and would have seen this very night on our television screens. It should be a matter-I am sure it is-of great concern to this House that that situation should have occurred. Nevertheless, I think many people predicted that after the Gulf war, should Saddam Hussein have remained in power, this was likely to happen. Some people argue-General Schwarzkopf apparently did-that the United States should have, as they would put it, finished the job and continued to send American troops right up to Baghdad presumably to deal appropriately with President Saddam Hussein, but in any case ensure that he left the position of the presidency of that country and then there could be completely new arrangements made for Iraq. The trouble with that proposal, though-I do take the side in this issue of President Bush and Prime Minister Major of the United Kingdom-is that to do so would simply have been contrary both to international law and the United Nations resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been much better if Australia had taken the lead-or had perhaps encouraged other bigger and more powerful countries to help us take the lead-to ensure two things in the postwar wash-up: firstly, that the cease-fire did not allow the Iraqi Government to use military helicopters in the way it has done, because there was a ban on the Iraqis using military aircraft of the normal and conventional type but not on their using military helicopters, which, above all, have been used to destroy the livelihood of the Kurds; and secondly, that the United Nations cease-fire resolution included a guarantee for the Kurds and a guarantee that their claims would be properly recognised and considered by the Government of Iraq. It is a matter of great personal regret to me that the United States and Britain-and also, let us not forget, Australia-did not take the opportunity to make that addition to the cease-fire resolution of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> There was much joy when the cease-fire resolution passed through the Security Council. Subsequently, it was accepted in toto by the Iraqi Government. I am not sure whether that means anything, but at least in theory, legally it does. However, it was a tragedy that no guarantee was written into that cease-fire for the Kurdish people. Through these Appropriation Bills this country is providing financial support of $1m specifically to the Kurds, and in this Bill it is providing a total of $5m for humanitarian aid. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very sad that we did so little to ensure that the cease-fire resolution did something for the Kurds. When Senator Hill asked Senator Gareth Evans on 9 April whether Australia would consider that, Senator Evans simply shrugged his shoulders metaphorically and said there was little the Australian Government could do in the United Nations. It would have been nice at least to have tried, would it not? If we had, Australia would at least have had the pride of knowing that as a country we had tried to do something for the Kurds. It is disappointing that a Labor Government, which claims to be so compassionate, did so little when presented with that opportunity to do something for the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that I am glad that two naval officers from the highly professional Australian contribution to Operation Desert Storm are in the gallery for this debate; it is appropriate that they be here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's future prosperity depends heavily on our ability to lift our international trading performance. Arriving at this diagnosis is relatively simple; achieving the necessary improvement in the performance of our economy, however, is something else again. It demands a massive and sustained effort across all sectors of our economy and our community. A wide range of ingredients is necessary. There is a need for business leaders to critically assess where the genuine opportunities for Australia lie; there is a need for management to be more skilful and innovative; there is a need for labour to be increasingly flexible and committed to the success of enterprises; and there is a need for a government to create the right preconditions and do all it can to eliminate the roadblocks to greater efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most vital areas in improving our trade potential is the waterfront industry. The Government recognises that Australia's trading performance is determined not only by the price and quality of our products, but also by the performance of those sectors of the economy concerned with their delivery. It is for this reason that the productivity, efficiency and reliability improvements on the waterfront continue to be a major government priority. There has been much public comment in recent times about the level of progress in this key area of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda. There has also been much public speculation about the merits of pursuing reform through a negotiated consensus approach. There has been singularly little public discussion about any credible alternatives to the Government's strategy, apart from the celebrated comment made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to use troops on the wharves as a `last resort'. He did not bother to describe what would be the Opposition's first resort to improve waterfront performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The complete paucity of the Opposition's policy was revealed by the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), in a recent speech to the shipping industry. When asked whether the Opposition would have the guts to get stuck into the waterfront, in line with the Opposition's confrontationist rhetoric, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't know. George Bush said `read my lips' and he backed down. I can only say you're going to have to either trust people or keep voting labour. </PARA>
<PARA>That just about sums up the policy of the Opposition: `Just trust us, but be aware we will use troops in a brawl on the waterfront if it all gets too hard for us'. That really defines the difference between the Government's negotiated consensus approach, which is quietly achieving real and sustained productivity improvements, and the headline-grabbing `troops on the wharves' approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's waterfront reform program is 15 months into a three-year timetable, which provides for comprehensive reform across all aspects of the waterfront. It is based on the recommendations of an extensive two-year inquiry by the Inter-State Commission into the whole waterfront industry. At the time of their release in April 1989, considerable support for the findings existed among relevant interest groups. Even the shadow Minister for shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), described the report in October last year as containing:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a range of very sensible recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and:</PARA>
<PARA>a package of reforms that . . . were worth implementing and would deliver real and achievable gains for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the gloomy forecasts of all the doomsayers who want the Government's program to fail, waterfront reform is gaining momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> The movement to company based employment for stevedoring employees at major ports is well under way. The first enterprise agreement is currently being implemented at the two largest container terminals in Sydney and Melbourne, which are operated by National Terminals (Australia) Ltd. This agreement will result in a 34 per cent reduction in National Terminals' work force, with the exit of 460 employees by mid-year; some 350 employees left the company last month. This, together with the company's $60m investment program in more modern equipment and new computer systems, guarantees improved efficiency and customer services. </PARA>
<PARA> Other enterprise agreements are completed or nearing finalisation. The Union Steam Ship Company of Australia Pty Ltd recently forwarded agreements covering its terminals in Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) for assessment. The Authority is responsible for overseeing stevedoring reforms and must approve each enterprise agreement as meeting the Government's productivity targets before releasing any funding under the program's redundancy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the recent breakthrough in the Industrial Relations Commission, the agreement of Conaust Pty Ltd for its CTAL container terminal in Sydney is being finalised. This will open the way for other Conaust agreements to be concluded, covering nearly half the stevedoring labour force in major ports around Australia. These include Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle, Darwin and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> A program for negotiation of revised employment arrangements for regional ports is also under way. Supporting these changes is the development of a new stevedoring industry award, which aims to consolidate some 20 awards and agreements covering stevedoring work and includes a new skills based classification structure. Union rationalisation on the waterfront is being pursued under the auspices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It initially involved the formation of a federation of seagoing and stevedoring unions, which will receive recognition as the principal union in the port authority area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in a number of areas unions with a small membership representation on the waterfront have agreed to withdraw coverage in line with the ACTU rationalisation policy. The Opposition has been spreading the story that the Conaust agreement was progressed outside the Government's reform program because of the involvement of the Industrial Relations Commission. In fact, the in-principle agreement covering the stevedoring reforms specifically provides for the Commission to be involved in resolving any impasse between the parties in implementing the reform program. The Commission expressly recognised the relationship between its role and the functions of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority in its statement in the Conaust case. </PARA>
<PARA> Another furphy being spread about the reform program is that it is only producing a 30 per cent increase in productivity. Admittedly, the program aims at a net reduction of 2,000 employees in the stevedoring work force. This represents a 30 per cent increase in labour productivity. However, the basic structural and attitudinal changes flowing from this program, not only on the part of the work force but, more importantly, new management approaches, will produce substantial additional rises in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The national terminals agreement aims at productivity improvements in cargo handling of up to 60 per cent, which will put its facilities on a par with highly regarded terminals in Europe and North America. Reforms negotiated by the waterfront authority for the stevedoring of grain have produced reductions in labour requirements of between 50 and 80 per cent. The Australian Wheat Board recently estimated these reforms are saving the grain industry more than $5m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the recent comments of the Assistant General Manager of the Australian Wheat Board, Mr Tom Pile, about the success of the grain reforms under the Government's program. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think we've got a result that is faster in terms of the whole of Australia than could have been achieved by confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>When asked whether a more confrontationist style should be adopted by the Government, Mr Pile replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the answer really is that it does take time. You can't sit behind a desk somewhere and make a decision on what the work practice arrangements might or should be, what the manning levels might or should be, without actually physically going out and looking at the job being done. </PARA>
<PARA>How very true. Mr Pile was also asked whether reform should be quicker, as claimed by the Opposition. He answered:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there's a lot of people who have got it wrong, and I think there's a lot of people that are not actually trying to work within the process. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there's a lot of people who are making a lot of noise. I've heard people too that jump up and shout and scream and say this is doing nothing for me. The question really is what are they doing to get involved in the process? Very often, its nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reform program involves the comprehensive restructuring of all aspects of the waterfront and not just the stevedoring sector. Of course, the wharfies present an easy target and, if we believe the Opposition, they should get all the blame for our waterfront ills. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are significant areas of our ports which fall within the direct responsibility of State governments-namely, the operation of port authorities and associated port services. Port authorities employ around 7,000 people and have annual revenues of about $800m, which is of the same order as the much maligned stevedoring sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the reform program, the State and Northern Territory governments have agreed to promotion of measures to enhance port efficiency. These include establishment of appropriate corporate charters, setting financial targets, ensuring high level expertise on port boards, introducing user-pays pricing to encourage more efficient use of resources, and reviewing leasing and licensing arrangements to maximise competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important area requiring review is the interface between waterfront and land transport. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, under the chairmanship of my friend the honourable member for Shortland (Peter Morris)-who is probably one of the most able members of parliament-is undertaking an inquiry into the appropriateness, efficiency and performance of the links between ports and land transport. An area that the Committee has already identified is the need for rapid development of electronic data interchange (EDI) technology. The reform program actively pursues advancement of EDI which promises savings in the range of 3.5 to 5 per cent of transport costs, or some $100m to $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not regard the waterfront reform program as an end in itself. The program is being pursued because of its importance in ensuring Australia's ability to be an effective, reliable supplier to world markets. We have taken a consultative rather than a confrontationist approach, working with the industry parties rather than against them. This is the only way that long term, sustained productivity improvement will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing could be more destructive to the growth of this new productive culture than a period of massive industrial disruption cultivated by a confrontationist government. This would just rekindle all the old divisions and prejudices of the past. The resulting reforms would never be as significant as those achieved through the consensus approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thrust of the reform strategy has been the negotiation and implementation of enterprise agreements. Notwithstanding media commentary to the contrary, any objective assessment would conclude that the agreement negotiations are progressing well. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge the positive role that the Waterside Workers Federation has played under the stewardship of its very able and competent secretary, Tas Bull, in working towards a responsible, integrated port labour force agreement. Over a number of years I have had a keen interest in the developments and changes that have taken place, not only on the waterfront, but with the seagoing unions as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It may interest honourable members to know that in 1958 there were 26,000 registered waterside workers. Today there are 4,600 registered workers and another 1,600 members, such as shipping clerks and tradesmen, which brings a total of 6,200 workers into the industry. This has been a dramatic decline on the waterfront, and of course it further highlights the Herculean task Tas Bull and his union officials have had in selling changes to their constituencies. Surely the positive actions of Tas Bull and his officials deserve to be praised for their contribution, and we on this side of the House do so unreservedly. It is sad indeed that those opposite do not give that acknowledgment, but revel in the falsehood that the economic difficulties of this country are all the fault of the waterfront. What hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that in Australia both the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamens Union of Australia have led the way, particularly in the transport industry reforms, in positive structural reforms within their industries. It is indeed a pity that in other sections of the transport industry the same effective, capable, visionary leadership as shown by Tas Bull of the Waterside Workers Federation and by Pat Geraghty of the Seamens Union is not also there in other unions in the transport industry. We on this side of the House do acknowledge the tremendous work that Pat Geraghty and Tas Bull have done for reform in the transport industry, and I think we in Australia-particularly we in the Government-owe a lot to those two gentlemen and the unions they represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make some comments on the 3 cognate Bills before us this evening-Appropriation Bill (No.4), Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation Bill (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2)-I would like to add my welcome to our naval visitors. They have probably left the gallery now, but I would also like to welcome them, and to make mention, of course, of the arrival in Brisbane City tomorrow of the DDG HMAS Brisbane and the FFG HMAS Sydney on their way back from the Gulf. I am sure all of us in this House bid them a very kind welcome home, and I am sure their families are looking forward to seeing them when they berth in Brisbane River tomorrow morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I also say, first of all, to the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), before he leaves the chamber, that I cannot let the occasion go without making one comment about what he had to say, and that was particularly in relation to the reported use of Defence Force personnel on the waterfront, which was recently reported as a point that our Opposition Leader (Dr Hewson) made. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member that it is yet again an example of very, very selective reporting. We have to look at what the Leader of the Opposition was saying to understand its import in relation to micro-economic reform on the waterfront. I refer to one or two points the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made, I think very reasonably, including the question of stretch in the Australian Defence Force. That is something that I and others have commented upon in this place on many occasions over the past few years. I have often commented that we continue in this country to have defence very much on the cheap, and I do not resile from that comment. I have seen nothing in this place in the last three years, and of course in my 30-odd years as a serving naval officer, to make me change that view. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I want to concentrate on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and, in particular, the defence aspects of that Bill, and then to say a little about defence policy generally, with particular reference to today's media reports attributed to the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray and, quite properly in my view, well commented upon on this evening's television by the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, Senator Newman. </PARA>
<PARA> What then does Appropriation Bill (No. 4) refer to in relation to the Defence portfolio. As the honourable member for Mayo said, firstly it includes $32.2m for running costs, reflecting costs associated with the Gulf deployment, approved civilian and service salary increases and increases in certain allowances for Defence Force personnel. That, added to the $52.7m covered in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) only very recently, comes close to the forecasts of the Ministers in both places of around $100m per annum for our Gulf commitment. I say to both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) that the Opposition will be watching future developments to see whether that prediction is close or is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of that increased expenditure is $6.8m for defence housing, reflecting an increase in the capital subvention to the Defence Housing Authority as part of the Government's commitment to spend $750m on defence housing over 10 years. As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) said yesterday, the Opposition supports a general improvement in standards for Defence Force personal. In my view, the Defence Housing Authority is doing a very good job in raising those standards, in getting Defence Force personnel out of the ghetto conditions-that would not be too strong a word-that many of them have experienced over a number of years and, in the main, back into the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> The third element is $29.6m for defence facilities, attributable to greater activity levels due to economic conditions and price increases. That does not mean anything to me. I say to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, that hopefully the Defence Minister can explain that expenditure in a little more detail. Nothing I can find explains it to the extent that I think it should be explained in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we find a very large amount of $206.3m, which largely reflects adjustments for price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for Anzac ships and the submarine refit. Once again, I do not know what that means. Indeed, I would suggest that nobody in this place does at the moment. Again I ask that we be given a little more explanation as to what that means. All of this, including offsets provided from increased revenues and a reduction in the provision for contingent salary and related increases, means a total defence outlay increase of $181m. That in itself is a substantial amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this is coming before us this evening in a climate of increasing confusion on defence matters, not only in this parliamentary arena but up there on Russell Hill. In my view, the basic problem is fairly and squarely back with the responsible Ministers. There is a very serious lack of ministerial leadership up there on the Hill. Whilst it is very easy for us to be critical of the present incumbents, Senator Ray and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, one has to look further back than that to what has been referred to in the report I read today as the persistent shadow of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) pervading the corridors of Russell Hill. I think there is some essence of truth in that, and I quote from an article in today's Australian by Tony Parkinson headed `General cutbacks the order of the day'. I shall read a very short segment of what he had to say because I think it is relevant and quite accurate. Referring to Senator Ray, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is just over a year since he took on the job, and he is still suffering by comparison. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is no easy thing to compete with a legend. Beazley, who combined a long-standing and fervent interest in military matters with a ready ability to engage support and enthusiasm among the services (partly a result of his capacity to persuade Cabinet to bankroll a massive arms procurement program) still gets the vote of many a military man as the best defence minister since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very arguable point. Nevertheless, I think it is a very persuasive argument for the basic problem that exists up there on Russell Hill and, as a result, in these parliamentary corridors. In my experience, the Minister for Transport and Communications, the previous Minister for Defence, is an intelligent man. He has a very good comprehension of the national security strategy and other matters such as that. He obviously has the ability to compete in Cabinet when it comes particularly to large capital acquisition projects. He also understands, I think, the need for the defence programs to support our industrial infrastructure needs. One cannot really argue with the strategic need enunciated in the two-ocean navy posture. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would say to him, in all honesty, is that his approach in Russell Hill still lingers on and, as a result, they suffer in a number of areas. First of all, I think his administrative ability in terms of detail was questionable. He arguably very much forgot about people. We saw his overseeing of some of the largest resignation rates and departures from the service on record. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I say in all seriousness that he, in my view, politicised Russell Hill to an unparalleled degree. In fact, as many in this place would know, I was a long-serving senior naval officer, and I have to say to the House that one of the major reasons that I resigned, and perhaps one of the ideological reasons that I sit on this side of the House after winning the seat, is that I could not sit up there and watch that politicisation process take place to the extent that it did. It still goes on, and not only does it go on in the civilian bureaucracy-and many of those people know exactly whom I am talking about-but, I have to say very regrettably, politics and political pressures have been brought to bear in the uniformed area. I am not going to name names, but I think one or two senior officers sitting up there at the moment know exactly what I am talking about and are sitting there in many ways as a result of the pressures and the personal influence that the previous Minister for Defence had on Russell Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray, on the other hand, in my experience, is an intelligent man. He is a good public communicator, as he showed in the Gulf conflict. Of course, that was a day-to-day requirement that he had, a very pragmatic requirement. His role at that time required very little practical understanding of deep strategy, and I have to say to Senator Robert Ray that he did it very well. But I think-and again I go back to Tony Parkinson's article-that the time has arrived when that day-to-day understanding of what was going on in the Gulf is not enough, and that the Minister will have to come to grips in the next few weeks and months with some very large reviews, two very large reviews in particular. Again I quote from what Tony Parkinson said about Senator Robert Ray. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the coming weeks, Ray may well answer some of the criticisms. He now has in his grasp two important defence reviews which, in several respects, could result in reforms as fundamental-and more far-reaching at the practical level-than those achieved during the Beazley years. </PARA>
<PARA> The reviews-one into the structure of the defence forces, the second into how savings can be achieved by contracting out defence support work-will go to Cabinet late next month. Ray will then deliver a statement to Parliament, probably on June 6. </PARA>
<PARA>A lot of that lack of in-depth knowledge by the present Minister for Defence he is attempting, in my view, to make up with selective media briefings indicative in this sort of reporting. I have to ask the House and the Ministers whether this is all part of the softening up process simply because both Ministers perhaps do not understand exactly what faces them over the next weeks and months and, in particular, the implications of a strategic review. As the honourable member for Mayo has said, we on this side of the House, as a result of yet another initiative by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), are taking up the challenge. We are putting defence very much back on the political agenda and, unlike the present Ministers and, indeed, Mr Beazley, we do not see this particular document here, the White Paper entitled Defence of Australia 1987, as any sort of tablet of stone. In fact, it is there to be queried and, indeed, the Opposition defence strategy review group will be doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the article by Tony Parkinson, again, there is a report that all of the changes that are reported to be about to take place, unspecified-although, it would seem from leaks, very extensive-will be achieved without a fairly basic reassessment of strategic planning, and I fail to see how that can be done. In fact, Senator Ray is quoted as insisting that there will be no rewriting of the 1987 White Paper. Indeed, I have just been skimming the record of Estimates Committee B in the Senate two days ago and implicit and explicit in that evidence before the Committee is an indication that that will be the case. One particular point offended me and I feel sure that it will offend a lot of the very professional military people up there on Russell Hill. Let me just quote one thing that Senator Ray said in response to a question from Senator Durack. Senator Durack asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>For instance, Air Vice-Marshall Fennel made a statement just before the air power conference expressing his concern about the capacity of the Air Force to know what is going on and take steps in the air-sea gap, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA>I draw a distinction between a chief going out and calling a press conference for that purpose and, having called one for another purpose, answering questions on that. I see a different set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is reasonably innocuous. Then Senator Durack asked yet another question:</PARA>
<PARA>I really just want to find out what the position is. For instance, if one of the service chiefs were called upon to give an address, apart from giving evidence to an inquiry-you have answered that question for Senator Newman-on matters of major importance to Australian defence, that would be quite an appropriate occasion when they could speak frankly and freely, within the limits of security, of course. You have no objection to that?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have no objection. We have encouraged that process. The last thing we want to develop in the top echelon of the military are just simply puppets of Government. There is a degree of intellectualism there that often surprises me and I like them to exhibit it. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an affront to the professionalism of military personnel on Russell Hill and throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Opposition will be carrying out and is carrying out this defence strategic review. In the very short time remaining to me, can I just suggest to the House some of the things that need to be looked at. What needs to be looked at in that review is what the White Paper talks about-the area of strategic importance. That area clearly at the moment excludes some very major land masses, such as the Indian subcontinent, which in my view and many people's views should be included within such an area of strategic importance. We need to look at the area of direct military importance. We need to consider the budgetary situation, bearing in mind that this Government promised defence expenditure between 2.6 per cent and 3 per cent of gross domestic product-and what do we have in this current financial year but expenditure at 2.3 per cent of GDP or the lowest expenditure level in 40 years. Finally, we need to think very carefully about self-reliance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 4), Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), I want to address my remarks this evening to a range of industry activities but, to begin with, the shipbuilding industry. Last Saturday morning at Carrington Slipways at Tomago in the Hunter, the last vessel begun by the former Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd was launched. That vessel is the Searoad Tamar, which was being built by Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd for the Australian National Line (ANL). That day was a day of great pride. It was early in the morning at the top of the tide, a rather misty morning, but it was a day of great pride and a day of sorrow for the employees whose jobs will terminate with the completion of that vessel in about two months time, in June, when the vessel will be commissioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly this evening I want to say how proud I am of the men and women who have worked at Carrington Slipways-for their skills, dedication and achievement. I want to congratulate them on the fine vessels that they have built at that yard over the years, ranging from fishing trawlers, offshore vessels, tugs, the HMAS Tobruk and to this latest vessel, the ANL vessel, Searoad Tamar, which will provide a container service across Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> That morning, as I said, was a very sad morning. On 21 December last year the Commonwealth Bank, as mortgagee, was invited by the management of Carrington Slipways to take possession of the yard. The yard had reached a state of insolvency and the management invited the Commonwealth Bank to take over. The problems with that yard did not begin in December. The fundamental problem has been the same problem of shipbuilding around Australia-that is, it is either a feast or a famine; there are gaps between orders. It is related to the sparsity of orders and the scarcity of orders for the shipbuilding industry generally that has led to the problems that Carrington Slipways have had over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> In more immediate periods, the business suffered a serious loss on the construction of the Aurora Australis, not necessarily of its own actions, but originally beginning from losses incurred and delays when the company that was to carry out the design work on the vessel and whose use was specified in the original contract from P and O-the company was Wartsila of Finland, a world renowned firm in ship design-went into liquidation shortly after the contract was let to Carrington. The work that had been performed by Wartsila was inadequate and inappropriate. It had to be done again by Carrington. Carrington had to recruit the design skills to carry through the design completion and, ultimately, the completion of the vessel. In the process, the company incurred a substantial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of 1989 the company, through earlier borrowings and through pressure, came into a critical period when it sought with greater effort to find orders overseas. In July last year there were very high expectations that the company, in association with TNT Ltd, would be contracted to build four of the high technology wave piercing catamarans for use on the Yugoslav coast. That seemed to be at the stage where the order was going to be formally signed, always by next week. The company maintained its work force and maintained its skills in strong expectation of that order materialising. The fact is that it did not. One can look to Yugoslavia and the political instability of that country to understand why. One can understand also why the management maintained its work force in the expectation of receiving that order. That order was going to be a breakthrough into the substantial world market for wave piercing catamarans. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in the year the prospect arose of being able to build four Lady Hawkesbury class ferries for the Bangladesh Port Authority. Similarly, that dragged out and ultimately export assistance which was being provided in respect of both of those projects ceased. But in the case of the Bangladesh project conditions were set by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation that the company ultimately was unable to meet. So that order did not materialise. Again, the work force was kept together in expectation of one or both of those orders materialising. The fact is they did not. There were no other orders available in the near future that would enable the company to carry on. As I said at the outset, on 21 December last year the company invited the Commonwealth Bank to take possession of the business as the mortgagee in possession. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sad to have to raise this. Last evening in the other place Senator Tierney, a newly elected Liberal Senator for New South Wales, who is based in Newcastle, took considerable delight in lambasting this Government for what he tried to argue was its responsibility, as he saw it, for not salvaging Carrington Slipways. I want to go quickly through his speech, as reported in Hansard-that is the most accurate way to deal with it-and point out the basic inaccuracies of what he was saying. It is very clear from his speech that he did not know what he was talking about. He could not miss the opportunity to lambast Newcastle and the Hunter and attempt to lambast this Government. On page 2657 of yesterday's Senate Hansard he said there would appear to be a question mark over the persistence of the Royal Australian Navy with the Krupp sonar system that was to be fitted to the minehunters begun by Carrington Slipways in 1983. That is true. That is about the only thing in his speech that was true. </PARA>
<PARA> The sonar system was a dud. It finally resulted in the program of minehunters, originally expected to be six, to be curtailed at two. Navy has a case to answer for that. I have no doubt that at some later stage whatever happened in respect of that sonar system will be explored by others. In the meantime, my understanding is Krupp is still working on a system that will be effective in the Southern Hemisphere with different water densities, higher temperatures and a different seabed formation. When that sonar system is perfected we might look forward to a reinvitation of tenders for the minehunters. Senator Tierney made the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>If the faulty system had not fouled up the minehunter project, the project would have gone ahead for the other six minehunters that were originally planned and Carrington would still be operating. </PARA>
<PARA>That is sheer nonsense. The minehunters were being built in the fibreglass facility nearby to Carrington Slipways. It is not a part of the Carrington shipyard. It was to employ at most some 60 people in the construction of the minehunters. That facility, which is really owned by the Department of Defence, was already in mothballs. There is only a handful of people there minding that facility, waiting to see what happens with the sonar. That is wrong. On the same page Senator Tierney went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no doubt that Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) was offering the cheapest ship . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the contract was finally awarded to AMECON, but with the promise that some of the work would be contracted interstate, and especially to Carrington Slipways. </PARA>
<PARA>The undertaking and expectation of AMECON-restated by the Government-was that some $700m worth of Anzac frigate work would go to Newcastle, to the Hunter region. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Since that day not a single piece of work has come to Carrington or, for that matter, to any other shipyards in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA>It is coincidental that the same day he made his speech the announcement was made that Comsteel in Newcastle had won a $4m contract for the Anzac frigates. The story reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth steel company, Waratahs, won a $4m ten-year contract to provide part of the propulsion system for the 10 Anzac frigates. </PARA>
<PARA>That story is under the byline of Norm Skellams and Tim Isles, staff reporters of the Newcastle Herald. That made a mockery of the honourable senator's remarks that no work had gone to the Hunter. More than that, the tenders for the construction of the five hulls that are expected to be built in the Hunter, for their assembly and partial testing in Newcastle, have not yet been called. They are yet to be called. The program is more or less still on time, as was announced at the outset. In time, those tenders will be called and the opportunity will be there for Hunter firms to tender for the work that is likely to come up. Senator Tierney said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I point out that the awarding of the Anzac frigate project to AMECON will create work for the Williamstown dockyard in Melbourne for more than 15 years. In December 1990 the only major subcontracts let by AMECON were for the hull and superstructure units by its subsidiary, Eglo, in Newcastle and Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the work being done on the frigate contract in Newcastle at the moment is for the FFG class frigates. The vessel for which the sections are being built by Eglo in Newcastle is the HMAS Newcastle. It is not part of the Anzac frigate contract. How little does this new honourable senator really understand? He is plain wrong, but it did not prevent him taking the opportunity to lambast the Hunter and to lambast AMECON and all those associated with it. On the next page he says:</PARA>
<PARA>There was hardly any inducement to investors to become involved in the yard when their return was equivalent to leaving money in the bank. There is a real need for inducements for investment in this country in high-risk projects with the enormous potential of Carrington Slipways. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government, through shipbuilding bounty, has paid some $50m to Carrington Slipways over the past five years, some $28m of that in the last two years. Far from being a case where there was not any inducement to investors, this was a case where there was a considerable investment by taxpayers in the work being done in that yard. Unless the honourable senator wants to say that another $50m ought to be appropriated, and the Opposition cares to move in that respect, let us again expose the nonsense that this new senator is speaking. He went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA> Did the Federal Government offer any last-minute reprieve for Carrington?</PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the remarks-which I thought were splendid remarks and gave excellent recognition to the role of Carrington workers at the yard-by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), whose wife launched the vessel last Saturday morning. The senator stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) uttered a pious wish for a buyer for the shipyard, but he ruled out any assistance from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government and we, as local members-unlike the honourable senator-have been working with the trade unions, the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, community and industry organisations and other companies to interest a successor to Carrington Slipways in purchasing that yard. As I said, the Federal Government has already spent $50m in shipbuilding bounty on the yard. What we have tried to do is to encourage firms, but no government can compel a business to buy a business it does not want to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> The brick wall that all of us have come up against is that no company wants to buy a shipyard with 400 employees and an empty order book. There are a number of substantial firms interested in acquiring the yard and its equipment. It has excellent equipment. It has an excellent team of shipbuilders-a team of men and women of all skills. But it wants to reorganise and try to build up a better prospect of orders before investment takes place. It is my confident expectation that at a later stage there will be a successor to Carrington. We in the Hunter want that successor to Carrington there so that successor can tender for the Anzac frigate work when it is called. </PARA>
<PARA> The senator asked the very foul question in the Senate yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>Who in Canberra influenced the decision of the Commonwealth Bank to pull the plug on Carrington Slipways when the yard had assets in excess of $20m?</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the House that again the honourable senator does not know what he is talking about. It is a foul accusation and a reflection on the management of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank was invited by the management of the company to take possession on 21 December. It did not intrude; it was invited by the management. So again the honourable senator ought to put his brain into gear before he opens his mouth. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Anzac frigate contracts were being let and there was a concerted campaign from Victorian members in support of AMECON to win the lead contract, the Federal Opposition was mute on the Hunter. It was mute on the Australian Warships Systems tendering against AMECON. Not a word was heard until almost the eleventh hour when former Senator Peter Baume happened to blow into the area saying, `The Anzac contract ought to go to the Hunter'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have flushed one out. Welcome! It would have been nice to have known about it before. It is nice after the event, is it not? I thank the honourable member for Gwydir. It would have been nice to have heard from him. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) has drawn attention to the fact that the contribution of the New South Wales Government was to give its order for ferries to a north Queensland yard, on a minor difference in price. In net terms, after collection of payroll tax, it would have done better having that order placed in the Hunter region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In late 1990 the New South Wales Government invited tenders for a further five ferries. We have heard nothing more about that. But those five ferries, as the honourable member for Newcastle has pointed out this afternoon, would be a substantial incentive to a prospective purchaser of the Carrington yard were it known that the order was to be placed with that facility. But there was not a word. The honourable senator obviously forgets, as the honourable member for Newcastle says, that the frigate tendering process was quite public. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not know this until the honourable member told me today, but he says in his statement that at the time after the frigate decision, the shadow spokesman for defence indicated to him that he-that is, the shadow spokesman for defence-and the Opposition would be supporting the Cabinet decision to award the contract to AMECON. He intimated to the honourable member for Newcastle that he ought to do the same thing. So it is all out in the open. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not supported the Hunter region. We can go through a range of issues where it has turned its back on the Hunter. So this kind of sarcastic, hypocritical grandstanding from the new senator does not do anything to lift morale in the Hunter. We will fight through. We are a region that has a tough community spirit. We lead this country in industrial relations. We lead this country in the process of industry restructuring. We lead this country in the export of coal, the manufacture of steel and the export of aluminium. We will continue to lead this country in other products as we develop. But we are not going to cop this kind of cheap grandstanding from a new Liberal senator based in the Hunter who purports to represent the people of the Hunter and purports to represent industry and investors in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minutes that remain, I want to very quickly say something about the waterfront. The Opposition has an obsession with the waterfront. After many years, it has discovered that there is a waterfront and there are some problems. Those problems on the waterfront are being addressed. It took me four years as Minister for Transport to convince people that there was a problem. Most people argued that there was not a problem. It took the Opposition even longer to recognise it. But let me say to the House this evening: the waterfront is only one kilometre in a journey that can be 1,000 to 15,000 kilometres. The waterfront is a reactor. It has problems and those problems are being addressed. It does not manufacture anything; it does not build anything; it does not create anything-it provides a service. The waterfront is very much controlled, in timetables, by those who use it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make this call to industry in this country-to exporters, to importers and to the Opposition: lift your game. The waterfront reacts to the demands made of it by others. If we can level out the peaks and congestion on the waterfront and the use to be made of its services, we can get a far greater improvement in productivity than anything else. There is more to be gained in productivity improvement from users of the waterfront than there is on the waterfront itself-desirable, speedy and essential as those users are. It is very clear to me that the users of the waterfront are living in Rip van Winkle land. They are slumbering away. They are all hiding behind the wharfie shield-`It's a wharfie. It's a wharfie. Fix him up and everything will be all right.' The wharfie has a role to play, but the users of the waterfront-importers and exporters arranging their cargoes; those who organise the services-have a much greater role to play in improving the competitiveness of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say in good faith to the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) that indeed I did lobby on behalf of the Hunter for the frigate contracts-it was early in my days in this place-and I felt particularly that they were the right frigates for the job. The Hunter Valley, including the area into the southern end of my own electorate, could have benefited from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to turn to the debate on the Appropriation Bills and to a particular interest and concern at this time which relates to the Commonwealth meat inspection service. I note that there is a reference to an amount of $500,000 being claimed on the basis of the need resulting from reduced payments due to an unresolved dispute concerning levels of employer liabilities for meat inspectors formerly employed by the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday of this week the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) withdrew meat inspection services from New South Wales domestic abattoirs which had, for very understandable reasons, sought to protest against the gross inefficiency, excessive cost and amazing resistance to reform of the Commonwealth meat inspection service. The theory was that without inspection services, the abattoirs were not supposed to slaughter stock. </PARA>
<PARA> One abattoir at Cowra in New South Wales found itself with 180 men ready to start work and stockyards full of valuable prime cattle and sheep for slaughter. Not having access to its regular eight AQIS supplied inspectors, but being nonetheless in the happy position of being able to source two senior currently licensed inspectors-each of whom has in excess of 20 years experience, I am informed, and each of whom has been employed as teachers of trainee meat inspectors-the management of the abattoir thought it sensible to proceed with the day's kill. </PARA>
<PARA> So 131 head of cattle and 2,200 sheep and lambs were slaughtered and packed, the total value of the product resulting from this day's work being of the order of $200,000. On Wednesday, as I am informed, AQIS compliance staff appeared to inspect the product. They looked at the carcasses-I gather fairly cursorily-and, as I understand it, gave them a green light and commented to the effect that it appeared that the whole process had been well and satisfactorily undertaken. I understand that during the course of the day, as often is the case, three or four carcasses had been condemned by the two duly licensed and qualified inspectors who were there, but that basically there were no problems and the usual high standards of this abattoir were maintained and seen through. So, as I am informed, AQIS left the site and said, `Everything looks to be in order, but we will be in contact. Don't move until we are'. AQIS sat on the issue for 24 hours and then this afternoon rang the abattoir and told it that this very high quality, duly inspected meat was to be condemned. </PARA>

What is to become of these 131 prime quality beef carcasses and 22,000 sheep carcasses? AQIS says that they cannot go to commercial outlets. It has also said that they cannot go to charity because, in AQIS's view, the abattoir should not be allowed to divert the meat to the needy, the aged or the unemployed. So what is it required to do with this meat product? Make pet food out of it. The commercial value of this product will slip from $200,000 to $10,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may be a trusting country boy, a little slow on the uptake and a little slow to spot a conspiracy or a rort, but I think I smell one in this case. Could it be that this bloated, inefficient, costly, inflexible body called AQIS wants to maintain the enforcement of its monopoly on the rights to provide inefficient, costly and overmanned inspection services on the meat industry? Is AQIS perhaps more interested in maintaining these costly performance inhibiting jobs than it is in reform-the sort of reform that is needed to give the industry a future and to give the people involved in it job security and to develop job security and opportunity for their children in the future?</PARA>
<PARA> AQIS has a long history of inefficiency and high costs in the provision of meat inspection services. The problems relate both to the bureaucracy at the top end of the service and the militant and cost inefficient delivery of services at the bottom end, at the abattoir sites. I want to document some of these problems tonight. Lest anybody becomes bored and wanders off into the night, let me say firstly that this latest unbelievable exercise by AQIS, coming as it does on the top of a boiling over of frustrations in New South Wales domestic abattoirs, must serve as the trigger for action. Action has been needed for years. This must serve as the trigger for it. Real action from the Minister this time. </PARA>

<PARA> Cowra proves what is known by everyone in this industry-that there is a need, as a matter of priority, to review manning levels in this industry. If two inspectors can adequately do the job-and I believe that they did adequately perform that task, a task normally undertaken by no fewer than eight inspectors-is there not the need to do what AQIS is plainly unable or unwilling to do, that is, to get on with the job of an effective manning review?</PARA>

AQIS should be required to make a full submission itself to an inquiry, listing its objectives for reform, modest as they appear to be, and any impediments that AQIS is able to find under the implementation of such modest objectives.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precious little was done. Not only did the DPI say that of itself, but the then Minister for Primary Industry, the Hon. Peter Nixon, and the Royal Commissioner, Mr Justice Woodward, agreed with the assessment. Except in the last matter-namely, corruption-all of the inefficiencies and standover tactics are still applicable today, especially when we compare the performance of our inspection services with those abroad. I will come back to that later; it is very interesting, not to mention embarrassing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry was troubled enough in the old days when cost recovery was set at 50 per cent. Things got a bit worse when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) declined, presumably in response to a directive from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to move from 50 per cent cost recovery to 60 per cent in 1989. But still the industry struggled on, not wanting to run the risk of being closed down by upset and offended meat workers if they kicked up too much of a stink about the inefficiencies and the rorts that were going on. But then, despite the promises of Minister Kerin-reminiscent of wool and the reserve price scheme-that 60 per cent would be it and that there would be no further increases, last year the Treasurer, presumably, interfered again and it was declared that from 1 January 1991 the fee for service would rise to 100 per cent cost recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is about what it was. It was 68.37, just to get the maths exactly right. The industry's leadership reacted very strongly, and well it might have, because costs were to rise dramatically. As I have just told the honourable member for Parkes, they were to rise by 68.37 per cent-I hope my maths is correct; I believe it is-since abattoir operators, who had been paying previously $38,420 per year per inspector, were suddenly expected to pay no less than $64,686 a year from 1 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is really quite amazing. Any other industry that had on-costs in excess of perhaps 30 or 40 per cent might be regarded as inefficient. But this one manages something between 100 and 130 per cent. In fact, these fellows are charged out by AQIS to processors at $64,686 per year, despite the fact that their actual gross average annual salary is in the order of only $31,795. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where does the money go? Let us leave the vets alone for a moment; there is enough here to keep me busy for a moment. We will come back to the vets later. Of the total meat inspector staff of 1,654.2-this is a bureaucracy we are dealing with-1,249 are directly engaged in inspection activity at a particular time and therefore able to be directly cost recovered from industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, interestingly, 87.8 inspectors are deemed to be surplus to requirements and it is estimated that another 155 will become surplus within the next two years; they have been removed from the charge base. That leaves 162.4 meat inspectors who cannot be directly recovered from industry; they are the people who take over on the holidays, rostered days off and so on. They are recovered by way of loading on those inspectors who can be recovered, and the cost amounts to $14,200 per inspector per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we look at all the other costs. There are field administrative expenses. What do honourable members think they are? Are they the costs of going to have a beer in the pub? They amount to $5,432 per inspector. Superannuation is fair enough. There are Comcare premiums, leave loadings, regional office administrative expenses, and central office program administrative expenses. It goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry sought consideration for reform before the fee for service was increased. That seems reasonable enough. I understand that, for example, the Country Meatworks Association of New South Wales made very strong representations to the Government last year. In November, I think, of last year it wrote to the Government in very strong terms indeed along the lines that it felt it necessary to point out that industry was being required to pay for an excessive number of meat inspectors, some of whom work four to five hours a day, sometimes less than five days a week, just as they have done for the past 20 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Despite constant assurances that reforms have taken place and that further reforms are continuing in terms of the number of inspectors, plus undesirable work practices, nothing is happening. The realities are to the contrary, as people in the industry have been saying for a long time. All they are getting are promises, not action. The interference by departmental officers is such that the claim is that the slowness in reform is largely due to our members' failure to introduce satisfactory quality assurance programs. That is the claim. It is always somehow the employers' fault. AQIS, it seems, cannot cope with the militancies, stoppages and unacceptable work practices of meat inspectors, and their award restructuring discussions over the past six months-or 12 months or 18 months-have achieved little in terms of reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now the Government has decided to burden the industry with a total cost to employ public servants over whom they have no say in the workplace as to what work they perform, what manning levels will be employed or the initiation of any form of disciplinary action. The Government's decision to recover 100 per cent of meat inspection fees was seen by them, and should still be seen, as unfair, given that there was no effective industry consultation. It is unfair and unacceptable to hand a problem and a cost to an industry which not only is unable to absorb the extraordinary costs but is unable to do anything effective about it, especially when we remember that fee for service was sold to the meat industry on the basis of a 50:50 contribution. It was moved all the way up to 100 per cent cost recovery without any effective implementation of the promised but never delivered reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, nothing happened and the charges were duly introduced on 1 January of this year. Let us take a few moments to look at how inefficient we are compared with our competitors abroad. At the moment, the Minister is running around the countryside, as I understand it, saying that our charges in Australia are roughly comparable with what New Zealand processors have to pay. I have some figures that show the difference between a comparable processing works in New Zealand and one in New South Wales. They both process around 84,000 head of cattle a year. The New Zealand one, which is United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and European Commission (EC) listed, employs a total of six inspectors-one vet, one senior inspector and four inspectors. It costs them $2.29 per head or, in Australian dollar terms, $193,148 per annum. A similar works in Australia with the same number of head of cattle processed which is USDA listed but not listed for the EC has no fewer than ten inspectors. It costs $8.70 in this particular works for inspection charges for each beast, and a total of $730,816 per annum. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr Nehl</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and the Minister is claiming, as I understand it, out in the field that there is some comparability between the cost of these services in New Zealand and Australia. Maybe these figures are not as accurate as they might be, but if they are not we had better have an inquiry to find out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then move to the United States of America. That is even more interesting. I will give honourable members a bit of an idea about what happens in America. Running through some of these figures, one American abattoir slaughters 2,640 beasts weekly and has two slaughtermen on the floor. The number of carcasses inspected per inspector is 1,320. The equivalent in Australia is 385. In another example, 1,590 in America; in Australia, 200 to 233. In yet another example, 1,875 in America; 500 in Australia. We are talking about an efficiency differential of 3 : 6 against us, and we have to compete with the Americans in the Asian markets, where they are very intent on pushing us out. </PARA>
<PARA> The move to 100 per cent cost recovery has focused attention on these rorts and inefficiencies. That is a good thing; well it might. My abattoir in Gunnedah has had its government-imposed costs rise by $1.1m over the past 12 months, and $600,000 of that is the result of the Commonwealth meat inspection 100 per cent fee for service. It is not just a matter of overmanning. As I have indicated, work practices need looking at. First, there is lapping. In almost any chain in Australia, if there are eight meat inspectors, four will be working and four will be in the smoko room, and every so often they swap. It is not allowed for in the award. </PARA>

The boilover last week in New South Wales in the face of all this was not surprising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have corrected one of the Minister's statements. We are not by any means as efficient as other countries. Further, the Minister said that reform is under way. He cited the fact that in the past few years 600 meat inspectors have gone. He should keep in mind that many abattoirs have closed. The reality is that a survey has established that, of the 20 major abattoirs in New South Wales, none has fewer inspectors than it had 18 months ago and some have more.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us return to Cowra, since it is the trigger for everything I am saying tonight. I am sure that, when the community hears about this, like me it will take a lot of convincing that this is about ensuring safe, hygienic quality meat and not about preserving industrial muscle, bloated bureaucracy, inefficient rorts and jobs for the boys. Just remember: $200,000 worth of mostly prime quality meat is to be scrapped as dog food worth $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only touched on the myriad issues that I wanted to talk about tonight, suffice to say that there can be no excuse for avoiding a full inquiry. That full inquiry should be directed towards developing an efficient, perhaps corporatised, structure that will allow for relevant on-site employment contracts, perhaps involving a reformed AQIS, plant operators and inspectors, but nonetheless an efficient and accountable system. Now is the time for action. This Government talks about picking winners, but it seems that it cannot even get out of the way and stop obstructing the few winners we do have, let alone presume to be able to pick the winners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 4)1, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). In the limited time I have available I would like to touch on a particular area of concern to my electorate. Of the $274.4m being allocated in these Appropriation Bills, of particular interest is the amount of money being allocated for natural disaster and restoration. The $75m being sought would bring the total Federal allocation for natural disaster relief for this financial year to $155m. Some $90m of this money will go to New South Wales following the widespread cyclones and flooding since March 1990 to help in the restoration of the central State and community infrastructure and to help the people who suffered personal hardship and distress during the floods, as well as many small business people and farmers. The problem of flooding has always been of great interest to me because this issue has affected my electorate for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to point out that I believe that the Government should be commended for its sensitivity and its support for people who suffer as a result of natural disasters, such as those people who were caught up in the floods along eastern Australia during 1990. However, if more money was spent on effective flood mitigation programs, in many instances the disaster of flooding would not be so severe and could even be prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate in September 1990 on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I mentioned that one of the most important areas which needed assistance within my electorate was flood mitigation. I said then that the increase of 23 per cent for the flood mitigation program's budget for 1989-90 was not enough to overcome some of the major flooding problems in Sydney's west and particularly within my electorate. I also said that the severity of the problem in the Prospect electorate warranted a significantly increased financial commitment. I still stand by those statements today. </PARA>
<PARA> From the 1990-91 Budget, $450,000 was allocated to my electorate for bank stabilisation and restoration work at Lansvale, following the three major floods in Fairfield city between August 1986 and April-May 1988. The sum of $90,000 was also allocated for channel improvements in the Prospect and Orphan School creeks areas. From estimates in a flood management strategy study of the Lower Prospect Creek in May 1990, solutions to the problem faced by this area alone would cost $33m. At the level of funding my electorate is currently receiving, it will take a very long time to achieve even the most fundamental changes that are required to overcome the flooding problems within the Prospect electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The catchment area of Prospect Creek is one of the largest urbanised catchments in Australia and 97 kilometres of Fairfield city falls within that area. Prospect Creek drains into the Georges River, which forms Fairfield's south-eastern boundary. Cabramatta Creek, which is another major tributary draining a large area of Liverpool city, forms the city's southern boundary. The combined effect of flooding from the Georges River and these two creeks results in serious problems for residents and businesses, particularly in the Lower Prospect Creek flood plain and the Lansvale peninsular adjacent to the Georges River. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why several areas within my electorate are prone to flooding, according to a presentation report by Fairfield City Council to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in December 1990. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Fairfield City is characteristically flat . . . The soils of Fairfield are primarily heavy clays which exhibit poor drainage and have a low absorption capacity. These qualities accentuate run-off and exacerbate local flooding. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased urbanisation and industrial development in the upper catchment areas could create additional--</PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed) I find it absolutely astounding, as the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) would realise, that he called the quorum on me when I was trying to get the concerns of my electorate into about 10 minutes. I now have less time than that but I will make sure, as was suggested to me by my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), that the people in his electorate are circulated with the concern he has for ordinary people in flood mitigation areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to continue with one part of the report that was submitted which is urgent in my particular area. In August 1986 and April-May 1988 major flooding occurred along Prospect Creek. These floods caused serious financial losses and hardship to a large number of families and businesses. The 1986 flood caused total damage of approximately $4.8m on Prospect Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 serious and extensive damage was caused as a result of the flooding of the Georges River and its tributaries at Canley Vale, Carramar and Lansvale. Almost 700 dwellings and more than 30 factories were flooded above floor level, with some homes inundated to depths exceeding two metres. Also during this flood, 550 people were rescued by the State Emergency Service. Flood levels on the Georges River were equivalent to a one-in-20 years, or 5 per cent probability flood. If it had been a one-in-100 years, or one per cent probability flood the levels would have been over a metre higher and twice as many homes and businesses would have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA> If a one-in-100 years flood of the Lower Prospect Creek were to occur today it is estimated that 822 properties would be inundated, some to a depth of three metres; 637 houses and 57 non residential buildings would be flooded above floor level; there would be a total potential flood damage of $15.1m; transport would be paralysed by the flooding of the Hume Highway at Lansvale; early flooding of low lying roads would occur, preventing evacuation by road for over 200 properties; and 50 home units would be flooded at Carramar where ground floor exits would be inundated by floodwater putting residents at serious risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, to set the minds of the residents who would be affected by such a flood at ease, and to prevent a large scale disaster if a one-in-100 years flood were to occur, it is necessary for all levels of government to address this problem immediately. Fairfield City Council, for instance, needs more money to be able to carry out its flood mitigation strategies effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Council, these strategies are to develop and implement a flood plain management plan to reduce the impact of mainstream flooding; control new development to minimise the impact of urban run-off into existing drainage systems; improve consultation with external authorities on proposals which may have adverse downstream implications for Fairfield city; improve public awareness on flooding issues, including emergency procedures; maintain and improve existing and new drainage systems to ensure that flooding problems are not aggravated; and ensure that the design of the flood mitigation works recognises the role of open space and takes into consideration visual impact in public places. </PARA>
<PARA> Two solutions to the problems of flooding which are being implemented under the Council's flood plain management strategy are the voluntary purchase and the house raising schemes, both of which require substantial funding from the State and Federal governments. The four-year rolling program for voluntary purchase was established in Fairfield in 1987. The scheme's implementation involves targeting blocks of properties in hazardous flood affected areas and demolishing them. Following the adoption of the flood plain management plan for Lower Prospect Creek in May 1990, the number of properties identified as eligible for voluntary purchase has now increased from 29 to 88. The number of properties purchased and demolished to December 1990 totals 29. </PARA>
<PARA> In some sections of our community this approach has been very successful, and in others it has led to less success, as some long established residents prefer to stay in their existing homes than to relocate to flood free areas. This may be because the cost and social changes involved in relocation often outweigh the flood hazard, particularly for those residents who have learned to live with flooding problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidising of house raising is another viable flood proofing option which is being pursued in some areas. The submission for increased Commonwealth financial assistance for the New South Wales flood mitigation program for 1988-93 states:</PARA>
<PARA>In many of the older flood prone areas the dwellings are typically timber framed on pier foundations. These dwellings can be readily and economically raised above flood, thereby flood-proofing the dwelling without dislocating the residents and disrupting the amenity of the local area. This option is particularly attractive in flood fringe areas where flows and velocities are unlikely to cause structural damage. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the discussion paper entitled, `Review of Floodplain Management Practice in New South Wales', dated May 1989, the house raising scheme implemented 25 years ago has come under repeated criticism from potential users, some councils and the flood mitigation executive, because of its apparently limited availability. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the scheme, which was originally administered by the State Bank of New South Wales but was taken over by the State Government in January 1990, and is now administered by the New South Wales Rural Assistance Board, loans are available for up to 90 per cent of the cost of raising or relocating homes above flood level, subject to a ceiling amount of $10,000. The loans carry a maximum term of 15 years and currently have an interest rate of 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time that I have left I wish to say that, clearly, all the submissions that have been given to me and to many government areas combine into one thing: we can control some of the flooding problems in our area. It is clear that money is urgently needed for flood mitigation works. I believe it is important to recognise that there is a problem out there, and many people who can ill afford to change their circumstances are unnecessarily suffering time and again from floods. Although this Government has been supportive of funding for flood mitigation works, it is fast becoming obvious that if a flood disaster is to be prevented from occurring again, particularly in western Sydney, more funding from all levels of government is needed. I will continue my remarks when we resume this debate on the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I want to make the observation that the behaviour today of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the House sank to new depths. It is interesting to watch him performing and to observe his personal attacks, which he seems to mount from day to day on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Those two honourable members are poles apart, not only in the opinion polls but also in their abilities, capacities and intellect and just about every measure I can imagine. I know the Leader of the Opposition does not need to me to stand up and defend him. What I want to do tonight is read a poem. I might say it is not Keats or Tennyson. It was written by Mr Kuchel, from Robina on the Gold Coast, who sent it to me. He did not name it, but I will name it `Ode to Australia':</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That work was sent to me by Mr Trevor Kuchel of Robina on the Gold Coast. As I said, it is not Keats or Tennyson. I am told it lacks a little in terms of rhyme and metre. However, it laments, as most Australians are doing these days, the way our country has gone since 1983. It has taken a few short years to see Australia go down to the point where many people, whether through poetry or in some other way, are expressing great disappointment with what the Hawke Government has achieved. </PARA>

I hope we do not behave in that way, but we will have the opportunity to point to everything honourable members opposite have done over the past 10 years. Just about everything they did in what will be 10 years by 1993, we will be able to say represented great failure and that during that time this country, on just about every possible score, went backwards. That is what we will say. Honourable members opposite will have to live that down in this place day after day. I thank Mr Kuchel for sending me that poetry--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Stirling)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.35)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter that concerns me and I am sure would concern many colleagues in this chamber, yourself included, Mr Speaker. I refer to a matter that arose and was adjudicated upon in the common law division of the New South Wales Supreme Court, concerning a case involving two rugby league players, Mark Bugden of the Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League club and Steve Rogers of the Cronulla-Sutherland club.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, it was a common law action taken by Rogers against Bugden. Both were professional rugby league players; the claim was for personal injury arising by assault on the field. Incidentally, it was determined by the court that negligence was not applicable; however, compensatory damages were awarded jointly against each defendant-in this case against the first defendant, Mark Bugden, and the second defendant, the Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League Club. The club was held vicariously liable for the acts of the employee-that is, Mark Bugden-and exemplary damage tests were applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of the case was that $68,154.60 was awarded, plus costs entered for judgment, and the costs until 9 April this year were $242,000. I might add that clearly the lawyers have been in for their chop, because for the amount of money that Steve Rogers actually got-some $68,000-they have done a lot better. It is not the only time that I find that lawyers act as what one might call `parasites' upon the community. In this case I find the amount of costs awarded quite appalling. Clearly justice was done, but that cost was excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I rise to speak on this matter. What we are now facing is a series of cases in both major codes in Australia. As the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) would be aware, there is a case in Australian rules football which involves Rodney Grinter of the Melbourne Football Club and Terry Wallace of the Footscray Football Club, in which it is alleged by Wallace that Grinter engaged in an action of assault on the field. Wallace, incidentally, is claiming $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> When we approached the football clubs around Australia they said, `We are not responsible, because in effect we don't authorise the player to go out and do that'. This case, however, gives the lie to that, because this case suggests that, yes, the player is authorised to go out on the field and to play the game hard, so to speak, and if an action occurs outside the rules, which in fact this case does determine, unless the club demonstrates some other way in which it no longer has responsibility for the player-that is, he has been removed from the training squad or his rights as an employee have been taken away-in fact the club is still responsible for the player. While the players remain on the club's training list or they attend and they have the potential to be selected, the club is still responsible. The club itself would have to fine the player and expel him from the list in order to remove its liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of this is that we could well see football clubs in both major codes-rugby league and Australian rules-made bankrupt. If one takes $300,000 out of a club like Canterbury Bankstown, that is a large amount of money. When one recognises that a club like Fitzroy, for example, is trying to rescue itself and needs a sum of, I think, $500,000-it may even be $1m-by June, one realises that these are extraordinary amounts of money. We need a way to insure against this. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to clubs for some time about this matter. Sports people are precluded from workers compensation Acts; they were taken out because it was the view that the employers could not afford the premiums. Either they could be brought back under workers compensation, which would have to be done by State governments, or there could be, as a second possibility, a common pool insurer, such as the Government Insurance Office of New South Wales, which would offer to have a one-in, all-in policy, rather like motor vehicle insurance. Then a reduced rate premium could be offered for football clubs in exchange for cheaper ground advertising for organisations such as the GIO. </PARA>
<PARA> So the same would apply in the AFL as in the Rugby League, and it seems to me that if we want to obviate this possibility in the future, of clubs being bankrupted by actions like this, we need to go this way. I would conclude by saying that it would be futile for club officials to say it will not happen again. With videos now, with the capacity to have brain scans done, with people recognising that their professional careers can be at risk, the chance of a repetition of the Bugden Rogers case is quite significant. I might add, incidentally, we have also had the Malcolm Johnson case in racing. So what we have now opened up is very much a significant area of litigation in sport. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table has five columns in it. The first column shows the Vines recommendations. They are based on assumptions that we will sell 900 million kilograms of wool next year at an average greasy price of 288c per kilogram. It also acknowledges that there are 821 million kilograms in the stockpile, and that we will be borrowing at 11.75 per cent. If that is followed through, then the total levy that would need to be paid to service the debt and to have promotion, research and development et cetera, would bring the levy to about 21 per cent. Of course, that would cripple growers, so Vines has recommended that the taxpayer kick in $250m, which would bring the levy down to about 12 per cent. But even that levy would be an impost on growers, such that 25 per cent of growers could almost go to the wall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have looked again at these figures, and we have come up with the second column. By selling off $120m of the Australian Wool Corporation's assets, most of them based in Melbourne, and with the more favourable borrowing percentages that we have, the levy could come down to 14 per cent without any taxpayer input at all-without that $250m input. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, if we went on and not only did that, but also slaughtered 10 million sheep by continuing the program of slaughter that is in place now, we could knock another 45 million kilograms of wool, with an average cut of four and a half kilograms per sheep, out of the market next year, and still sell the 900 million kilograms that Vines says we can sell by taking 45 million kilograms from the stockpile. If we did that-which would be worth about $130m-the levy would come down from 14 per cent to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in the fourth column, if we go further and knock out 20 million sheep in a wool reduction or slaughter program, that would take 90 million kilograms out of the market. It would mean that we could sell 90 million kilograms from the stockpile and still sell 900 million kilograms in total. With the $120m asset sales, it would mean-remarkably-that the levy on wool growers could come down to 5 per cent without one dollar coming from the taxpayer's pocket. That is quite remarkable indeed. There is another scenario in the final column which says that if we use some of that money to pay off $70m of the debt, the levy would be only 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and those others in the leadership group who worked on it, and in the primary industry committee, and in fact the coalition as a whole for what they have come up with. This is a magnificent initiative which gives growers some hope. They have all been out there trying to balance their budgets, fearful that they will have to pay at least a 12 per cent tax next year. We have to remember they will not have the supplementary payments next year, and if that is the case, as I say, 25 per cent will be in dire trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> But with this coalition initiative that has come forward, I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will consider it very carefully because it gives great hope to the growers: it gives great hope to the wool industry. It will send a signal to buyers around the world that we mean business in this country, that the wool growers can stay viable, and that the industry has a future. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably the most exciting initiative that has come out of this whole 18-month-old dreadful wool debate we have been going through where gloom and doom have been preached. If something like this is put in place, the industry can go forward and continue to contribute to Australia as it has done for the last 200 years. </PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Badgerys Creek Airport</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Prospect)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a speech in the New South Wales Parliament on 13 March 1991, and in a press release the following day, the State Liberal member for Minchinbury, Anne Cohen, claimed that the proposed Badgerys Creek Airport in Sydney's west would be an environmental disaster resulting in air pollution, and, I quote her words, `equal to the worst American cities'. Mrs Cohen also claimed that the results of the recently released pilot air quality study for western Sydney indicated that the environmental impact study (EIS) on Badgerys Creek Airport was, in her words again, `totally flawed, out of date and lacked relevant data'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The member also said that the development of Badgerys Creek Airport must not begin until an updated EIS had been produced and pollution control measures were put in place. I refute Mrs Cohen's claims and suggest that she study her facts a little better before she makes official statements such as these to State Parliament and to the media about Badgerys Creek Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Cohen's claim that Badgerys Creek Airport would be an environmental disaster is totally unfounded. The air quality study done for the second Sydney Airport site selection EIS included the development of an inventory of total annual airport related emissions, both from within and outside the Badgerys Creek Airport site based on the long term, ultimate development scenario. The EIS considered the impact of airport related emissions for Sydney pollution levels, taking account of meteorological dispersion patterns to the extent that these were known at the time of the study. The EIS found that airport related emissions would not add significantly to air pollution levels, any more than would major new shopping centres, recreation centres or any other major commercial development. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Mrs Cohen's claims that the recent pilot air quality study showed that the EIS was flawed and out of date, they are laughable. The findings of this pilot study were consistent with those of the second Sydney Airport site selection EIS. In fact, it is likely that the study overemphasises the impact of Badgerys Creek Airport relative to future industrial development in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilot air quality study for western Sydney was jointly funded by the State Department of Planning and the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Communications, and the study's objectives were to give an overview based on the worst possible scenario, as was the EIS, of the potential impact of proposed urban and industrial development in the region on air quality. The study found that levels of hydrocarbon emissions from airport related activities would be less than those currently generated from major urban and commercial developments in western Sydney. Levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from the airport would be comparable with those currently generated from industries such as the ACI Pilkington glassworks. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilot study, therefore, has not produced any evidence to suggest that the operation of Badgerys Creek Airport would result in an impact on air quality greater than anticipated in the second Sydney Airport site selection EIS. The EIS was based on predicted maximum operational levels as specified in a preliminary airport master plan, and was also based on the ultimate development scenario which would be reached only in the very long term future.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of Badgerys Creek Airport will proceed at a pace consistent with the anticipated growth in air traffic demand. Therefore the environmental impacts identified in the site selection EIS for a major airport at Badgerys Creek will not eventuate until well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> As for putting pollution control measures in place before going ahead with the airport, perhaps Mrs Cohen and the Liberal Government in New South Wales should talk to the Minister for Water Resources, because a total water management plan for the site has been developed in close consultation with New South Wales State agencies including the State Pollution Control Commission, the Department of Water Resources and the Water Board. This water management plan provides for specialised stormwater retention basins, pollutant traps and treatment systems to be constructed on the airport site to ensure that the quality of the water run-off conforms with the requirements of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the guidelines issued by the State Pollution Control Commission. These preventative measures have also been specifically designed to ensure that the flooding problem in the area will not be exacerbated by the development of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest Mrs Cohen should also research the reasons why a second airport is needed at Badgerys Creek. More than 13 million passengers pass through Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport each year. The airport employs more than 19,000 people, of whom 16,000 live in the immediate vicinity of the airport, and it contributes in excess of $2,000m to the national economy each year. More than 200,000 aircraft movements occur each year at Kingsford Smith Airport, and it has now been declared as the third worst airport in the Asia-Pacific region by the International Air Transport Association. Kingsford Smith Airport is rapidly approaching crisis point and air traffic problems of congestion are already having a significant impact on our economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I bring to the notice of this House the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation, which will be debated in the Senate but not in this place. It is worthy of discussion in this place because of the effect it may have on firearms imported into Australia. The background for introducing this regulation is a meeting in 1988 of police Ministers from around Australia arising out of the Hoddle Street tragedy in Victoria. All honourable members would agree with me that something had to be done to avoid a further such tragedy in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this regulation repeats some of the fundamental mistakes that were made in Victoria when the then Premier, Mr Cain, introduced changes to the gun laws. I believe that those laws were brought in with good intent but perhaps with some ignorance about guns on the part of members of both sides of the House. I do not claim to be an expert in this area but, coming from the land and being brought up with rifles and shotguns for most of my life, I have a basic idea of what is being spoken about. </PARA>
<PARA> We noticed at that stage of the debate that members who had been brought up in the city really did not know what an automatic rifle was or what a repeater was. For that reason the legislation that came forward upset many legitimate shooters in Victoria. I think that folly is being repeated in the other place with this regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that should be changed, and changed quite quickly, is the provision that is made for the importation of firearms for use in recognised sporting events, with the proviso that the importer or competitor takes the firearms out of Australia in that event. It sounds simple enough, but the net effect of that is that it puts Australia's best sporting shooters at a disadvantage. They cannot have those weapons all the time and they cannot have the latest technology. I do not think anyone would suggest that they are in danger of contributing to a Hoddle Street-type tragedy. They look after their rifles very well, and they should be given all the help they can get. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulation changes the law from prohibiting imports of firearms to the possession of firearms. This is a fundamental change which means that anything that is not covered in this provision may well turn out to be illegal. In other words, something one owns today that it is legal to have may very well be found to be illegal under this provision. That is bad law and may well have a retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make relates to the arbitrary provision that only semi-automatic rifles with more than five rounds are to be prohibited absolutely. This does not take into consideration the needs of so many groups in our community in relation to special sporting events, the eradication of feral animals such as pigs, and so on. These people may not belong to a sporting body but they may have a legitimate use for a weapon of this nature. However, under this regulation they may very well find that the rifles they own today may be illegal or they may not be able to import the latest technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government to look at this regulation and urge its senators to rethink it, to apply a bit of fair play and commonsense to people who carry on a legitimate sport in Australia and who are responsible Australian citizens. All they want to do is get on with their sport without interference from an ill-conceived regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the question of Australia's membership of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). It is now over two years since Australia withdrew from UNIDO, the first and only country ever to do so since the organisation became a specialised agency of the United Nations system. The position of Australia vis-a-vis UNIDO has been the subject of numerous recent reviews which, to my mind, have proven beyond doubt the benefits that our country could gain from renewed membership in the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These benefits are not only financial in that Australian industry will be fully involved in the activities and projects promoted by UNIDO, but also political in that Australia will once again be able to participate fully in the decision making process and contribute to charting the course of the organisation. All our major partners have recognised the influential and profitable role that UNIDO is playing in promoting international cooperation in the industrial sector. Indeed, it is quite abnormal that Australia should not be among the 150 member states of UNIDO. </PARA>
<PARA> Since taking office in September 1986, the present Director-General of UNIDO, Mr Domingo L. Siazon, Jr, has imparted a new spirit to the organisation, bringing it closer to the needs and concerns of industrial enterprises and making it more responsive to their requirements. UNIDO has now been proven to be able to provide swift and effective assistance to its member states through direct contacts not only with governments and governmental institutions but also with private sector industries and industrial associations. The renewed confidence in the organisation and in the services it can render is proven by the increasing number and importance of funding agreements signed with UNIDO by industrial companies in industrialised and developing countries alike. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, UNIDO is positioning itself to play a significant role in the United Nations system's activities for the reconstruction of the countries which suffered from the Gulf conflict. Its long experience in and association with those countries, its knowledge of their industrial structure and potential, its international status and its recognised impartiality render UNIDO a credible and respected partner in that region as well. I do not need to emphasise the significance of Australia's membership in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> The activities of UNIDO extend well beyond the standard concept of technical assistance. The organisation has also been very active in the field of investment promotion, development and transfer of technology and industrial studies and research. The fact that UNIDO has struck out along the right road is confirmed by the developing countries' increasing requests for UNIDO services each year. In 1990, UNIDO delivered close to $US160m worth of technical assistance and successfully promoted $US699m worth of investment projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Australia's absence from the ranks of its member states, UNIDO has continued to involve Australian companies and institutions in its activities. Australian firms have successfully secured purchase and service contracts in respect of major UNIDO projects, especially in the Asian and Pacific regions. I have also been informed that UNIDO and Australia-specifically the Department of Industry, Trade and Technology in South Australia-are jointly organising an international conference entitled `Adding Value to Natural Resources-Petrochemicals and Minerals', which is scheduled to take place from 2 to 4 December this year in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand, and I must confess to being greatly concerned, that it is becoming increasingly difficult for UNIDO to justify to its member states the continued involvement of Australia in its programs. I would therefore request that the Government approve immediate resumption of Australia's membership of UNIDO and that the required financial resources, modest when compared to the benefit that can be derived from membership in the organisation, be allocated for that purpose as a matter of high priority. It would cost Australia something like $1.4m to renew its membership and from that we would get an investment potential in the region of $20m per annum. That $1.4m would be money well invested and we should rejoin immediately. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) Inspectors who are headquartered in towns where there are no longer functioning abattoirs are utilised for either long or short term relief at other abattoirs and meat establishments. The relief requirements may range from relief for recreational leave and sick leave to increases in production requiring additional staff or the backfilling of positions to allow for training of staff. The costs involved are normal travelling allowance (if appropriate) and mileage costs. These costs for the 1989-90 financial year totalled $811 621.49.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) The average cost to AQIS for a meat inspector for the year 1989-90 (as calculated for the charging base) was $51 684.00.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The average gross earnings for a meat inspector for the financial year 1989-90 was $32 444.04.</PARA>
<PARA> The difference between the average cost of an inspector and the average gross earnings of an inspector ($19 239.96) is due to the cost of the administering the respective inspection program and the administrative support required to keep the inspectors in the field.
